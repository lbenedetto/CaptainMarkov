The Crossing
[Bridge] 
REED: Sensors can't identify its hull composition. There doesn't even seem to be a warp signature. 
T'POL: It's approaching at warp six. 
ARCHER: How big is it? 
REED: It's big, more than five hundred metres across. 
HOSHI: We're in visual range. 
ARCHER: Put it up. 
(A big semi-saucer thing comes into view.) 
ARCHER: Look familiar? 
T'POL: It's not in the Vulcan database. 
ARCHER: Try hailing them. 
HOSHI: No response, sir. I'm not even detecting a transceiver on board. 
TRAVIS: They're gaining on us, sir. 
(The pursuing ship breaks open and engulfs little Enterprise.) 
REED: What the hell is that? 
ARCHER: Tactical alert. 
REED: Weapons aren't charging, sir. They're offline. Phase cannons, torpedoes. 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge! 
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead. 
TUCKER: What's going on, Captain? The engines just went down. 
ARCHER [OC]: Warp or impulse? 
TUCKER: Both. 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: Hold on, Trip. Have they dropped out of warp? 
T'POL: There's no way to tell. Our sensors can't penetrate their hull. 
ARCHER: What about our life support? 
T'POL: Fully operational. 
ARCHER: That's one piece of good news. Any biosigns out there? 
T'POL: None that I can detect. 
ARCHER: Rotate the dorsal camera. 
(The image is of a big chamber, and a circular object ahead of them.) 
ARCHER: Hold it there. Tilt up about thirty degrees. Get closer. 
(There are wispy things moving around.) 
T'POL: The vapour doesn't contain any elements our sensors can identify. 
ARCHER: Any atmosphere? 
T'POL: Mostly helium, trace amounts of xenon. 
ARCHER: Prep a shuttlepod. Trip, meet me and Malcolm in Launch bay one. 
TUCKER [OC]: Aye, sir. 
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) You're in charge. Keep a channel open. 
[Alien spaceship] 
(The shuttlepod glides out of the bay down to the floor of the alien ship, then three space-suited figures climb out.) 
REED: Captain, look at this. 
(He holds out a scanner.) 
REED: The atmosphere's changing. Seventy six percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. 
TUCKER: Somebody seems to know what we like to breathe. 
ARCHER: What's the temperature? 
REED: Eighteen degrees. 
TUCKER: Florida in November. 
ARCHER: Let's see what we can find. 
TUCKER: Look at that. 
(The wisps are circling Enterprise.) 
REED: I'm not reading anything. It's like they're not there. 
TUCKER: They sure look there to me. 
REED: If there aren't any life-forms here, then who modified the atmosphere? 
ARCHER: I doubt it's a coincidence. 
TUCKER: Captain. 
(Some light blue wisps swirl around them.)
ARCHER: We may not be detecting any bio-signs, but those things sure look alive to me. 
(One of them gets into Tucker's head, then leaves again, coloured yellow.) 
ARCHER: Are you okay? Trip? 
(The yellow wisp returns, pops into his head and a white one leaves.) 
TUCKER: What the hell happened? 
ARCHER: That's what I was about to ask you. 
TUCKER: I think I was up on the ceiling with those things. I was looking down at the three of us, but not with my eyes. I can't explain it. 
ARCHER: We should get him back to the ship. 
TUCKER: I was in Tarpon Springs, too, swimming with Lisa. She was afraid it was getting too dark. 
REED: It sounds like you were dreaming, Commander. 
TUCKER: I know the difference between a dream and something really happening. 
ARCHER: We're a hundred and fifty light years from Earth, Trip. 
TUCKER: I'm telling you, I was there. 
[Sickbay] 
(Trip is in the Decon chamber.) 
PHLOX: I'm not detecting any parasites or lifeforms or wisps of smoke. He seems in perfect working order. 
ARCHER: He said he had some kind of out-of-body experience. 
TUCKER: I don't forget Florida, Captain. I don't care how far away it is. I was there. 
(Phlox cuts off the intercom.) 
PHLOX: It's a very common hallucination, returning to a familiar place. 
TUCKER: What happened to the comm.? You three talking about me? 
(Phlox switches the intercom back on.) 
PHLOX: You're clear, Commander. Free to go. 
TUCKER: Thanks, Doc. 
[Locker room] 
(Changing out of the space suits back into their uniforms.) 
ARCHER: You sure you're all right? 
TUCKER: I'm fine. I can't believe how amazing it was. 
ARCHER: I'd prefer to keep you in Sickbay for a few days, but I can't afford to. I need you to get those engines back online. 
TUCKER: I'll see what I can do. 
ARCHER: Let me know if you take another trip to Tarpon Beach. 
TUCKER: Tarpon Springs. I'll keep you posted. 
(Tucker leaves.) 
ARCHER: I want those weapons back online, too. 
REED: I'll see what I can do. 
[Ready room] 
ARCHER: Come in. 
(T'Pol enters.) 
ARCHER: It's like we're in the belly of the beast. 
T'POL: We have no reason to believe their motives are hostile. 
ARCHER: They're holding my ship hostage. 
T'POL: We don't know that. 
ARCHER: We don't? Look out there. Do you see any stars? Our engines are offline, our weapons. Seems kind of hostile to me. 
T'POL: I suppose it depends on how you look at it. 
ARCHER: Is there something you wanted to see me about? 
T'POL: Ensign Sato is trying to communicate with the life forms. 
ARCHER: And? 
T'POL: Nothing yet. I've spoken to a number of officers. They say the crew is concerned, but remaining calm. 
ARCHER: I've got to get them out of here. 
[Engineering] 
(A blue wisp enters Tucker, and a yellow one leaves.) 
ROSTOV: I tried re-initialising the plasma flow, but the power grid isn't charging. Commander? Are you all right, sir? Can I get you something? 
TUCKER: I'm fine. Goodbye, sir. 
(Tucker leaves through a small hatch that another crewman just came out of.) 
ROSTOV: Rostov to Captain Archer. 
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead. 
ROSTOV: I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but I think there might be something wrong with Commander Tucker. 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: What do you mean, wrong? 
[Engineering] 
ROSTOV: He was confused, and seemed to think I was his superior officer. 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: I'll be right down. 
ROSTOV [OC]: He's not here, sir. He left Engineering. 
ARCHER: Did he say where he was going? 
[Engineering] 
ROSTOV: No, sir. 
[Bridge] 
ROSTOV [OC]: I'm afraid not, Captain. 
ARCHER: Archer to Commander Tucker. (to T'Pol) Find him. 
[Mess hall] 
(The Tucker thing has a table full of food in front of it when Archer, T'Pol and Reed enter.) 
ARCHER: Commander. 
TUCKER: Commander Charles Tucker III. 
ARCHER: Hungry? 
TUCKER: Yes. It's all very good. Have you ever tried this? 
ARCHER: It's called bread. You've never eaten it before? 
TUCKER: I've never eaten anything before. 
T'POL: Where's Commander Tucker? 
TUCKER: I'm here. Charles Tucker III. 
ARCHER: Where's the man who used to be Charles Tucker? 
TUCKER: He's exploring another realm. My realm. But he'll be back. 
ARCHER: I want him back now. 
TUCKER: Please trust me. He's experiencing things he never thought he could. 
ARCHER: Where is he? 
TUCKER: It's not a question of where. He's no longer corporeal. But he will be again, I assure you. 
REED: When we were outside, we saw a wisp of vapour penetrate him. Did you have anything to do with that? 
TUCKER: Wisp. Interesting word. Wisp. Wisp. Yes, I suppose you could call us that. Wisp. 
ARCHER: Where do you come from? 
TUCKER: We live in subspace. We travel through it. We're explorers, like you. 
ARCHER: Why did you take Commander Tucker? 
TUCKER: It's been a long time since we've encountered corporeal beings. After we performed the first crossing with your commander, we realised we were compatible. You're very interesting. Trapped in bodies that need maintenance. You have gender. You require mates to reproduce. You eat food. We were like you once, but we evolved. Now we can learn how our ancestors lived. 
ARCHER: I want my crewman, and I want my ship released. 
REED: Captain. 
(Through the porthole, we see the ship is moving.) 
TUCKER: Your crewman will be returned. You claim to be an explorer, Captain. Open your mind to new possibilities. 
(Enterprise is released into space.) 
ARCHER: What about Tucker? 
TUCKER: I've enjoyed my time with you. 
REED: Sir. 
(A yellow wisp enters the Mess hall, then Tucker, and a blue one leaves.) 
TUCKER: Wow. 
ARCHER: Wow what? 
TUCKER: I was riding right alongside Hopalong Cassidy chasing some bad guys. Then I was with Lisa again, except this time we were snow sailing in New Zealand. Then I was eight years old, maybe nine, picking up leaves with my dad. But it wasn't a dream, Captain. It was as real as I'm sitting here. They told me you can try it. Anyone on the crew. 
ARCHER: Who told you? 
TUCKER: They did. The ones I was with. 
ARCHER: I thought you were with Hopalong Cassidy and your girlfriend. 
TUCKER: I was, but it's hard to explain. You should try it. You'll understand what I'm talking about. You all should try it. 
ARCHER: Take him to Sickbay. 
TUCKER: Captain, I'm fine. 
ARCHER: We'll let the Doctor decide how fine you are. 
REED: Commander. 
(Reed and Tucker leave.) 
ARCHER: Something smells funny. 
T'POL: They've released the ship and Commander Tucker. They've done everything you've asked. Have you considered they may have been telling the truth when they said they were just curious about us? 
[Ready room] 
ARCHER: Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Now that the Doctor's given Trip a clean bill of health, my primary concern is to get Enterprise out of here. But Trip tells me it'll be awhile before he can get the engines online. From what we can tell, these life forms have no mass. Non-corporeal beings. that's got to be a first for Starfleet. T'Pol thinks they just want to get to know us. Maybe she's right. Maybe I don't trust them because they're so different. I'd hate to think that was the case. (doorbell chime) Computer, pause. Come in. 
PHLOX: I hope I'm not disturbing you. 
ARCHER: Everything all right? 
PHLOX: I'm not certain. One of those beings appeared in Sickbay a few minutes ago. It entered me right here. 
(Phlox indicates his forehead.) 
PHLOX: But my physiology must not have been compatible. It left almost immediately. 
ARCHER: Are you sure you're all right? 
PHLOX: I'm fine. But it was disturbing. The lifeform was trying very hard to reach me.
(In the Armoury, Reed spots the reflection of a blue wisp in a fixture, and makes a dash for it. He tries shooting at it, but of course that has no effect. It catches him in a corridor, where he has an appreciative look at a departing woman.) 
[Turbolift] 
CREWWOMAN: I'm going to B deck. 
REED: B deck is fine. Are you a female? 
CREWWOMAN: Sir? 
REED: Your gender. You are a female, correct? 
CREWWOMAN: Last time I checked. 
REED: I am a male. 
CREWWOMAN: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. 
REED: There seem to be a number of anatomical differences. 
CREWWOMAN: Sir. 
(She walks out of the lift, leaving him to select another destination.) 
[T'Pol's quarters] 
(She is in her casual clothes reading a book when the doorbell chimes.) 
T'POL: Come in. 
REED: Sub-Commander. 
T'POL: Is there something I can do for you? 
REED: You are very beautiful. Are you aware that you are the most attractive woman on board this ship? 
T'POL: Do you think it's appropriate for you to be here at this hour? 
REED: Would you mind taking off your clothing? I'd like to learn more about your anatomy. 
T'POL: Have you been drinking? 
REED: If we are to engage in mating, it would be easier if you disrobed. 
T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer. 
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead. 
T'POL: Would you please come to my quarters with a security team. 
ARCHER [OC]: We're on our way. 
REED: Are you afraid of me? You shouldn't be. 
T'POL: I'm capable of defending myself. 
REED: What is it like being a female? Is it much different? 
T'POL: I wouldn't know. 
REED: If you'd allow the crossing, you'd find out. 
T'POL: I don't understand. 
REED: If you came to us, you could experience what it's like to be male. Wouldn't that be helpful to you? 
T'POL: I've never thought about it. 
REED: You should. We're capable of letting you experience anything you wish for. It would be a shame not to take advantage of that. 
(As he reaches to touch her face, the door opens and T'Pol moves away.) 
T'POL: This isn't Lieutenant Reed. 
ARCHER: Enough! Humans don't like doing things without their consent. When are you planning to return Malcolm Reed? 
REED: That depends. 
ARCHER: Oh, does it? Let's see how much you enjoy experiencing the human condition locked in Reed's quarters. 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: Tucker. 
ARCHER [OC]: They've got Malcolm. I need the ship 
[Corridor] 
ARCHER: Ready to go on my command. 
TUCKER [OC]: They're going to give him back, aren't they? 
ARCHER: We'll see. 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: What did you do with the, er? 
[Corridor] 
ARCHER: A security detail locked him in Malcolm's quarters. Get it down, Trip. 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: Right away, sir. You heard him. (to Rostov) Let's try to prime the deuterium pumps and fire up the injectors. Tucker to Ensign Cook. 
COOK [OC]: Yes, sir. 
TUCKER: I need you and two other engineers down here right away. 
COOK [OC]: I'll see who I can find. 
ROSTOV [OC]: Commander! 
TUCKER: Quickly please. Tucker out. Something wrong? 
(He goes to where Rostov is just staring at a control board.) 
TUCKER: Run into a problem? 
ROSTOV: Problem? No, everything's fine. 
TUCKER: Did you have any luck priming the pumps? 
ROSTOV: I have no idea how to do that. This engine is very complex. 
TUCKER: Stay here. I'll be right back. Tucker to the Captain. 
[Turbolift] 
ARCHER: Go ahead, Trip. 
TUCKER [OC]: It's Rostov, sir. I think you need to get Malcolm. 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: I mean, whoever's running Security, down here right away. 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: Hoshi, get a security team to Engineering. Have them put Crewman Rostov in his quarters. 
HOSHI: Aye, sir. Captain, we've been getting reports from all over the ship. Some of the crew are acting very strange. 
ARCHER: Then we're going to need more than one security team. Find out who's acting strange and have them confined to their quarters. 
TRAVIS: How do we know the security officers are okay? 
ARCHER: For the moment, we're going to have to hope they are. (to T'Pol) Start working on a way to figure out who's themselves and who's not. Maybe Phlox can help you. 
[Engineering] 
(Tucker is staring at a Tactical Alert display.) 
COOK: Commander. 
TUCKER: Run into a problem? 
COOK: No, sir. Just ready to calibrate the dilithium matrix. 
TUCKER: Great. Wait till I give you the signal. 
[Bridge] 
HOSHI: We polarised the hull plating as soon as we detected that ship. Obviously it didn't do any good. What's keeping them from taking all of us? 
ARCHER: Archer. 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: You've got impulse engines back, Captain. 
ARCHER [OC]: Thanks, Trip. 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: (to Travis) Hold our position. 
HOSHI: I thought you said we needed to get out of here. 
ARCHER: They've got Malcolm, and God knows how many others. Until we find a way to get them back, we're not going anywhere. 
[Sickbay] 
ARCHER: What's the big secret? 
T'POL: We thought it best not to discuss this over the comm. We don't know who's been taken. 
ARCHER: What have you got? 
PHLOX: It was simpler than I thought. Elevated acetylcholine levels in the autonomic nervous 
ARCHER: Doctor, whatever you've got, we need to put it to work. 
PHLOX: The Sub-Commander programmed the medical computer. It's modifying this hand-scanner as we speak. 
ARCHER: Get to work as soon as you're ready. 
[Bridge] 
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Ensign Mayweather. 
TRAVIS: Go ahead, sir. 
TUCKER [OC]: I'm a little short-handed, Travis. 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: Think I could get you to go back to the starboard nacelle and re-polarise the warp coils? 
[Bridge] 
TRAVIS: No problem, sir. 
TUCKER [OC]: Call me when you get to the catwalk. 
TRAVIS: I'm on my way. 
[Mess hall] 
(T'Pol and Phlox are at a table having drinks while lots of crew are getting meals and socialising.) 
T'POL: There are two here. 
PHLOX: Ensign Cole and Crewman Rossi. 
(T'Pol goes out, and returns with a couple of burly security men.) 
[Catwalk] 
TRAVIS: Mayweather to the Bridge. 
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead. 
TRAVIS: One of those things just followed me up the starboard strut, but when I got into the catwalk it didn't come through. There must be something keeping it from getting in here. 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: Then you'd better stay where you are. 
TRAVIS [OC]: Aye, sir. 
ARCHER: Archer to Commander Tucker. 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: Yes, Captain? 
ARCHER [OC]: Is there some kind of shielding 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: In the nacelles that might keep these aliens from getting in? 
[Engineering] 
TUCKER: The catwalk's reinforced with osmium alloy, but it's hard to say if that would do it. 
ARCHER [OC]: Travis thinks it will. 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: I need you to stop whatever you're doing and transfer all command functions 
[Engineering] 
ARCHER [OC]: To the starboard catwalk. We're going to have to get everybody in there. 
TUCKER: I'm on it. 
[Bridge] 
ARCHER: I want you and T'Pol to get the crew up there as quickly as you can. Hoshi. 
HOSHI: It would be best if they stayed where they were. 
ARCHER: What? 
HOSHI: We're offering them a great opportunity. They may never get another chance to experience existence as we do. 
ARCHER: Security to the Bridge. You're taking over my crew. Why? 
HOSHI: I understand how you may be frightened by all this. Losing your substance, existing as perceptive energy, but you'll be grateful once you've made the crossing, I promise you. 
ARCHER: We're kind of fond of our substance. We're not very anxious to give it up. 
HOSHI: Those who've preceded you are safe and happy. They'll understand. 
ARCHER: Are you doing this for our benefit or for yours? 
(Two security guards arrive.) 
ARCHER: Escort Ensign Sato to her quarters. 
HOSHI: You'll understand. 
[Catwalk] 
(Lights are up and people are settling in like last time.) 
ARCHER: How many? 
T'POL: Fifty eight, including us. 
ARCHER: And outside? 
T'POL: Twenty four locked in their quarters, and Doctor Phlox. 
ARCHER: You okay, Travis? 
TRAVIS: I'm fine, sir. Thank you. 
ARCHER: Trip? 
TRAVIS: I saw him down near the Command Compartment. 
ARCHER: Thanks. 
T'POL: We need to learn more about these life forms. 
ARCHER: What we need is to get our people back. 
T'POL: It's illogical to believe we can do that without learning more about the aliens' intentions. 
ARCHER: Do you have something in mind? 
T'POL: I'd like your permission to leave the catwalk. 
ARCHER: You wouldn't have a chance. One of those things would take you before you got back to the saucer section. 
T'POL: Not necessarily. If a lifeform attempts to exchange its consciousness with mine, I believe I can prevent it. 
ARCHER: What makes you think that? 
T'POL: No offence, Captain, but the Vulcan mind is far more disciplined that yours. It can resist temptations, emotions, and I believe, invasions by these lifeforms. 
ARCHER: Even if you're right, what would you accomplish? 
T'POL: If an alien attempts this transfer, there may be a brief period when our minds are conjoined. It's possible I can ascertain their motives. 
ARCHER: It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it. 
T'POL: There's no other choice. 
ARCHER: And if you're wrong? 
T'POL: It's a risk I'm willing to take. 
ARCHER: Well, I'm not. They've already taken twenty four people. I'm not going to give them another one. 
T'POL: You told me you trust my judgment. Trust it now, unless you have another suggestion. 
[Sickbay] 
(The comm. beeps.) 
PHLOX: Sickbay. 
HOSHI [OC]: There's been an accident. 
PHLOX: Hoshi? 
HOSHI [OC]: Hoshi Sato's been injured. I don't know how to repair the damage to her body. 
PHLOX: What happened? 
HOSHI [OC]: Her leg is fractured. She's in considerable pain. She needs assistance. 
[Hoshi's quarters] 
(Phlox has brought a phase pistol with him. He presses the intercom.) 
PHLOX: I'm armed. If you're near the door, step away. 
HOSHI [OC]: She's on the floor. She can't move. 
(He enters, and keeps the pistol pointed at her while he does a scan from just our of reach.) 
PHLOX: There's nothing the matter with you. 
(Hoshi jumps him as he's looking at the scanner. They fight and she gets the pistol, but she's lying on the floor and he has hold of one of her legs.) 
HOSHI: I need to find the rest of your crew. Where are they? 
(Phlox gets a hypospray from his bag and injects her. She passes out.) 
PHLOX: (to spray) I'm glad I brought you along. 
[Corridor] 
(Phlox's communicator chirps.) 
PHLOX: Doctor Phlox. 
ARCHER [OC]: Is everything going all right, Doc? 
PHLOX: More or less. 
ARCHER [OC]: Good. T'Pol and I are going to need your help. 
(T'Pol has left the starboard nacelle and is walking along the corridors when a blue wisp finds her and enters her head.) 
PHLOX: Sub-Commander? T'Pol? 
(She's standing motionless.) 
PHLOX: Have you succeeded? 
(He scans her.) 
PHLOX: Phlox to Captain Archer. 
[Catwalk] 
ARCHER: Did you find her? 
PHLOX [OC]: I'm with her now. She's not acting like the others 
[Corridor] 
PHLOX: But she's certainly not herself. 
[Catwalk] 
ARCHER: Doesn't sound like that's the outcome she expected. 
PHLOX [OC]: Her neural pathways are hyperstimulated. 
ARCHER: Damn it. You'd better take her to her quarters. 
PHLOX [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
[Corridor] 
PHLOX: Come with me. Everything will be all right. 
(He cannot budge her so he gets our the hypospray again.) 
PHLOX: I'm afraid I have to insist. I promise you 
(Then the blue wisp leaves her, she slumps and he catches her.) 
PHLOX: T'Pol! What is my name? Sub-Commander! 
T'POL: They're lying to us. 
PHLOX: My name. 
T'POL: We don't have time for this, Phlox. I have to get to the Captain. 
[Catwalk command area] 
T'POL: Their ship is deteriorating, and they have no way to repair it. They can't survive in space. 
ARCHER: So they are doing this to save themselves. 
T'POL: Eighty two of them are. One for every crewman on Enterprise. 
TRAVIS: How many of them are there? 
T'POL: Hundreds. The rest will try to find another vessel of corporeal beings. Where's Commander Tucker? 
TRAVIS: I'm not sure. 
T'POL: Please find him. 
(Travis leaves.) 
T'POL: If the Commander can find a way to shield Enterprise, we can leave the catwalk and go to warp. 
ARCHER: And lose a third of the crew? 
T'POL: Two thirds will survive. 
ARCHER: Unacceptable. We're going to find a way to get them back. 
T'POL: That may be difficult. 
ARCHER: Can they survive in a host that's dead? 
T'POL: It would be no different than being exposed to space. They'd die. 
ARCHER: Archer to Phlox. 
PHLOX [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
[Catwalk] 
(Travis is walking along, looking for Tucker. The crew look rather worried.) 
TRAVIS: Are you doing all right? 
CREWMAN: We're okay. 
CREWMAN 2: How long do you think we'll be in here, Ensign? 
TRAVIS: I'm sure the Captain will get us out as soon as he can. Has anyone seen Commander Tucker? 
CREWMAN: No, sir. 
CREWMAN 2: Not for a while. I think he was down there. 
TRAVIS: Thanks. 
[Locker room] 
(Phlox is getting into a space suit.) 
PHLOX: We'll have to purge the carbon dioxide within twenty seconds of respiratory failure. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: That'll give you enough time to resuscitate them? 
PHLOX [OC]: Oh, yes. 
[Locker room] 
PHLOX: It's enough time. Don't forget to close off the ventilation to the starboard nacelle. 
[Catwalk command area] 
PHLOX [OC]: We wouldn't want the gas to affect you and the others. 
ARCHER: Understood. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, Captain, I can't find Commander Tucker. 
ARCHER: Has anyone opened either of the ventral hatches? 
T'POL: Not since we sealed them. 
ARCHER: You must've missed him. 
TRAVIS: I'll look again. 
[Atmosphere control] 
(Phlox is reading the numbers on the panels.) 
PHLOX: Four, five, six, seven. 
ARCHER [OC]: All right. Does it have an ID tag? 
PHLOX: Junction four one alpha. Atmospheric 
[Catwalk command area] 
PHLOX [OC]: Recycling manifold. 
ARCHER: Good. Do you see the releases on either side? 
PHLOX [OC]: Yes. There are four of them. 
(Tucker is standing watching through a grid, looking impassive.) 
PHLOX [OC]:Two blue. 
[Atmosphere control] 
PHLOX: Two silver. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Open them. The silver ones first. 
[Atmosphere control] 
PHLOX: Done. 
ARCHER: Now pull the panel off. 
PHLOX: What should I do with it? 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Whatever you want. 
[Atmosphere control] 
ARCHER [OC]: Lay it down on the floor. 
PHLOX: Very well. 
(He pulls it off to reveal a right angled pipe and a load of lights.) 
PHLOX: Right where you said it was, Captain. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Find the control panel. 
[Atmosphere control] 
PHLOX: It's right here. It has six green lights. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Each of them should have a switch next to it. 
PHLOX [OC]: About five centimetres to the left. 
ARCHER: Now, before we can release the gas into central ventilation, you're going to have to reroute the transfer lines to the carbon dioxide tanks. 
(Tucker leaves quietly.) 
[Atmosphere control] 
PHLOX: And how do I go about doing that? 
[Catwalk command area] 
T'POL: Those six switches control the feed. You're going to have to recalibrate them in sequence for CO2. 
[Atmosphere control] 
T'POL [OC]: I'll guide you through it.
TRAVIS: Commander, I've been looking all over for you! Are you all right, sir? 
(Tucker is working busily at a wall control panel, then abruptly gets onto the catwalk and walks briskly away.) 
TUCKER: I'm fine. 
TRAVIS: The Captain asked me to find you. He needs you in the Command Compartment. Commander! 
(Tucker breaks into a run, knocking crewmen aside then goes to open the hatch.) 
TRAVIS: You can't go out there, sir. It's not safe! 
(He gets pushed away.) 
TRAVIS: What are you doing? 
(Travis gets hit, hard, then Tucker goes down the ladder to the main body of the ship.) 
[Corridor] 
PHLOX: I've reached the access tube, Captain. 
ARCHER [OC]: Good. Now pull off the panel. 
PHLOX: (heaves at the bar) It's not coming off. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: It'll come off. You just need to use a little muscle. 
[Corridor] 
PHLOX: I've used every muscle I've got. it won't budge. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Try using your foot 
[Corridor] 
ARCHER [OC]: For leverage. 
(It comes away so suddenly he falls against the bulkhead opposite) 
PHLOX: Good suggestion. 
ARCHER [OC]: Okay. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Now, the next part's a piece of cake. 
TRAVIS: We've got a problem, Captain. 
ARCHER: Stand by, Doc. What happened? 
TRAVIS: Commander Tucker. He just went out the forward hatch. 
ARCHER: What? 
TRAVIS: I tried to stop him, sir. He didn't look like himself. I think one of those things got inside him. 
T'POL: If he knows what we're doing. 
ARCHER: We're going to have to speed things up, Doc. Trip's been taken. He left the catwalk a few minutes ago. 
[Corridor] 
ARCHER [OC]: If he tries to let his buddies out of their quarters we don't have any guards down there to stop him. 
PHLOX: Tell me what to do. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: You'll have to purge the osmotic filters. 
[Corridor] 
ARCHER [OC]: The valves are right behind the control circuit. You're going to have to get two fingers through the upper holes in the support plate. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but wearing those gloves 
[Corridor] 
ARCHER [OC]: Could make it difficult. 
PHLOX: Back home, I'm known for my fine motor skills. I doubt a pair of EV gloves 
[Catwalk command area] 
PHLOX [OC]: Will deter me. 
T'POL: There are two solenoids behind the openings. When you tap them simultaneously, the plate should retract. 
[Corridor] 
PHLOX: Did you say there were two? 
[Catwalk command area] 
(Archer checks the schematic on the monitor/.) 
ARCHER: About three centimetres apart. 
[Corridor] 
PHLOX: Got it. 
ARCHER [OC]: You should be looking at two rotary valves and a lever. 
PHLOX: I see them. 
ARCHER [OC]: Open both valves all the way, then turn the lever to the three o'clock position. That should do it. 
(Phlox seals his helmet shut.) 
T'POL: T'POL: The nine o'clock position will vent the gas when we're finished. 
(As Phlox reaches for the lever, Tucker grabs his arm, throws him away and starts closing the valves instead. Hitting him with the metal cover doesn't stop him, but a headbutt from a space helmet does. The CO2 is released while the possessed engineer tries to move the lever back, and he passes out.) 
PHLOX: Phlox to Captain Archer. 
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead. 
PHLOX: Mission accomplished. 
[Catwalk command area] 
PHLOX [OC]: I'm monitoring Commander Tucker. 
ARCHER: Good job. 
(Throughout the ship, possessed crew pass out, yellow wisps return home and blue ones leave.) 
[Corridor] 
PHLOX: It's left Commander Tucker. 
ARCHER [OC]: Vent the gas. 
PHLOX: In a moment, Captain. I need to be certain the CO2 levels are consistent throughout the ship, that all the lifeforms are gone. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Ready, Travis? 
TRAVIS: (at the helm) Yes, sir. 
[Corridor] 
PHLOX: It's done. 
[Catwalk command area] 
ARCHER: Full impulse. 
T'POL: They're in pursuit. 
(The big ship opens it's maw again.) 
T'POL: Stand by. Now. 
(Archer fires two torpedoes at it. They detonate within the cavernous body and the ship falls to pieces.) 
[Corridor] 
TUCKER: What's going on, Doc? 
PHLOX: Just breathe deeply. You'll be fine. 
TUCKER: I was just at a barbecue. 
PHLOX: In through the nose, out through the mouth. 
TUCKER: I've never seen so many ribs. (Phlox helps him to his feet.) 
PHLOX: Follow me, Commander. We have a lot of doors to unlock.
