Shattered Mirror
[Promenade - upper level] 
(Jake is at the old place, gazing into nothing.) 
ODO: Enjoying the view? 
JAKE: I'm stuck on this new story I'm working on, and coming here helps me focus. 
ODO: No need to explain, Mister Sisko. 
JAKE: I just thought 
ODO: You just thought what? 
JAKE: I thought you were going to ask me to leave. 
ODO: Why would I do that? 
JAKE: You always used to chase me away. 
ODO: I never chased you away. I chased Nog. You just happened to be with him. So, unless you're planning on flicking sand peas at the passing throng, you're welcome to stay here as long as you like. 
JAKE: I don't have any sand peas. 
ODO: You miss him, don't you? 
JAKE: Nog? Maybe a little. 
QUARK: A little? There isn't a day goes by that I don't see him standing here, pining away for that no-good nephew of mine. 
JAKE: I'm not here every day. 
QUARK: No, just four or five times a week. If you ask me, Nog should never have gone off to the Academy. You lost a friend, and I lost a good waiter. 
JAKE: Nog'll be back, and he'll be wearing a Starfleet uniform. I'm proud of what he's doing. 
QUARK: Remember that the next time you try to play dom-jot by yourself. 
JAKE: You don't want me hanging around here? Fine. I'll do my thinking someplace else. 
(Jake leaves.) 
QUARK: Poor kid. I suppose that's what you get for having friends. 
ODO: Meaning what? 
QUARK: Just that when you think you can count on them, they go off and leave you. No. You're much better off without them. 
ODO: I imagine that's why you don't have any friends. 
QUARK: Look who's talking. 
[Sisko's quarters] 
JAKE: Dad, I'm home. 
(Sisko is sitting on the settee with Jennifer Sisko, his dead mother) 
JAKE: Mom? 
(After the credits, when Jake has picked his jaw back up off the floor.) 
JENNIFER: I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. 
SISKO: This is the woman I told you about. The one I met in the parallel universe. 
JAKE: So you're Jennifer Sisko, but you're just not my mom. 
JENNIFER: That's right. 
JAKE: You look exactly like her. 
JENNIFER: And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? 
JAKE: More than a little. Did you tell her? 
SISKO: Tell her what? 
JAKE: Ever since my dad told me about you I've been wanting to meet you. 
JENNIFER: Well, here I am. 
JAKE: You even sound like my mother. 
KIRA [OC]: Ops to Captain Sisko. 
SISKO: Go ahead. 
KIRA [OC]: Minister Gettor's shuttle has docked. 
SISKO: Give me a few minutes. Offer him a tour of the station. 
KIRA [OC]: I already have. His time here is limited and he's anxious to meet with the Emissary. 
SISKO: I'll be right there. 
JAKE: So why are you here? 
JENNIFER: I came here to see your father. 
JAKE: Really? That's great. 
SISKO: Jennifer came to give me some good news. The Terrans have won an important victory. 
JENNIFER: We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. 
JAKE: Then the rebels control Terok Nor. 
JENNIFER: I see your father has told you all about us. 
SISKO: I guess I'd better get to my meeting. 
JENNIFER: I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. 
JAKE: You're not leaving, are you? 
JENNIFER: Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? 
SISKO: I don't think Jake would have it any other way. 
JENNIFER: Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. 
SISKO: That depends on how long my meeting lasts. 
JENNIFER: We'll wait. 
SISKO: Okay. 
(Sisko leaves) 
JAKE: Would you like another raktajino? 
JENNIFER: Thank you. That would be nice. 
JAKE: That's amazing. 
JENNIFER: What? 
JAKE: I never thought I'd hold these hands again. They feel just like my mother's. I'll get you that raktajino. 
[Captain's office] 
(The Minister and his entourage leave through Ops.) 
KIRA: That went well. I think you made it clear to the Minister why the Emissary can't endorse his land reform programme. 
SISKO: It only took three hours. 
KIRA: If you like, we can go over the weekly personnel reports. 
SISKO: In the morning. I've got someone waiting for me in my quarters. 
[Sisko's quarters] 
(Empty room) 
SISKO: Jake? Jennifer? 
SISKO: Computer, locate Jake Sisko. 
COMPUTER: Jake Sisko is not on the station. 
(Sisko spots the mirror transporter adapter.) 
[Ops] 
O'BRIEN: Are you sure this is what Smiley used to transport you to the alternate universe? 
SISKO: Looks like it. 
DAX: And you're convinced Jake's gone over there? 
SISKO: He's not on the station and neither is Jennifer. 
KIRA: Maybe he convinced her to take him over there for a visit. 
SISKO: Without asking me? 
DAX: It could be she left that behind as an invitation to join them. 
SISKO: And I accept. But only to get Jake back. 
KIRA: Want some company? I can think of safer places to visit. 
SISKO: Major, you and the Chief come with me. Commander, you have Ops. 
(Kira gets phasers for all) 
O'BRIEN: Expecting trouble, Major? 
KIRA: Just want to be prepared. 
(Sisko waves the mirror gizmo over the transporter controls.) 
SISKO: Energise. 
(But only Sisko beams out) 
[Terok Nor Ops] 
O'BRIEN: Welcome back, Captain. 
SISKO: What happened to the others? 
O'BRIEN: They weren't invited. 
SISKO: Where's my son? 
O'BRIEN: He's with Professor Sisko. She's showing him the station. 
SISKO: The tour's over. I'm taking Jake home. 
O'BRIEN: Then I'm afraid we have a problem. 
SISKO: What kind of problem? 
O'BRIEN: Jake's not going anywhere. 
(Armed men arrive, and Sisko's phaser is taken off him.) 
O'BRIEN: and neither are you. 
[Intendant's office] 
O'BRIEN: Terok Nor in rebel hands. It just shows what people can do when their cause is just. 
SISKO: Save the speeches, Smiley. Right now, I don't care too much for you or your cause. 
O'BRIEN: You've every right to be angry. We haven't exactly played fair with you. 
SISKO: You kidnapped my son. 
O'BRIEN: Kidnapped? An ugly word. 
SISKO: But accurate. 
O'BRIEN: Tell me, Captain. If we had come and asked for your help in fighting the Alliance, what would you have said? 
SISKO: I'd have said no. 
O'BRIEN: Which is why we had to use your son to lure you over here. We need your help, Captain. No one else will do. 
(Brings up an image on the viewscreen.) 
O'BRIEN: Recognise her? 
SISKO: Wow. The Defiant. 
O'BRIEN: During our last encounter, when I visited your station, I took a moment to download as many of your computer files as I could. I figured they'd come in handy some day. And they have. You see, captain, taking Terok Nor was one thing. Keeping it, that's the tricky part. The Alliance fleet is already on its way. When they get here, I want to have a proper welcome ready for them. 
SISKO: These schematics look complete. Why do you need me? If you want to build another Defiant, why do you need my help? 
O'BRIEN: We've already built it. The problem is, when we power up its engines, the whole ship damn near shakes itself apart. 
SISKO: We had the same trouble. It's a powerful ship. 
O'BRIEN: Well, right now it's a little too powerful for its own good. How did you solve it? 
SISKO: We had to overhaul the structural integrity field grids. 
O'BRIEN: How long did it take? 
SISKO: Two weeks. 
O'BRIEN: We have four days. 
SISKO: I'm not sure that's enough time. 
O'BRIEN: It'd better be. Otherwise the Defiant won't be ready, and you and your son will die along with the rest of us. Or worse still, spend the rest of your lives working in the ore processing centre under the tender mercies of an Alliance overseer. Help us, Captain, and I promise we'll get you and your son out of here before the fireworks begin. The Defiant's at docking port five. I think you know the way. 
SISKO: I want to see my son first. 
O'BRIEN: I knew you would. 
BASHIR: Is he with us? 
O'BRIEN: You remember Captain Bashir. 
SISKO: Captain? 
O'BRIEN: Captain Bashir, Captain O'Brien, Captain Sisko. We may not have enough troops or ships or weapons, but we have plenty of captains. 
BASHIR: Is he going to help us or not? 
O'BRIEN: You must have missed that cheery face. Relax. The Captain has found it in his heart to aid us once again. 
BASHIR: Good. 
(Bashir punches Sisko.) 
BASHIR: I owed you that. I let you hit me once because I thought you were our Captain Sisko. Now I know better. 
SISKO: We're even now. 
(Sisko leaves) 
O'BRIEN: If I were you, I'd keep out of his way. 
[Terok Nor Quark's] 
NOG: You and I friends? I don't think so. 
JAKE: Why not? 
NOG: You're too tall. I don't trust tall men. Tall women, that's a different story. Here. See for yourself. 
(Nog passes one of his statuesque dabo girls over to Jake.) 
JENNIFER: Jake, isn't she a little old for you? 
NOG: Who are you, his mother? 
SISKO: Jake! 
JAKE: Dad. I'm sorry, but I had to come. Somehow, talking to Jennifer, telling her all about the past nine years, about all the things that happened to me, what I've done, what I've been thinking about. It's like telling Mom. 
SISKO: In a lot of ways she's nothing like your Mom. 
JAKE: Yeah, but in some ways, she's just like her. And not just physically. She listens like Mom. And it's the exact same smile. 
SISKO: Okay, Jake. 
JAKE: This place is unbelievable. Chief O'Brien, Doctor Bashir, Dax, they're all here. I know, it's not really them but, look here's Nog. This is my father. 
NOG: He's tall, too. 
SISKO: Sorry. Look, Jake-o, I have to talk to Jennifer alone for a minute. 
JAKE: She likes you. 
SISKO: Jake, whatever you're thinking, whatever plans you're making, forget about them. 
JAKE: I'm not making any plans. 
SISKO: (to Jennifer) Outside. 
[Terok Nor Promenade] 
SISKO: I just want to know one thing. Whose idea was this? 
JENNIFER: Does it matter? 
SISKO: It does to me. 
JENNIFER: It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. 
SISKO: You're nothing like his mother. 
JENNIFER: I think Jake would disagree. 
SISKO: Of course he would. In his mind, the three of us are already living together. 
JENNIFER: Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. 
SISKO: It's not your cause that I have a problem with, it's your methods. 
JENNIFER: I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. 
SISKO: All right, I'm here and I'm going to help you. But I want you to leave my son alone. 
JENNIFER: I can't. 
SISKO: Why not? 
JAKE: Jennifer! 
JENNIFER: Because he won't leave me alone. 
[Klingon Bridge] 
(This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) 
KLINGON: Bow before the Regent! 
GARAK: I can't think of anything I'd rather do. 
(The chain is handed to the Regent.) 
WORF: Ah. So this is the p'tak who lost Terok Nor to the rebels. 
GARAK: It's not exactly 
WORF: Are you calling me a liar? 
GARAK: I was merely observing that as one of many officers under the Intendant's command, it would be an overstatement to imply that I alone was responsible for our defeat. 
WORF: But you are the only officer who managed to escape. 
GARAK: Perhaps I should have surrendered to the rebels, grovelling on the floor, begging for my life like the Intendant. 
WORF: You are attempting to shift blame away from yourself. 
GARAK: Am I succeeding? 
WORF: This time I will deal with the rebels myself. You will be at my side, redeeming yourself in battle. 
GARAK: Your fairness and good judgement are everything I've heard it to be. Believe me, my Regent, it will take the blood of many rebels to quench the thirst of my revenge. 
WORF: Spoken like a Klingon. 
GARAK: I'm trying. Now, if you could just remove this insufferable collar. 
WORF: No. The collar stays until every rebel on Terok Nor lies dead at my feet. 
[Defiant Bridge] 
(There's a construction gantry around the ship and a lot of work going on inside.) 
SISKO: (to com) Sisko to Smiley. I'm about to put the deuterium injector back online. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Go ahead. 
[Engine room] 
O'BRIEN: I've got the flow regulators shut off. 
[Defiant Bridge] 
SISKO: Injectors are operational. You can recalibrate the regulators now. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Will do. 
DAX: I heard you were back. 
(She slaps him) 
DAX: That's for making love to me under false pretenses. I was suspicious of you from the start. 
SISKO: You hid it well. 
DAX: If you ever try to touch me again. (She produces a dagger) Do yet my point? 
SISKO: I hope not. 
(There's a frizz and someone screams.) 
[Corridor] 
(Kira is on the floor gasping in pain, Bashir standing over her with an agoniser) 
SISKO: What happened? 
BASHIR: Ah. You remember the Intendant, don't you? I was taking her to an interrogation session when the vile little tyrant tried to escape. 
(She gets another agoniser jolt.) 
BASHIR: Oops. 
SISKO: Pick her up. 
BASHIR: Leave her. She's not through with her lesson. 
KIRA: If this is supposed to teach me a lesson you might want to turn that little toy of yours to a higher setting. 
BASHIR: Gladly. 
(And does so.) 
SISKO: That's enough. 
BASHIR: Whose side are you on? 
SISKO: There's a difference between interrogation and torture. 
BASHIR: The Alliance never made that distinction. 
SISKO: But you should. 
BASHIR: Take her back to her cell. 
(Dax caresses Bashir.) 
KIRA: Well done. Now I have to admit, the last time you were here you had me completely fooled. I really thought you were my Benjamin Sisko. 
SISKO: That was the idea. 
KIRA: (sotto) Help me escape and I promise I'll be grateful. Very grateful. 
SISKO: (sotto) I'm sure you would be. But don't count on it. 
KIRA: Well then perhaps you'll find Marani and have her sent to my holding cell. 
SISKO: Marani? 
KIRA: One of my servants. I am a touch sore. And she does give the most exquisite massages. 
(Intendant Kira is hauled away laughing.) 
[Klingon Bridge] 
WORF: A ship? What kind of ship? 
KLINGON: According to our reports, it's of unknown classification and carries an impressive weapons array. Some kind of improved photon torpedoes, multi-targeting phaser banks. 
WORF: How long until it is operational? 
KLINGON: Within two days. 
GARAK: I know it's none of my business but perhaps it would be prudent to increase our speed to warp nine. 
WORF: Quiet! 
GARAK: I was merely trying to be of service. 
WORF: If it was not for your incompetence, the rebels would have been destroyed. 
GARAK: I thought we had agreed that it was the Intendant who was incompetent. I was merely following her orders. 
WORF: And for following those orders you deserve to die. 
GARAK: Then why don't you kill me? The Intendant was bad enough. She was irrational, accusatory, unappreciative. But at least 
WORF: At least what? 
GARAK: At least I was able to please her now and then. 
WORF: You are not my type. 
GARAK: I never said I was. 
WORF: Increase speed to warp nine. 
[Jennifer's quarters] 
(Dinner for two.) 
JAKE: So, what do you think? 
JENNIFER: It was delicious. What do you call it? 
JAKE: Chicken a la Sisko. 
JENNIFER: How did you learn to cook like this? 
JAKE: Well, all Sisko men have the cooking gene. You should try my Dad's shrimp Creole. 
JENNIFER: Maybe one day I will. 
(Doorbell) 
JENNIFER: Come in. 
SISKO: Jake, it's time to call it a day. 
JENNIFER: How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. 
SISKO: I am too tired to eat. Jake-o. 
JAKE: In a minute, Dad. I don't want to leave a mess. 
JENNIFER: Oh, that's really not necessary. 
JAKE: No, I want to. 
(Jake clears the plates.) 
JENNIFER: How's the work on the Defiant coming? 
SISKO: Slowly. 
(Jennifer massages his shoulders.) 
JENNIFER: Does that feel better? 
SISKO: Yes, but I don't know what you expect to gain by it. 
JENNIFER: I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. 
SISKO: You're not making that job any easier. 
JENNIFER: Oh, he'll get over me. 
SISKO: Maybe. 
JENNIFER: I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. 
SISKO: For any of us. 
(Doorbell) 
JENNIFER: Come in? 
O'BRIEN: I just got word. The Alliance fleet is less than eight hours away. I guess we've run out of time. 
[Engine room] 
SISKO: You concentrate on getting the weapons array online. I'll calibrate the SIF generators. 
O'BRIEN: Eight hours. It's not a lot of time, is it? 
SISKO: It's all we have. 
BASHIR: Smiley! Your assembly crew won't let me into the torpedo bay. 
O'BRIEN: That's because they're trying to get the torpedo chambering mechanism online. 
BASHIR: Great. So what am I supposed to do with these torpedoes? 
O'BRIEN: I have a few suggestions. 
BASHIR: Do you now? 
DAX: This isn't getting us anywhere. We need to buy ourselves some more time. 
SISKO: Any ideas? 
BASHIR: How many raiders have we got left? 
O'BRIEN: Only one. There's no way we can stop the Alliance attack. 
BASHIR: Maybe not, but I might be able to buy more time before they get here. 
O'BRIEN: You'll never make it back. 
BASHIR: Is that what you're worried about? I thought it was because I was going to reap all the glory. 
O'BRIEN: What good is glory when you're dead? 
BASHIR: Who said anything about dying? 
DAX: When are we leaving? I never liked staying in one place for very long. 
BASHIR: Then it's settled. 
SISKO: Before you go, we'd better make damn sure you can get us that extra time. 
[Holding cell] 
KIRA: Me help you fight the Alliance? What a perverse idea. I have a better one. Why don't I cut your throat? A quick death. Much less painful than anything the Regent will do to you. 
SISKO: I think you'd better worry about what the Regent is going to do to you. 
KIRA: The Regent has no reason to question my loyalty. 
SISKO: It's not your loyalty he'll be questioning. It's your effectiveness. After all, he wouldn't have to retake Terok Nor if you hadn't lost it in the first place. 
KIRA: I didn't lose anything. It was Garak and the rest of those Alliance fools with their excessive brutality. I could never make them to understand violence is a precision instrument. It's a scalpel, not a club. 
SISKO: Garak was smart enough to escape. 
KIRA: Garak is a coward. He ran at the first sign of danger. 
SISKO: Probably straight into the Regent's arms, where he no doubt laid the blame for the loss of this station entirely on you. 
KIRA: You have a point. 
SISKO: Good. Then I'll ask you again. Is there any weakness in the Alliance fleet? Something we can exploit? 
KIRA: It's a possibility. Why don't you lower this forcefield and join me in here? It might help stimulate my thought process. 
SISKO: I should think self-preservation would be stimulation enough for you. 
KIRA: That's not a very friendly attitude, especially when you want my help. Oh, it's Professor Sisko, isn't it. Well, she's very attractive but I've known Breen icicles that are warmer than she is. 
SISKO: This has nothing to do with her. 
KIRA: If you say so. Still, I've never been able to resist anyone named Benjamin Sisko. The Alliance ships are quick and powerful, but they do have one weakness. Their targeting systems can be fooled. They've been known to chase warp shadows. 
SISKO: How do I know I can believe you? 
KIRA: You're just going to have to trust me. 
[Klingon Bridge] 
(Garak is being thrown around.) 
WORF: The key. Where is it? 
GARAK: You're not listening, I didn't take the key. 
WORF: You are lying. 
KLINGON: I'm telling you. He stole it from me while I was feeding him. 
WORF: Don't make me ask you again. 
GARAK: What good would the key do me? Even if I were to unlock this collar, where could I go? I can't get off this ship. And besides, you've searched me three times already. Where could I possibly be hiding it? 
WORF: Perhaps you swallowed it. 
GARAK: Impossible. I'm very particular about what I eat. 
WORF: We will see about that. 
(Worf stabs Garak in the abdomen.) 
KLINGON: Regent! 
WORF: What is it? 
KLINGON: The key, sir. Somehow it fell into my boot. 
GARAK: Now do you believe me? 
WORF: (to Klingon) If he dies, you die. 
HELMSMAN: Six Rebel raiders are approaching, bearing three five four mark zero zero eight. Their sensors have detected us. They're fleeing. 
WORF: Wise choice. But they will not get far. 
[Rebel raider] 
(Basically, a runabout) 
DAX: I hope these warp shadows we're emitting are going to fool them. 
BASHIR: Well, we'll know as soon as they start firing. 
(The little ship dodges the torpedo blasts.) 
[Defiant conduit junction] 
JENNIFER: You look like you could use another pair of hands. 
SISKO: Smaller ones might help. 
JENNIFER: Here, let me. 
SISKO: I'm trying to calibrate the torque sensors. 
JENNIFER: Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? 
SISKO: Sorry. 
JENNIFER: For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. 
SISKO: And? 
JENNIFER: And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. 
SISKO: He has a forgiving nature. 
JENNIFER: It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. 
SISKO: He loved her very much. 
JENNIFER: No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. 
SISKO: When? 
JENNIFER: Right away. 
SISKO: What's Smiley going to say about that? 
JENNIFER: He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? 
SISKO: I'd better finish here. Tell Jake I'll see him soon. 
JENNIFER: Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? 
SISKO: I'm not sure it was real to begin with. 
JENNIFER: I'd better go get Jake home. 
[Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] 
(Yup, it's at that location again.) 
NOG: Hey! What are you doing there? 
JAKE: Nothing. I'm just thinking. 
NOG: Well, think somewhere else. You're making me uncomfortable. 
(Jake laughs.) 
NOG: What's so funny? 
JAKE: Where I come from, it's you and I that would hang out here, and it's your uncle that would chase us away. 
NOG: Am I suppose to be impressed by that? I don't care about some parallel universe. I only care about this one. And in this one, I run a bar and you do your thinking in your quarters. 
JAKE: All right, you made your point. 
NOG: I'm waiting. 
JAKE: I'm going. 
NOG: Good. You're a long way from home, human. 
JAKE: I guess I am. 
JENNIFER: Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. 
JAKE: Sure. 
[Holding area] 
KIRA: Tell me something. Are you as bored as I am? 
(The guard does not reply.) 
KIRA: I'll take that as a yes. You know, I bet if we put our heads together, we could create a little excitement for ourselves. 
GUARD: You sentenced my wife to death. 
KIRA: Isn't that a coincidence? I was hoping you weren't married. 
(Nog enters with a tray) 
NOG: I've prepared the Intendant's dinner. 
GUARD: Show me. 
(Nog hits the guard with the tray until he's out cold then takes his weapon to shoot the holding cell lock. ) 
KIRA: Nicely done. 
NOG: Thank you. I have a ship waiting for you at landing pad C. 
KIRA: I'm going to need that more than you will. I wasn't aware we were on the same side. 
NOG: You killed my father and my uncle. Thanks to you, I own the bar. 
[Defiant conduit junction] 
(BOOM. Klingon ships are strafing the station.) 
[Defiant Bridge] 
(BOOM) 
O'BRIEN: Jettison the docking scaffold. Captain. I think it's time for you to go. I believe that was the agreement. 
SISKO: I'm on my way. I just wanted to wish you luck. 
O'BRIEN: Thanks. You've given us a fine ship. I only wish I could have gotten to know her before taking her into battle. Still, there's nothing like a little on the job training to get the adrenalin pumping. 
(Sisko rolls his eyes and turns back from the door.) 
SISKO: Get out of that chair, Smiley. 
O'BRIEN: What do you mean? 
SISKO: Just do it. Seal the airlock, release docking clamps. Aft thrusters at one quarter impulse. What are you standing there for, Smiley? 
O'BRIEN: Captain, you never cease to amaze me. 
SISKO: Sometimes I even surprise myself. 
(BOOM) 
SISKO: How long do you think the station's shields can withstand the Alliance assault? 
O'BRIEN: Long enough for us to see just how tough this ship of yours really is. 
SISKO: Let's find out. Take us out of here. 
[Terok Nor Corridor] 
NOG: You're sure you want to leave now? 
KIRA: I'm hoping this new rebel ship keeps the Alliance busy while I get to Bajor. I have friends there who'll hide me. 
NOG: Well, don't worry, about me. I won't tell anyone where you are. 
KIRA: Nog? 
(She shoots him) 
KIRA: You're right. You won't tell anyone. 
[Another Corridor] 
JAKE: I don't see why you can't come to Deep Space Nine with me. 
JENNIFER: Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. 
(And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) 
KIRA: Jennifer. You look as beautiful as ever. 
[Defiant Bridge] 
(The Klingons are still concentrating on the station when one goes KaBOOM and the Defiant flies through the resulting fireball. Then they chase after another.) 
O'BRIEN: A bird of prey has locked onto us. 
SISKO: Evasive manoeuvres. Pattern Delta. 
(BOOM) 
O'BRIEN: Pattern Delta? What's that? 
SISKO: Rock her. 
O'BRIEN: Rock her? 
SISKO: Port to starboard, hard. 
O'BRIEN: Got it. Can't lose her. 
SISKO: Hard to port. 
(They dodge round a pylon and get behind the bigger ship.) 
SISKO: Fire! 
(KaBOOM!) 
O'BRIEN: I must remember that one. 
[Terok Nor Corridor] 
(Jennifer and Jake have been taken prisoner.) 
KIRA: You know, I really have to thank you, Jennifer. Not only do you guarantee me safe passage off the station, but you'll make the perfect gift for the Regent as well. 
JENNIFER: You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. 
KIRA: Why is he so important to you? 
JENNIFER: That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. 
KIRA: I've never seen you so passionate. It gives you a lovely glow. All right, he doesn't have to come. 
(Kira makes to shoot Jake.) 
JENNIFER: No! 
(Jennifer is shot instead.) 
KIRA: Now that was unfortunate. 
JAKE: She needs a doctor. 
KIRA: I'm afraid it's too late. For both of you. Just out of curiosity, why was she protecting you? 
JAKE: She's my mother. 
KIRA: Your mother? You're Sisko's son. From the other side? Well, in that case, give your father a message from me. Tell him I spared your life. That's a debt I intend to collect. 
[Defiant Bridge] 
O'BRIEN: Shields are down to forty percent. That cruiser has us in weapons' range. Do we make a run for it? 
SISKO: We run all right. Right at it. 
O'BRIEN: Ah. Pattern Suicide. 
[Klingon Bridge] 
WORF: Concentrate your fire on that ship. 
HELMSMAN: It's changing course. It's headed directly toward us. 
WORF: Good. That should make things easier. Terok Nor will soon be ours again. Then you can spend the rest of your life contemplating your failure as you labour alongside the other slaves in the ore processing centre. 
GARAK: It's nice to have something to look forward to. 
[Defiant Bridge] 
O'BRIEN: Shields down to twenty-five percent. One more hit could finish us. 
SISKO: Then we'll have to make sure we don't get hit. I'll take the helm. Nothing personal, I just know this ship better than you do. 
O'BRIEN: She's all yours. 
SISKO: Hold on. 
(Defiant skims along the massive ship's underside, firing and causing damage.) 
[Klingon Bridge] 
(Consoles are exploding.) 
WORF: I want that ship destroyed now! 
HELMSMAN: They're flying too close. I can't target them. 
[Defiant Bridge] 
O'BRIEN: We put a hole in their forward shields. 
SISKO: Nice shooting, Smiley. 
O'BRIEN: Hold on. A bird of prey just locked on to us. 
SISKO: Secondary power to aft shields. 
O'BRIEN: What secondary power? You've got to get us out of here. 
SISKO: We can't risk giving the cruiser a clear shot. 
O'BRIEN: I was just starting to like this ship. 
(KaBOOM - the attacking Klingon has been taken out by) 
[Rebel raider] 
BASHIR: Yeah! Bashir to Defiant. Aren't you going to welcome me back? 
[Defiant Bridge] 
O'BRIEN: I never thought I'd be happy to hear your voice. 
[Rebel raider] 
DAX: You'll get over it. 
SISKO [OC]: Sisko to Bashir. 
[Defiant Bridge] 
SISKO: Concentrate your fire on their forward shields. 
BASHIR [OC]: With pleasure. 
[Klingon Bridge] 
(Girders are coming down, knocking out the crew.) 
GARAK: Forgive me, my Regent, but perhaps the moment has arrived to remove your august presence from the battlefield. 
WORF: You mean retreat? 
GARAK: I hope I'm not out of line? 
[Defiant Bridge] 
O'BRIEN: The cruiser's changing course. They're going to warp. 
[Defiant Bridge] 
O'BRIEN: The other Alliance ships have broken off their attack on the station. We've won. 
SISKO: You sound surprised. 
O'BRIEN: Surprised? I'm astonished. Not that I'm complaining. 
[Klingon Bridge] 
WORF: I have been betrayed! There can be no other explanation for my defeat. 
GARAK: I certainly can't think of any. 
WORF: The traitor must be found and punished. 
GARAK: She will. It is the Intendant we're talking about, isn't it? 
WORF: The Intendant. Of course. 
GARAK: All I ask is that when the moment comes, that you allow me, your humble servant, the honour of administering her punishment. I promise you, she will regret her disloyalty before she dies. 
WORF: And while you dispose of the Intendant, I will dispose of the rebels. Make it so! 
[Terok Nor Infirmary] 
JAKE: Dad. See, I told you he'd come. 
SISKO: How is she? 
(Jake shakes his head. Sisko goes over to Jennifer's bed.) 
JENNIFER: Ben. 
SISKO: Easy. 
(He holds her hand.) 
JENNIFER: I knew we were still connected. 
SISKO: Always. 
(Jennifer dies.) 
JAKE: Dad. 
(Father and son hold each other in grief.) 
SISKO: Let's go home.
