Penumbra
[Sisko's quarters] 
(We're looking at a picture of a pastoral landscape with some woodland and gently rolling hills.) 
SISKO: There are a few wild moba trees here, and a creek that runs through the meadows and into the forest. 
(Sisko is showing the picture to Kasidy.) 
SISKO: Nice spot, huh? 
KASIDY: Bajor, right? 
SISKO: The Kendra province, just south of the Yolja river. I was there the other day. 
KASIDY: I thought you went to a conference in Rakantha. 
SISKO: I did. But afterwards Vedek Oram wanted me to visit his monastery. We took a transport across the mountains. The sun was just going down and the entire valley was shimmering in the light. And I said to myself, this is the place. This is where I'm going to build my house. 
KASIDY: I've heard you talk that way before. 
SISKO: Oh, no, this is not just talk. As of this morning, all of this land belongs to me. 
KASIDY: You're serious. 
SISKO: Twelve hecapates. I'm going to start building as soon as the war is over. We'll have a place that we can visit any time we want. 
KASIDY: Sounds good to me. 
SISKO: Maybe someday I'll retire here. 
KASIDY: I could see you now, sitting in your rocking chair, watching the sunset over the mountains every night, wondering where you put your teeth. 
SISKO: Just like my great-great grandfather, in the glass next to the chair. 
KASIDY: It's funny how thing's turn out, isn't it? 
SISKO: What do you mean? 
KASIDY: Did you ever think that you would become so attached to Bajor that you'd want to spend the rest of your life there? 
SISKO: It wasn't part of the master plan, if that's what you mean. But from the moment I set foot on this station, nothing has turned out the way I imagined it. This was supposed to be just a temporary assignment, but it has become much more than that. I guess I was meant to come here. You see, it's almost like my 
KASIDY: Destiny. 
SISKO: Destiny, yes. 
KASIDY: I guess when your mother turns out to be part prophet or part wormhole alien or whatever it is you want to call her, words like destiny begin to mean something. 
SISKO: When I look at the picture of this woman with my father, I think to myself, yes, that's Sarah, my mother. But she's not just a woman, she's more than that. And when I look at myself in the mirror 
KASIDY: You don't just see a man. You see more than that. 
SISKO: Does it bother you? 
KASIDY: Do I act like it bothers me? 
SISKO: You're not answering my question. 
KASIDY: I guess when you first told me about Sarah, I was a little surprised. 
SISKO: More than a little. 
KASIDY: All right, I was very surprised. But the more I thought about it, the more I realised what an amazing thing it was. Is. 
SISKO: I'm glad you think so. 
KASIDY: I do. And, part prophet or not, you're still my Benjamin and I love you. 
[Replimat] 
EZRI: I bumped into Captain Boday the other night. 
O'BRIEN: Captain Boday? 
BASHIR: The Gallamite. Jadzia dated him. 
O'BRIEN: Oh. The toothy smile and the transparent skull? 
BASHIR: That's him. 
O'BRIEN: What's he doing on the station? 
EZRI: The Gallamites are supplying duranium for the war effort. 
BASHIR: Personally, I don't know what Jadzia ever saw in that man. 
O'BRIEN: Well, his brains. 
BASHIR: Did he know who you were? 
EZRI: Not at first. 
BASHIR: But when he found out, I bet he laid on the charm. 
EZRI: You could say that. 
BASHIR: The man's insufferable. He's opinionated and arrogant. 
EZRI: And charming. 
BASHIR: If you say so. 
(Kira enters.) 
O'BRIEN: Something wrong? 
KIRA: We just got word from the Klingons. The Rotarran and the Koraga were ambushed by a Dominion patrol near the Badlands. 
EZRI: Worf was commanding the Koraga. 
KIRA: It didn't make it. The Rotarran recovered six escape pods. Worf wasn't aboard any of them. 
[Quark's] 
QUARK: Heard anything from the Defiant? 
EZRI: I talked to Benjamin this morning. He said that according to the Koraga's crew, Worf was the last one to leave the bridge. No one knows if he made it to the escape pod. 
QUARK: My money says he did. We haven't seen the last of that crazy Klingon. 
EZRI: They've been searching for three days. 
QUARK: They'll find him. It's just going to take a while. You know what it's like in the Badlands, there's a lot of sensor interference. 
EZRI: I should have gone with them. 
QUARK: And what would you be able to do that they can't? 
EZRI: Probably nothing, but it would be easier than just sitting here waiting. 
QUARK: He'll be back before you know it. 
EZRI: You really think so? 
QUARK: Absolutely. The night before he went on patrol, he brought the Koraga's crew in here and bought them three barrels of bloodwine. 
EZRI: And? 
QUARK: And he didn't pay the tab. Do you really think he'd go to Sto'Vo'Kor owing me money? 
EZRI: He doesn't even like you. 
QUARK: Exactly. He couldn't enjoy the afterlife knowing I had something on him. 
EZRI: Thanks, Quark. 
[Ezri's bedroom] 
(Ezri can't sleep) 
CREWMAN [OC]: Ops to Lieutenant Dax. 
EZRI: Go ahead. 
CREWMAN [OC]: You have an incoming transmission from the Defiant. 
EZRI: Patch it through. What is it, Benjamin? 
SISKO [on monitor]: I'm afraid we're going to have to call off the search. 
EZRI: You're giving up? 
SISKO [on monitor]: We don't have any choice. There are a dozen Jem'Hadar ships closing on our position. 
EZRI: But what if he's out there somewhere? 
SISKO [on monitor]: Let's face it, the odds aren't good. We don't even know if he made it off the Koraga. I'm sorry. 
[Dominion briefing room] 
DAMAR: The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. 
WEYOUN: No. Divert them to the So'na outpost on Devos Two. 
DAMAR: Why? 
WEYOUN: We need their to help protect the new Ketracel white facility. The Federation has been made aware of its location. 
DAMAR: Can't the So'na protect it? 
WEYOUN: Are you questioning my orders? That would be foolish. I wonder what the Defiant was doing out there? 
DAMAR: Looking for survivors from the Koraga. 
WEYOUN: For that long? 
DAMAR: Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. 
WEYOUN: If you have something to say, Damar, say it. 
DAMAR: Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. 
WEYOUN: Their sacrifices won't be in vain. We will be victorious. 
(Damar knocks back a large glass of kanar.) 
WEYOUN: A bit early, isn't it? Even for you. 
DAMAR: Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. 
WEYOUN: The Founder prefers it that way. 
DAMAR: I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. 
WEYOUN: Feel free to dress warmly. 
DAMAR: I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. 
WEYOUN: How can a god be ill? 
DAMAR: Maybe she's not a god. 
WEYOUN: Whether you believe the Founders are gods or not is irrelevant. All they require from you is obedience. Now. The Founder wants a subspace comm. link installed in her quarters. 
DAMAR: I'll see to it. 
WEYOUN: A secure channel, separately encoded and isolated from the main communication array. 
DAMAR: Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? 
WEYOUN: That doesn't concern you. 
(Weyoun leaves.) 
DAMAR: No, of course it doesn't. 
[Corridor] 
(Outside Worf's quarters.) 
EZRI: Computer, override locking mechanism. 
COMPUTER: Authorisation? 
EZRI: Authorisation Dax nine seven four alpha three. 
COMPUTER: Confirmed. 
[Worf's quarters] 
(The room is full of memories. Ezri hears words as she looks at the items.) 
WORF [OC]: This bat'leth belonged to my father. I would like you to have it, Jadzia. Go. I will take care of Yoshi. 
JADZIA [OC]: Worf, that's very sweet, but let's face it, you're not good with babies. 
WORF [OC]: I am a Klingon warrior. I have stood in battle against Kelvans twice my size. I courted and won the heart of the magnificent Jadzia Dax. If I can do these things, I can make this child go to sleep. You come first. Before career, before duty, before anything. 
JADZIA [OC]: I love you. 
WORF [OC]: And I love you. 
JADZIA [OC]: Worf, we may never see each other again. But before you leave, I want you to know that the answer is yes. 
WORF: Yes? Yes to what? 
JADZIA: Yes, I will marry you. 
[Worf's bedroom] 
WORF [OC]: You must go to Sirella and beg her forgiveness. 
JADZIA [OC]: I don't beg. 
SIRELLA [OC]: Jadzia, daughter of Kela, does your heart beat only for this man? 
JADZIA [OC]: Yes. 
SIRELLA [OC]: And do you swear to join with him and stand with him against all who would oppose you? 
JADZIA [OC]: I swear. 
SIRELLA [OC]: And do you swear to join with him and stand with him against all who would oppose you? 
EZRI: I swear. 
[Airlock] 
(The Defiant has docked.) 
SISKO: Colonel. 
KIRA: Captain, we have a problem. It's Ezri. She's gone. 
SISKO: Gone? 
KIRA: There's a runabout missing. 
O'BRIEN: She must've gotten it into her head to go looking for Worf. 
BASHIR: What could she be thinking? 
SISKO: She's a Dax. Sometimes they don't think. They just do. 
[Runabout Ganda] 
EZRI: I'm not spacesick, I'm not spacesick, I'm not. 
(beep) 
EZRI: Uh oh. 
SISKO [OC]: Sisko to Ganda. Ganda, respond. 
EZRI: Ganda here. Tshh. I'm not reading you very well. There's tshh interference. 
[Ops] 
SISKO: Dax, turn that ship around and get back here. 
[Runabout Ganda] 
EZRI: What was that, Benjamin? 
[Ops] 
EZRI [OC]: Tshh. 
SISKO: Cut it out, old man. I'm not buying it. 
EZRI [OC]: Tshh. Tshh. 
SISKO: I gave you an order, Lieutenant. 
[Runabout Ganda] 
EZRI: Don't worry, sir. I'll find him. 
[Ops] 
KIRA: We can send the Defiant to bring her back. 
SISKO: No. Let her go. 
KIRA: Captain? 
SISKO: Send her a copy of the Defiant's sensor logs. There's no sense in her searching the area we did. 
KIRA: Aye, sir. 
ODO: Sir, do you think there's any chance she'll be able to find him? 
SISKO: I wish I could say yes. 
ODO: Then may I ask why you're letting her do this? 
SISKO: Because she needs to. And because she'd never forgive me if I stopped her. 
[Runabout Ganda] 
EZRI: Computer, show me the position of the Koraga at the time it was attacked. 
(Tactical simulation 0199) 
EZRI: Which escape pods were recovered? 
COMPUTER: The six starboard pods were recovered. 
EZRI: Why none from the port side? 
COMPUTER: Unknown. 
EZRI: Assuming someone made it to the port escape pod closest to the bridge, calculate its trajectory. Computer, take us to the coordinates where it would have entered the Badlands. 
COMPUTER: Acknowledged. 
(Into the plasma fields.) 
EZRI: Computer, cut all engines. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Without manoeuvring thrusters, the ship may be swept into areas of plasma flare activity. 
EZRI: I know. But with any luck, the currents will take us to the same place they took Worf. Cut the engines. 
(And the tides take her along, looking faintly green around the gills.) 
[Sisko's quarters] 
(Sisko is building a model house.) 
KASIDY: Ben, what are you doing up? 
SISKO: I couldn't sleep. 
KASIDY: Oh, it's coming along. 
SISKO: I thought if I did some work, it'd take my mind off things. 
KASIDY: If Worf is out there, she'll find him. 
SISKO: So, what do you think? 
KASIDY: It's going to be beautiful. 
SISKO: These windows face south, toward the valley. 
KASIDY: It'll be a nice view. 
SISKO: Did you know there's a running stream on the property, and the soil is perfect for growing kava. I could make my own springwine. 
KASIDY: The Emissary's Special Reserve. Could be a big seller. 
SISKO: I can't decide whether I should open up this wall or keep the kitchen separate. 
KASIDY: Open it up. Who wants to be locked away cooking when you've got guests over? 
SISKO: A man needs to concentrate in the kitchen. You can't have people coming in and sticking their fingers in your pots. 
KASIDY: It's your house. 
SISKO: I want it to be our house. Let's get married. 
KASIDY: Do you mean it? 
SISKO: I love you. 
(Kisses.) 
SISKO: Does that mean yes? 
KASIDY: What do you think? 
SISKO: If you want to play hard to get. Ah ha. 
(He finds a rubber grommet and slides it on her finger.) 
KASIDY: What a beautiful ring. 
SISKO: Kasidy Yates, will you marry me? 
KASIDY: Yes. Yes, Mister Sisko. I will. 
[Runabout Ganda] 
(Still tumbling through the Badlands rapids, still one very nauseous pilot.) 
COMPUTER: Warning. Plasma flow activity ahead. 
(Red alert) 
EZRI: You're not kidding. 
COMPUTER: Re establishing engine control is recommended. 
EZRI: No, let's sit tight. Our only hope of finding that escape pod is to follow the currents. Transfer all available power to the shields. 
COMPUTER: Acknowledged. 
(The runabout touches a flare and gets thrown around. Then she sees something else artificial out there.) 
EZRI: Computer, hold position. Activate a tractor beam and lock onto that pod. 
(She beams Worf aboard. He's sitting on the floor.) 
EZRI: Worf. 
WORF: Ezri. 
EZRI: You're hurt. 
WORF: It is nothing. 
(Ezri helps him over to the co-pilot's seat.) 
WORF: You are alone. 
EZRI: The Defiant was forced to call off its search because of the Jem'Hadar. 
WORF: Why would Captain Sisko risk sending a runabout to look for me? 
EZRI: He didn't. I came without his permission. You're a fellow officer. I would've done the same for Kira or Julian. 
WORF: Of course. 
(Ezri bends close to dab at the wound on his brow. Too close.) 
WORF: I will do it myself. 
EZRI: I'll contact the station and tell them we're on our way back. 
[Founder's quarters] 
(The female shape-shifter is very wrinkled and flaking badly.) 
WEYOUN: Founder, it is an honour to be summoned to your presence. I trust the new communications system meets your needs? 
FOUNDER: It's adequate. 
WEYOUN: I'm glad. If I can be of any further assistance. 
FOUNDER: When the time comes. The vaccine. How is it progressing? 
WEYOUN: I regret that it failed to stabilise the latest sample you provided. 
FOUNDER: I see. 
WEYOUN: I have a team of Vorta doctors working night and day to find a cure. 
FOUNDER: Have them document their efforts and then eliminate them. 
WEYOUN: Founder? 
FOUNDER: Activate their clones and order them to continue their predecessors' work. Perhaps a fresh perspective will speed matters along. 
WEYOUN: Of course. 
FOUNDER: The Cardassians. What have you told them? 
WEYOUN: They know nothing. 
FOUNDER: Good. The sickness that has infected the Great Link is none of their concern. They may be our allies, but they are not to be trusted. We must not show weakness. 
WEYOUN: This unfortunate malady will soon be behind us. I won't rest until a cure is found. 
FOUNDER: See that you don't. 
WEYOUN: We'll require another sample. 
FOUNDER: Very well. 
(She peels a piece of skin from her face. It turns to blue gunk in the vial.) 
FOUNDER: You may go now. 
[Promenade] 
SISKO: So you approve? 
JAKE: Approve? I'm the one who set you up with Kasidy in the first place. 
SISKO: Yes, so you did. 
JAKE: Practically had to twist your arm. A freighter captain? You want me to go out with a freighter captain? 
SISKO: Ah, well, you have to admit, the job description conjures up a certain image. 
JAKE: You shouldn't have doubted me. I knew from the first time I met her that she was the woman for you. 
SISKO: If you're going to take credit, you're also going to have to take on responsibilities. 
JAKE: Like what? 
SISKO: Like being my best man. 
JAKE: Are you serious? 
SISKO: Absolutely. 
JAKE: I mean, are you sure you don't want to ask Grandpa or Dax? 
SISKO: No. No. So what do you say? 
JAKE: I'm honoured. Best man, huh? 
SISKO: Yes. 
JAKE: That means I get to plan the bachelor party. 
[Runabout Ganda] 
EZRI: What are you doing? 
WORF: I am realigning the inertial stabilisers. 
EZRI: But didn't you just do that a few hours ago? 
WORF: I want to make sure the systems are running at optimal efficiency. 
EZRI: Right. So, what was it like being in that escape pod for so long? 
WORF: Quiet. 
EZRI: What'd you do to spend the time? 
WORF: Nothing. 
EZRI: Nothing? I bet the acoustics in there were pretty good. What'd you sing? Klingon opera? 
WORF: I did not sing. 
EZRI: Which one? Shevok'tah gish? 
WORF: No. Gav'ot toh'va. 
EZRI: Ambitious. The solos are for a tenor. 
WORF: As you said, the acoustics were favourable. 
EZRI: I remember the first night that you played that for Jadzia. I'm sorry. 
WORF: No need to apologise. Though I would prefer we not discuss her. 
EZRI: I understand. What about Alexander? 
WORF: What about him? 
EZRI: Is it all right if I ask about the son of Worf? I hear he's been made Weapons Officer of the Ya'Vang. 
WORF: They were shorthanded. 
EZRI: You make it sound like he didn't deserve it. 
WORF: That was not my intention. 
EZRI: Are you ever going to ease up on him? 
WORF: My relationship with Alexander is not your concern. 
EZRI: That's funny, because on our wedding night you told me that. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned our wedding night. I mean, Jadzia's wedding night. This is ridiculous. We can't have a conversation if you refuse to talk about the things that we have in common. 
WORF: Perhaps we should not have a conversation. 
EZRI: You have been avoiding me for the past six months now. 
WORF: I did not ask you to come aboard the station. 
EZRI: I would have left, but you told me to stay! 
WORF: And I am beginning to regret it. 
EZRI: If it wasn't for me, you'd still be drifting around in an escape pod singing Klingon opera. 
(Red alert.) 
WORF: Sensors are detecting two ships closing on our position. 
EZRI: They're Jem'Hadar fighters. 
WORF: I'm dropping out of warp. 
EZRI: Is that a good idea? 
WORF: We cannot outrun them. The Goralis system is nearby. We might be able to lose them there. 
EZRI: They're coming in behind us. 
(Bang!) 
WORF: Transfer auxiliary power to aft shields. 
(Bang!) 
EZRI: Shields are down to thirty percent. 
WORF: I am taking us into the atmosphere. (Bang!) Their ships are not designed for sub-orbital flight. 
(Bang!) 
WORF: They are pulling away. 
EZRI: Glad to hear it, but that last hit took out our starboard thrusters. 
(Bang!) 
WORF: We are losing altitude. 
EZRI: I can't compensate. 
WORF: We must abandon ship. 
(They grab phaser rifles and rucksacks from the floor compartment.) 
WORF: Energise. 
[Planet surface] 
(The runabout burns up and explodes in the night sky.) 
EZRI: That was a good call. 
WORF: We may be here several days. I will reconnoiter the area. Set up a comm. link and try to contact the station. 
EZRI: Right. Where's the comm. unit? You didn't take one? 
WORF: I thought you did. 
EZRI: No. 
WORF: Now we have no way of contacting the station. 
EZRI: Thanks for spelling it out for me. Look on the bright side. We'll have plenty of time to talk. 
[Replimat] 
SISKO: No, I know. What do you say we have Bill Ross to perform the ceremony? 
KASIDY: My mother would prefer for her daughter to be married by a minister. But an Admiral's the next best thing. 
SISKO: That's good. I'll talk to him. 
KASIDY: About the guest list. I wanted to keep it small, just family and friends. 
SISKO: That's fine by me. There's only room for thirty or forty people in the wardroom. 
KASIDY: That just leaves the menu. 
SISKO: You mind if I ask Quark to do the catering? 
KASIDY: Just make sure he doesn't overcharge us. 
SISKO: I'll make sure I can cut a deal. Kasidy, what else do we need to talk about? I have the feeling we're forgetting something. 
KASIDY: You tell me. You're the one who's been married before. 
SISKO: That's just it. It felt a lot more complicated before. 
KASIDY: People get carried away with weddings. I just want it to be nice and simple. 
SAHGI: Excuse me, Emissary. 
SISKO: Hello, Sahgi. 
SAHGI: I wanted to congratulate both of you. 
KASIDY: Well, aren't you sweet. 
SISKO: Thank you. 
KASIDY: Who told you we were getting married? 
SAHGI: Everybody's talking about it. Can I be one of your dais bearers? 
KASIDY: My what, honey? 
SAHGI: For the bridal procession. I know you can only choose fifty one girls, but it would be such an honour for me. 
KASIDY: Well, er 
SAHGI: People are saying it's going to be the biggest wedding Bajor's ever seen. 
KASIDY: They are? 
SAHGI: The Emissary's getting married. 
KASIDY: Ben? 
SISKO: Kasidy, I think this is going to be a little more complicated than we thought. 
(A crowd is watching them from the Promenade.) 
[Damar's quarters] 
DAMAR: What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. 
(He's talking to a woman.) 
DAMAR: Still, power does have its privileges. 
(Dukat enters.) 
DAMAR: Dukat. 
DUKAT: Leave us. 
(Damar nods. The woman leaves.) 
DAMAR: Does Weyoun know you're here? 
DUKAT: I see he still has you under his thumb. 
DAMAR: My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. 
DUKAT: I may have failed to reopen the wormhole, but I assure you I have no regrets. You see, I've come to know the love of the Pah wraiths. 
DAMAR: You almost sound as if you believe it. 
DUKAT: I do. 
DAMAR: What brings you here? 
DUKAT: I've come to see you, old friend. I need your help. 
DAMAR: I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. 
DUKAT: Damar. 
DAMAR: But I'll do what I can. 
DUKAT: I knew you would. 
[Planet surface] 
(They've built a camp fire. Ezri is trying to make a comm. unit from a tricorder and her badge when Worf comes in with a dead animal over his shoulder.) 
WORF: Dinner. 
EZRI: Why'd you have to kill a defenceless animal. We have plenty of field rations. 
WORF: I have been eating field rations for six days. I am sick of field rations. 
EZRI: So you traipsed off into the jungle and phasered yourself something to eat. 
WORF: I did not use a phaser. I used this. (a pointed stick.) 
EZRI: Oh, well that makes it all the more sporting. 
WORF: It took me hours to track this animal. And while doing so, I could have easily been attacked by a predator myself. 
EZRI: Oh, spare me the one with nature speech. 
WORF: I killed it and now I am going to eat it. If you do not want any, then have some more field rations. 
EZRI: Fine. 
WORF: Jadzia would have understood. 
EZRI: Oh, I thought we weren't supposed to talk about her. 
WORF: I was merely making an observation. Have you been able to boost the comm. badge signal? 
EZRI: Not enough to get a message back to the station. I'll bet Jadzia would've been able to do it. I was merely making an observation. 
WORF: Perhaps we should both refrain from making observations. 
EZRI: You're right. Let's just go about our business and exchange as few words as possible. What is it about men? They either don't talk at all, like you, or they talk too much, like Boday. 
WORF: Boday? The Gallamite? 
EZRI: We had dinner on the station before I left. 
WORF: I see. If he talks so much, why would you have dinner with him? 
EZRI: He's interesting. And he's got a good sense of humour. 
WORF: Tell me. Did Jadzia, did she and Boday? 
EZRI: I don't have to answer that question. 
WORF: She did. 
EZRI: Worf, she didn't even know you back then. 
WORF: I do not wish to hear your excuses. 
EZRI: My excuses? I'm not the one who slept with him. 
WORF: You had dinner with him. 
EZRI: Who are you angry with? Me or Jadzia? 
WORF: Both. 
EZRI: You know what? You're crazy. 
WORF: You could make anyone crazy. 
EZRI: Don't turn your back. Talk to me, you coward. 
WORF: Do not call me a coward. 
EZRI: I can't believe I'm stuck here with you. 
WORF: Perhaps you would rather be on the station with Captain Boday, you sli'vak. 
(Ezri swings at him, he grabs her arm and kisses her.) 
(Later, they are curled up together by the embers of the fire when footsteps alert them. Two Breen stun them.) 
[Breen cell] 
(Worf wakes up first.) 
WORF: Ezri? 
EZRI: Where are we? 
WORF: I am not certain. 
(He can't open the door.) 
WORF: Why would the Breen take us prisoner? We are not at war with them. 
EZRI: What were they doing on Goralis? That's a long way from Breen space. Ow. 
(Her shoulder hurts. Worf massages it.) 
WORF: You must have gotten hurt when they stunned us. 
EZRI: Actually, I think it happened last night. 
WORF: You do not regret what happened last night, do you? 
EZRI: Why do you say that? 
WORF: Jadzia explained to me that joined Trill are not supposed to become involved with anyone they were intimate with in a previous life. 
EZRI: I bet you've broken a few Klingon rules in your time. 
(The room shudders.) 
EZRI: What's that? 
WORF: We must be on a Breen ship. 
[Dominion briefing room] 
WEYOUN: The Federation has pulled the Sixth Fleet from the Bolian front. What do you suppose they're planning? Damar. 
DAMAR: Yes? 
WEYOUN: What's wrong with you? You're distracted. 
DAMAR: Am I? 
WEYOUN: You've been pacing back and forth all morning. 
DAMAR: Just trying to keep warm. 
CARDASSIAN [OC]: Legate Damar, please report to your quarters. 
DAMAR: Acknowledged. Excuse me. 
WEYOUN: If you think I don't know what you're up to, you're a bigger fool than Dukat. 
DAMAR: Dukat? 
WEYOUN: He used to entertain lady friends as well. 
DAMAR: Guilty as charged. 
[Damar's quarters] 
(Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) 
DUKAT: That surgeon you recommended does excellent work. What do you think? 
DAMAR: Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. 
DUKAT: Believe me, Damar, I have no desire to be a Bajoran the rest of my life. But for now, I'm afraid it's necessary. 
[Sisko's quarters] 
SISKO [OC]: Personal log, stardate 52576.2. Dax and Worf are four days overdue. Dominion activity at their last known position has prevented us from sending a search team. For the time being, there's nothing to do but wait and hope that they're all right. 
(The model house continues apace. Suddenly we go into Prophet Limbo and then) 
[Promenade] 
SISKO: Why have you brought me here? Show yourselves. 
SARAH: You are the Sisko. 
SISKO: Sarah? 
SARAH: You must accept your destiny. 
[Corridor] 
SARAH: Your path is a difficult one. She can not share it with you. 
SISKO: Are you talking about Kasidy? 
SARAH: She cannot walk the same path. 
SISKO: You don't understand. I love her. We're going to be married. 
[Ops] 
SARAH: That is not your destiny. 
SISKO: My destiny is my own. I'm a man. I have the right to live my life without your interference. 
SARAH: I gave you life. 
SISKO: Sarah Sisko was my mother, not you. 
SARAH: I shared her existence, guided her to your father. So that you would be born. 
[Ready room] 
SARAH: You must walk the path alone. 
SISKO: You're not listening to me. I want to spend my life with her. 
SARAH: If you do, you will know nothing but sorrow. 
SISKO: You don't care about how I feel. All that matters to you is that I do what you want. 
[Promenade] 
SARAH: You are the Sisko. You are part of me. 
SISKO: If that's true, if you really do care about me, if you consider me your son, then let me have this. 
SARAH: It is not for you to have. There are many tasks still ahead of you. Accept your fate. Your greatest trial is about to begin. Don't be afraid. 
(She touches his face.) 
SARAH: All will be as it should be. 
SISKO: Mother. 
SARAH: Stay on the path, Benjamin. 
[Sisko's quarters] 
(And he comes out of the vision.)
