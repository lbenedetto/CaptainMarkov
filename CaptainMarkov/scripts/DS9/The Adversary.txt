The Adversary
Commander's log, stardate 48959.1. It is with mixed emotions that I record this, my final Commander's log. The last three years have been the most demanding and rewarding of my career. I can only hope that the future will hold even greater challenges. 
[Wardroom] 
JAKE: Dad, there's something I've been wanting to say to you for a long time. And now that I finally have the chance, I'm going to make it short and simple. 
(Jake puts another pip onto Sisko's collar) 
JAKE: Congratulations, Captain Sisko. 
KIRA: Now that you have another pip on your collar, does that mean I can't disagree with you anymore? 
SISKO: No. It just means I'm never wrong. 
KIRA: We'll see about that. 
DAX: Curzon would've been proud of you, but not as proud as I am. 
SISKO: That means a lot to me, Dax. 
ODO: Though I don't fully understand this humanoid obsession with rank and title, if anyone deserves to be promoted, it's you. 
SISKO: Thank you, Constable. 
EDDINGTON: Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. 
O'BRIEN: That goes for me too, Captain. 
QUARK: This calls for a toast. 
BASHIR: That better not be from a replicator, Quark. 
QUARK: Chateau Cleon, twenty three oh three. I already put it on your account. 
JAKE: Can I? 
SISKO: I guess a sip wouldn't hurt. Well. 
O'BRIEN: Here's to the newest and best captain in Starfleet. And all I can say is, it's about time. 
ALL: Hear, hear. Cheers. 
(Sisko takes Jake's champagne glass from him.) 
SISKO: That's enough. Thank you for coming, Ambassador. 
KRAJENSKY: Those pips look good on you, Captain. Though to be honest, I'm not really here for the ceremony. 
SISKO: I had that feeling. What can I do for you? 
KRAJENSKY: Our intelligence reports indicate there's been a coup d'ï¿½tat on the Tzenkethi homeworld. 
SISKO: I doubt anyone is going to miss the Autarch. 
KRAJENSKY: I know I won't. Unfortunately, it's too early to tell who's in control, but we don't want to take any chances. We need to remind the Tzenkethi that the Federation is committed to protecting our colonies near their border. 
SISKO: You want to show the flag. 
KRAJENSKY: Exactly. The Defiant will leave in two days on a week-long patrol. I'll be coming along as an observer. I've heard a lot about the Defiant. I'm looking forward to seeing her in operation. 
SISKO: I don't think you'll be disappointed. She's a fine ship. 
KRAJENSKY: With a fine crew. Now what do you say we get back to the party? 
SISKO: Of course. 
O'BRIEN et al: For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny! 
O'BRIEN: Hip hip. 
ALL: Hooray! 
O'BRIEN: Hip hip. 
ALL: Hooray! 
O'BRIEN: Hip hip. 
ALL: Hooray! 
[Engine room] 
SISKO: I want a complete overhaul of the deflector shield generators and targeting sensors. Oh, yes, take on a full complement of photon torpedoes. 
O'BRIEN: Don't worry, Captain. If the Tzenkethi try to start any trouble, we'll be ready for them. 
SISKO: I don't doubt it, Chief. 
(Sisko leaves. O'Brien starts his work then hears a noise.) 
O'BRIEN: Captain? 
(Nothing and no one.) 
O'BRIEN: Getting jumpy in your old age, O'Brien. 
My son, the writer, thinks I should say something profound on his occasion. He even offered to write me a brief statement. I told him I'd take care of it myself, but as it turns out the only think I can think of is, Begin Captain's log, stardate 48960.9. 
[Turbolift] 
DAX: So, have you told her yet? 
SISKO: Told who? 
DAX: Captain Yates. About your promotion. 
SISKO: Yeah. I barely had time to send my father a transmission. In fact, I don't even know where Kasidy is. 
DAX: She's hauling a load of duridium ore to Solais Five. You could probably contact her on subspace. 
SISKO: I'd rather tell her in person. 
DAX: When's she due back on the station? 
SISKO: About a month. 
DAX: A month! 
[Corridor] 
DAX: There's nothing worse than a long-distance relationship. 
SISKO: I wouldn't call it a relationship, Dax. I've only taken her out once. Okay, twice. 
DAX: I think the exact figure is three times. 
SISKO: She's quite an interesting woman. She's very independent, a little opinionated, but she has a nice sense of humour. 
DAX: And? 
SISKO: And? What do you want me to tell you, Dax? 
DAX: That you miss her. That you can't wait to see her. I don't know. Anything. Kira, O'Brien, Bashir, they're all dying of curiosity and, well, I have to tell them something. 
SISKO: Fine. You tell them when she gets back, I'm going to taking her to the holosuite and we're going to watch the seventh game of the nineteen sixty four World Series. 
DAX: You do like her. 
[Bridge] 
EDDINGTON: Captain on the bridge. 
SISKO: Ambassador. 
KRAJENSKY: Captain. 
SISKO: All stations report. 
DAX: Helm ready. 
KIRA: Weapons ready. 
ODO: Communications systems standing by. 
O'BRIEN: Warp and impulse engines are online. 
SISKO: Seal the airlock. Release docking clamps. 
DAX: Docking clamps released. 
SISKO: Engage thrusters. 
DAX: Clearing the station. 
SISKO: Lay in a course for the Tzenkethi border, warp eight. 
DAX: Aye, aye, Captain. 
SISKO: Engage. 
[Jefferies tube] 
(O'Brien is working when he hears a thud.) 
O'BRIEN: Hello. Who's there? 
(No reply, so he goes to look. There's another thud. O'Brien looks behind him then) 
O'BRIEN: Julian! 
BASHIR: You called me, Chief? 
O'BRIEN: Why didn't you answer me? 
BASHIR: I had this spanner in my mouth. 
O'BRIEN: What are you doing here, anyway? 
BASHIR: I was connecting my new diagnostic console to the medical bay's power grid. 
O'BRIEN: I could have done that for you. 
BASHIR: Oh, just putting my engineering extension courses to work. Besides, I know you have your hands full. 
O'BRIEN: Oh. Where are you going now? 
BASHIR: I'm done. 
(Bashir crawls away, and O'Brien goes to check his handiwork) 
O'BRIEN: Not bad for an extension course. 
[Mess hall] 
EDDINGTON: You wanted to see me, sir? 
SISKO: Yes, Commander. It's about Ambassador Krajensky. Please. (they sit) I know Starfleet doesn't intend for this to be a combat mission, but just in case the Tzenkethi have other ideas, I want to make sure the Ambassador is kept out of harm's way. 
EDDINGTON: Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. 
SISKO: He won't like it. 
EDDINGTON: I won't let that bother me. 
SISKO: Very good, Commander. That'll be all. 
EDDINGTON: Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. 
SISKO: I appreciate the sentiment, Commander, but it doesn't really change anything. I have the assignment I want, I have the crew that I want. The rank doesn't make much difference. 
EDDINGTON: You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. 
SISKO: You could always transfer from Security to Command. 
EDDINGTON: Then who would protect the Ambassador? 
SISKO: Dismissed, Mister Eddington. 
EDDINGTON: Thank you, sir. 
Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. 
[Bridge] 
ODO: Captain, we're receiving a priority one distress signal from Barisa Prime. Audio only. 
SISKO: Put it through. 
MAN [OC]: under heavy fire from Tzenkethi warships. I don't know how much longer we can hold out. Can anyone hear me, This is 
SISKO: Constable? 
ODO: We've lost contact. 
SISKO: Try to re-establish. 
ODO: It's no use, Captain. They're gone. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We've been unable to re-establish contact with Barisa Prime. Therefore I've no choice but to assume we are at war with the Tzenkethi. 
[Bridge] 
SISKO: Lieutenant, set a course for Barisa Prime, maximum warp. I want continual scans for Tzenkethi ships. Constable, contact Starfleet Command. Let them know what happened. 
SISKO: Major, what other starships are in this sector? 
KIRA: The closest one is the Ulysses. They're studying protoplanetary masses in the Helaspont Nebula. 
SISKO: That puts them twenty hours away at maximum warp. Lieutenant, transmit a message to Captain Entebe on the Ulysses. Tell her 
ODO: Captain. I'm having trouble getting through to Starfleet Command. There seems to be a power fluctuation in the communications system. 
DAX: I can't get a message out either. 
O'BRIEN: The console's functioning normally. The problem must be in the transceiver assembly. 
SISKO: I need that system back online, Chief. 
O'BRIEN: I'll get on it right away. Lieutenant, I could use some help. 
SISKO: Major, take the helm. 
KIRA: Yes, sir. 
[Jefferies tube] 
(There are a load of extra cables behind a panel. One is growing to make a new connection as they look at it.) 
O'BRIEN: What do you make of this, Lieutenant? I've never seen anything like it. 
DAX: It's spreading through the system like some kind of parasite. 
O'BRIEN: It seems to be linked to key points within the transceiver assembly. We'd better get it out of there. 
(Zap!) 
O'BRIEN: Argh! 
DAX: A forcefield. 
O'BRIEN: Come on. 
DAX: Where are we going? 
O'BRIEN: I want to check the other command systems. I have a bad feeling about this. 
[Engine room] 
(And another one does the growing thing.) 
SISKO: You say these things are all over the ship? 
O'BRIEN: They've attached themselves to the command and communication relays, the internal sensors, the transporter, the deflector shield grid, almost every critical system. 
SISKO: Is there any way to get past the forcefields? 
O'BRIEN: None that we've found yet. We're still working on it. 
SISKO: Well I guess the question is, how did they get aboard? Or should I say, who placed them here? 
O'BRIEN: I don't know who did it, but I know it definitely happened after we left the station. I ran a systems check before our departure. They weren't there then. 
SISKO: Which means someone aboard this ship is a saboteur. 
DAX: We've got forty seven people on board. Theoretically, anyone of them could've planted those devices. 
SISKO: Chief? 
O'BRIEN: It's nothing, sir. It's not even worth mentioning. 
SISKO: It doesn't sound like you're too sure about that. 
O'BRIEN: Well, I did see someone crawling about in one of the Jefferies Tubes the other day. 
SISKO: Who? 
O'BRIEN: It was Julian. He was connecting a medical console to the power grid. 
SISKO: Which is right next to the communications relay. 
DAX: Are you accusing Julian of sabotage? 
SISKO: No one's accusing anyone of anything. But I want to talk to Julian. 
DAX: Wait. I think I have a better idea. 
[Bridge] 
SISKO: This crew has been through a lot together. In fact I would trust any one of you with my life. But after looking at the evidence, there's only one conclusion I can draw. Someone on this ship is guilty of sabotage. 
EDDINGTON: With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. 
SISKO: That won't be necessary. Lieutenant. 
DAX: We found one of the devices planted in the warp plasma conduit. Which means whoever put it there would've been exposed to trace amounts of tetryon particles. 
KRAJENSKY: And those particles would still be detectable on the saboteur? 
O'BRIEN: Yes, but not for much longer. They dissipate quickly. 
ODO: So you're going to scan all the members of the crew for tetryon particles? 
SISKO: Starting with the senior staff. 
DAX: O'Brien and I already scanned positive, since we opened up the warp core controls during our investigation. 
EDDINGTON: You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive 
O'BRIEN: We'll be the prime suspects. Yes, we know that. 
SISKO: We might as well get started. 
(Dax scans Sisko.) 
DAX: You're clean. 
SISKO: I'm glad to hear it. 
KIRA: Might as well do me next. 
DAX: You're okay, too. Julian. 
BASHIR: Oh, of course. 
(Eddington puts his hand on his phaser, just in case.) 
O'BRIEN: Nothing. 
BASHIR: You sound relieved. 
O'BRIEN: Well I am. After all, you were in that conduit the other day. 
BASHIR: I don't know what you're talking about. 
DAX: Ambassador, if you please. 
KRAJENSKY: Certainly. 
BASHIR: I was never in any conduit. 
O'BRIEN: Of course you were. I saw you. 
(Beep! And the Admiral morphs into a whirl of goo, and escapes through the ceiling.) 
KIRA: It's a changeling. 
SISKO: We've cloaked. Lieutenant, bring us out of warp. Full stop. Now. Constable, Commander, deploy security teams immediately. I want that changeling found before he can do any more damage. 
EDDINGTON: Yes, sir. 
(Odo and Eddington leave) 
DAX: Captain. The helm isn't responding. We're still at warp. 
O'BRIEN: I can't deactivate the cloaking device. 
KIRA: The weapons array has activated. The phaser banks are charging and we've got photon torpedoes online and ready to launch. 
DAX: The ship's no longer under our control. 
[Mess hall] 
EDDINGTON: Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. 
SISKO: Is there any way he could've been transported off the ship? 
EDDINGTON: At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. 
ODO: He's still here. He won't leave until he's completed his mission. 
BASHIR: Which is? 
SISKO: It looks like the Dominion is hoping to start a war between the Federation and the Tzenkethi. 
KIRA: If you ask me, the Tzenkethi are doing a pretty good job of that all by themselves. 
SISKO: Not necessarily. The transmission we received from Barisa Prime could've been faked using that device we found implanted in the communications relay. In fact, our entire mission could have been engineered by the Dominion. Think about it. We've been all over this ship, and we have not seen a trace of the real Ambassador Krajensky nor his remains. 
EDDINGTON: Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. 
ODO: Maybe the real Ambassador never came to Deep Space Nine at all. 
BASHIR: So anything Ambassador Krajensky told us could have been a lie. The Tzenkethi coup d'ï¿½tat, increased tension along the border, the threat of an attack. 
SISKO: And now here we are, cloaked, armed for battle, and headed into Tzenkethi space. If we can't stop this ship before we cross the border, we may wind up causing a war rather of preventing one. 
ODO: Which is no doubt what my people are hoping for. A war between the Tzenkethi and the Federation would destabilise the Alpha Quadrant, making it that much easier for the Dominion to move in. 
EDDINGTON: I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. 
ODO: I'm not sure the sensors would help. If you scan me when I'm a rock, you'd detect a rock. I may not be able to duplicate a humanoid perfectly, but I'm guessing he can. 
BASHIR: We scanned Ambassador Krajensky for tetryon particles. He registered as human. 
KIRA: Well then right now the changeling could be anything or anyone on this ship. 
SISKO: Then we have to narrow his options. Confine all nonessential personnel to their quarters and seal them in with forcefields. Doctor, I want you to review those tricorder readings. See if you can find anything that will help us find the changeling. And take some security with you. From here on, no one is to be left alone. 
(Bashir and Odo leave.) 
SISKO: We have seven hours before we enter Tzenkethi space. I want that changeling found before then. 
EDDINGTON: That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. 
[Corridor] 
(Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. 
ODO: Thank you for your cooperation. Hopefully this will be over soon and you'll be able to return to duty. 
(Forcefield is in place.) 
ODO: All right, let's go. 
[Sickbay] 
BASHIR: (to his escort) This may take a while. 
[Weapons locker] 
EDDINGTON: Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? 
ODO: I don't use them. Besides, in the history of my people, no changeling has ever harmed another. I'd hate to be the first. 
EDDINGTON: Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. 
ODO: You may be right. But I've been a security officer most of my humanoid existence. And in all that time, I've never found it necessary to fire a weapon or take a life. I don't intend to start now. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: This is O'Brien. I need a security team in the engine room immediately. 
[Engine room] 
(Dax is out cold and Bashir is examining her.) 
O'BRIEN: It must've been the changeling. I went down the hall to get an interphasic compensator. I heard a noise and when I came back 
BASHIR: She's got a severe concussion. Give me a hand. We've got to get her back to the medical bay immediately. 
(Odo holds back one security officer.) 
ODO: Stay here with the Chief. 
O'BRIEN: Damage control team, report to the engine room. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge] 
BASHIR: Dax is still unconscious. I've given her cortical analeptics to stabilise her condition. She should be all right in a day or two, but until then 
SISKO: Is there any way to speed up the process? 
BASHIR: I could use a neural stimulator but that might cause irreversible brain damage. I don't recommend it. 
SISKO: Then Chief O'Brien is going to have to regain control of the ship without her. 
BASHIR: I'm afraid so. I should get back to my patient. 
(Bashir and his shadow leave.) 
KIRA: The changeling's very clever. Taking out Dax makes O'Brien's job a lot harder. 
SISKO: One thing's for sure, we're not going to start a war with the Tzenkethi. If O'Brien can't regain control before we cross the border I'll have no choice but to destroy the Defiant. 
(Later, the crew are assembled, including a Bolian.) 
SISKO: Our objective is simple. Find the changeling and stop him before he can do any more damage. We'll break into two-person teams. Each team will be armed with phaser rifles. 
EDDINGTON: We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. 
ODO: Phasers have been set low enough to avoid damaging equipment, but high enough to affect the changeling. 
SISKO: The changeling could be hiding anywhere. He could look like anything. So we're going to have to systematically sweep the ship with phaser fire. Every conduit, every corridor. If he's out there, we'll find him. Any questions? 
BOLIAN: What if the changeling's not out there? What if he's one of us? 
SISKO: That's why everyone will be in teams. Keep your partner in sight at all times. 
KIRA: And if we see anyone without a partner? 
SISKO: Escort them to the brig. We don't want to take any chances. Let's go. 
[Corridor] 
(Phaser pulses are sent down a Jefferies tube.) 
KIRA: All right. Let's go. 
BOLIAN: After you. 
KIRA: Don't you trust me? 
BOLIAN: No, I don't. 
KIRA: I know exactly how you feel. Follow me. 
[Jefferies tube] 
(Eddington fires a shot along the tube ahead.) 
EDDINGTON: Don't you ever sweat? 
ODO: No, I don't. It's the modified phaser beam. It's heating up the air. 
EDDINGTON: You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? 
ODO: I wouldn't know. I'm not him. 
EDDINGTON: He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? 
ODO: I've thought about it, but the truth is I don't understand my people all that well. 
EDDINGTON: That's too bad. 
ODO: Yes, it is. 
EDDINGTON: For all of us. 
[Jefferies tube ladder] 
SISKO: Watch my back. 
(They climb down to a junction.) 
SISKO: Over there. On three. One, two 
(Security gets taken out by a tentacle and Sisko is knocked down as it escapes.) 
SISKO: This is Sisko. The changeling is in Jefferies tube seven A heading to the lower deck. I'm in pursuit. 
[Corridor] 
(The teams are converging. Sisko comes out of the tube and a phaser shot just misses his shoulder.) 
BOLIAN: The changeling. He's right over there. 
(Kira walks round the corner.) 
KIRA: Put your phaser down. It's me, Kira. We were on our way to meet you and we got separated for a second. The next thing I know, he opens fire. 
BOLIAN: You can't fool me. You're the changeling. I saw you come out of that hatch and go around the corner. 
KIRA: I didn't see anyone. Maybe he morphed into the ventilation system. Or maybe he didn't. For all we know, you may be the changeling. 
BOLIAN: Keep back! 
SISKO: Both of you put your weapons down now. 
BOLIAN: I can't do that, Captain. 
KIRA: You heard him. 
(Odo disarms the Bolian and hits him.) 
EDDINGTON: (comes in behind Kira) What happened? 
SISKO: How long have the two of you been apart? 
ODO: At least a minute. 
SISKO: Then we've got a problem. Any of us could be the changeling. You, Kira, Eddington, even me. 
ODO: Not you. 
SISKO: What do you mean? 
ODO: You're bleeding. 
SISKO: I cut my hand when the changeling attacked me. 
EDDINGTON: What are you getting at? 
ODO: When blood leaves a humanoid body it's still blood. But when any part of me separates from my body 
KIRA: It reverts back to a gelatinous state. 
SISKO: Sisko to Bashir. 
BASHIR [OC]: This is Bashir. 
SISKO: Doctor, meet us in the mess hall immediately. 
[Mess hall] 
BASHIR: This shouldn't take long. 
(Bashir takes a blood sample from the Bolian.) 
BOLIAN: Satisfied? 
SISKO: So far. 
BASHIR: Who's next? 
KIRA: I'll go. 
BASHIR: I'd say the Major is exactly who she appears to be. 
KIRA: Try not to look so surprised. 
BASHIR: There doesn't seem to be any point obtaining a sample from the Constable. I guess that leaves the three of us. 
EDDINGTON: Let's get this over with. 
(Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) 
KIRA: You'd better come with us. 
[Corridor] 
EDDINGTON: This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? 
ODO: Inside. 
EDDINGTON: You're making a mistake. 
KIRA: Do as he says. 
(Bang! The door opposite opens and the occupant shouts through the forcefield.) 
BASHIR: Would someone please get me out of here? 
(Fake Bashir morphs away into the ceiling. Sisko fires then gives the nod and Odo follows his countryman.) 
CREWMAN [OC]: Bridge to Captain Sisko. 
SISKO: Sisko here. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Sir, we're entering Tzenkethi space. 
[Bridge] 
SISKO: Any sign of Tzenkethi ships? 
EDDINGTON: Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. 
KIRA: We've altered course. Our new heading is zero one five mark four seven. We're headed directly for the Tzenkethi settlement on M'kemas Three. 
SISKO: How long before we're in weapons range of the settlement? 
KIRA: Twelve minutes. 
SISKO: Computer, this is Captain Benjamin Sisko. Initiate auto-destruct sequence. Authorisation Sisko alpha one alpha. 
COMPUTER: Identity confirmed. Additional authorisation required. 
KIRA: This is First Officer Kira Nerys. Auto-destruct authorisation Kira beta two beta. 
COMPUTER: Identity confirmed. Auto-destruct sequence armed. 
SISKO: Set the countdown for ten minutes from my mark. Authorisation Sisko one five destruct. Mark. 
(Red alert comes on.) 
COMPUTER: Sequence initiated. Auto-destruct in nine minutes, fifty five seconds. 
SISKO: Sisko to O'Brien. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien here. 
SISKO: I could use some good news right now, Chief. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: How about this? 
[Engine room] 
O'BRIEN: I think I may be able to shut down the changeling's forcefields and gain access to the sabotaged systems. The only problem is we may lose our 
[Bridge] 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Forcefields too. 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct in seven minutes. 
SISKO [OC]: Just tell me how long it will take. 
[Engine room] 
O'BRIEN: Well, I guess it'll have to be less than seven minutes, won't it. 
[Bridge] 
SISKO: That'd be my suggestion. Sisko out. 
EDDINGTON: Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? 
BASHIR: Still unconscious. The changeling gave her enough sedative to keep her under for days. I've managed to filter most of it out of her system, but she'll be out for another few hours. I wish I could do more. 
SISKO: You've done all you can, Doctor. Now it's up to Chief O'Brien. 
[Engine room] 
(O'Brien and an engineer are working on consoles.) 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct in six minutes. 
O'BRIEN: All right, we're almost there. Look, when we set off this device there's a possibility we may lose the protective field around the warp core. If that happens, this room is going to heat up real fast so give the warp core a wide berth or you'll get a dose of radiation poisoning even Bashir can't cure. 
(Odo morphs in from a grating.) 
ODO: Where's the changeling? I lost him in the conduits. 
O'BRIEN: We haven't seen him. 
(Then a second one morphs in from another grating.) 
ODO 2: Wait. It's me, Odo. 
O'BRIEN: You don't say. 
ODO 2: Chief, remember the last time we went kayaking in the holosuites. You had lamb stew for lunch. 
O'BRIEN: That's right. 
ODO: But you forgot to bring a fork. Anyone could have gotten that information. 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct in five minutes. 
ODO 2: You'd better make a decision. We're running out of time. 
O'BRIEN: I've got more important things to do than play choose the changeling. Keep the phaser on both of them. 
[Bridge] 
KIRA: The shuttlebay doors are sealed. The evacuation pods are locked down. We have no way out. 
EDDINGTON: Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. 
[Engine room] 
ODO 2: Chief, what are you doing? 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct in four minutes. 
O'BRIEN: You'll see. Now. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Warp core field breach. Engine room will be sealed in ten seconds. Evacuate immediately. 
(The alien forcefields go off too.) 
O'BRIEN: Shut down the main power grid. 
(Odo 2 morphs into Krajensky-founder and hits the engineer.) 
ODO: No! 
(The Founder knocks out O'Brien as the blast doors come down. Odo grabs him.) 
COMPUTER: Engine room sealed. (The founder morphs his arm into Odo's abdomen, and Odo starts to ripple.) 
FOUNDER: Why are you protecting these solids? You don't belong with them. You belong with us. 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct in three minutes. 
FOUNDER: Let go. Don't you see? You've lost. It's too late for you to help them but it's not too late to help yourself. Link with me, Odo. We can escape together. 
ODO: I don't think so. 
(Odo morphs his hands into the founder as his body becomes solid again. The founder goes gooey and Odo picks him up and pushes him against the warp core. The energy discharge throws Odo off as the founder fries.) 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct in two minutes. 
ODO: (to dazed O'Brien) You have to regain control of the ship. 
(The founder part reforms, looking very desiccated.) 
FOUNDER: Odo. 
ODO: I never wanted to harm you. 
(The changeling whispers something to Odo then turns to dark green ash.)

O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien to Bridge. 
SISKO: Go ahead, Chief. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: I've restored 
[Engine room] 
O'BRIEN: Control to the helm. She's all yours 
[Bridge] 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Captain. 
SISKO: Hard aport, Major. Take us away from the settlement. Computer, end auto-destruct sequence. Authorisation Sisko omega one seven abort. 
KIRA: This is Kira Nerys, First Officer. I concur. 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct sequence aborted. 
EDDINGTON: The phaser banks are powering down. 
SISKO: Take us home, Major. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We've returned to the station without further incident. However, I'm concerned about my Chief of Security, who hasn't said a word since we left Tzenkethi space. 
[Wardroom] 
SISKO: The real Ambassador Krajensky was supposed to be on his way to Risa for an extended vacation, but he never arrived. 
EDDINGTON: Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. 
BASHIR: What about the coup on the Tzenkethi homeworld? 
SISKO: It never happened. Starfleet Command wants a detailed report from each of us. 
(Odo enters.) 
KIRA: Odo, are you all right? 
ODO: I'm fine. I hope I'm not interrupting. 
DAX: Not at all. 
O'BRIEN: Have a seat. 
ODO: Captain, there's something you need to know. The changeling, before he died, he whispered something to me. 
SISKO: Go on. 
ODO: He said, you're too late. We are everywhere.
