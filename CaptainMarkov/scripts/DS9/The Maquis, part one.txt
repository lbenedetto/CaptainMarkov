The Maquis, part 1
[Airlock] 
(A group of Cardassians go back into their ship. A Starfleet engineer checks there's no one around and opens a panel on the ship's hatch and does something clever.) 
[Ops] 
DAX: The Cardassian freighter Bok'Nor is requesting permission to depart upper pylon one in three minutes. 
KIRA: We have an incoming Bolian vessel at coordinates one zero one mark three eight. Give the Bok'Nor a clear trajectory out of the traffic pattern. 
DAX: Acknowledged. 
KIRA: Feel like getting together for dinner tonight? 
DAX: Can't. I'm having dinner with Captain Boday. 
KIRA: The Gallamite? You're going out on a date with him? 
DAX: Is something wrong with that? 
KIRA: No. Not at all. 
DAX: He happens to be brilliant. His brain is twice the size of yours and mine. 
KIRA: I know. I've seen it. 
DAX: It's not his fault Gallamites have transparent skulls. 
KIRA: No, it's not. It's not exactly the view I want to have with dinner. 
DAX: You know, Kira, sometimes I think you place too much emphasis on how men look. 
KIRA: What's that supposed to mean? 
DAX: Nothing. 
KIRA: Look, when I kiss a man goodnight, I like to know where I'm kissing him. 
DAX: I guess seven lifetimes gives me a somewhat broader perspective. 
KIRA: Since I have just one lifetime, I have to be a little more particular about whom I go out with. 
DAX: I never said I wasn't particular. 
KIRA: I'm not the one who dates Ferengis. 
DAX: And what's that supposed to mean? 
KIRA: Nothing. 
DAX: Releasing docking clamps at upper pylon one. That's funny. I'm picking up elevated. DS Nine to Bok'Nor. Shut down your engines! Repeat, shut down your engines! 
(KaBOOM) 
KIRA: Report! 
DAX: Some kind of impulse overload. Checking. 
KIRA: Ops to all engineering personnel. Report to rescue stations. We have an S I D in progress. 
DAX: There's nothing left of it. There's no one left to rescue. 
[Runabout] 
O'BRIEN: Kelindide, rhodinium, nothing unusual there. All materials commonly used in Cardassian ship construction. 
KIRA: Maybe it was a malfunction in the impulse generator. 
O'BRIEN: I'd like to be able to tell you that, Major, but it's too soon to be sure. 
KIRA: I can't believe the Cardassians have waited this long for an official explanation. 
SISKO [on monitor]: Anything, Chief? 
O'BRIEN: No sign of an explosive device yet, sir. 
SISKO [on monitor]: I've got every Admiral within subspace range on my back. Can I at least tell them that it looks like an accident? 
O'BRIEN: Well, I wouldn't do that yet. 
SISKO [on monitor]: When? 
O'BRIEN: I'll let you know, sir. 
KIRA: Anything from the Cardassians, Commander? 
[Ops] 
SISKO: Not a word. 
ODO: All Bajoran outposts have been put on alert for retaliatory strikes. The provisional government has made a statement disavowing any responsibility. 
KIRA [on viewscreen]: Maybe it really was an accident. I mean, it is a possibility. 
ODO: An accident involving a Cardassian ship in Bajoran space? If I were a Cardassian, I wouldn't easily accept 
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: That's odd. 
SISKO: What? 
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: I'm picking up traces of a mercassium compound. 
DAX: Mercassium? There shouldn't have been any mercassium on board that ship. 
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Well, there was. 
SISKO: Meaning? 
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: I'm not quite sure yet. 
ODO: Is mercassium some kind of explosive? 
SISKO: No, it's a synthetic composite used in shield generator construction by the Federation. We don't share that technology with anyone. 
DAX: Chief, I don't think you're going to find evidence of an explosive device. 
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Lieutenant, respectfully, these kinds of things take time and I've got to 
DAX: I don't think you're going to find an explosive device because I'm pretty sure it was an implosive proto-matter device designed to match the impulse signature. Just before the explosion, I picked up a sudden increase in their fusion rate. I'm trying to find any sign of malfunction in the Bok'Nor's engines to explain it but there just isn't one. This doesn't look like an accident. The fusion shock had to be caused by something external to the impulse drive system. 
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: If a proto-matter device was attached to the crossfeeds, that could have created the overload and we'd never see any sign of it. 
SISKO: Can you prove that's what happened? 
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Maybe. If we could get a high resolution spectra of the impulse debris. But that's going to take some 
SISKO: Time. Yes, I know. Get it started. I'll tell the Admirals. Sisko out. 
(Cal Hudson arrives on the turbolift.) 
HUDSON: Benjamin. 
SISKO: Cal. Thanks for coming on such short notice. 
HUDSON: I wish it didn't take a disaster like this to get us back together. 
DAX: Hi, Calvin. 
SISKO: Jadzia Dax. 
HUDSON: Dax? My goodness. You look a lot better than the last time I saw you. 
SISKO: Chief of Security Odo. Lieutenant Commander Calvin Hudson, Starfleet's attach√© to the Federation colonies in the new Demilitarised Zone.
ODO: You must be concerned about the colonies' security at a time like this. 
HUDSON: Well, we haven't noticed any unusual deployment from the Cardassians along the border. 
ODO: Neither have we, and that's what's got me worried. 
SISKO: Let's go into my office. 
HUDSON: Lieutenant, I don't have time this trip, but you and I have a few stories to catch up on. 
DAX: Next time. 
HUDSON: Next time. 
[Commander's office] 
HUDSON: That woman knows more about me than any woman ever has. More than my wife, even. 
SISKO: Tell me about it. 
HUDSON: Don't you find things a little uncomfortable? 
SISKO: Oh, no. She's a good officer. 
HUDSON: Yes, but Curzon was a 
SISKO: She's not Curzon. 
HUDSON: Now, you two aren't? I mean 
(laughter) 
SISKO: Oh, no. She may not be Curzon, but she is Dax. 
HUDSON: Yes, that would be extremely strange. So, Ben, how is Jake? 
SISKO: As tall as me. 
HUDSON: No. 
SISKO: He throws inside to knock the old man off the plate. 
HUDSON: A little chin music, huh? 
SISKO: He's growing up too fast. 
HUDSON: It must have been difficult for you. At least I didn't have a child to raise by myself. 
SISKO: Well, we kind of helped each other through it. When I heard about Gretchen, I wanted to be there for you. There was just no way to get back. 
HUDSON: I know that, Ben. You know, I was hoping when they sent me to the colonies that you and I would have time for some R and R together. 
SISKO: Who's got R and R time? 
HUDSON: I know. You can't imagine how my life has changed since the Federation abandoned these colonies. 
SISKO: Abandoned them? Doesn't your presence there 
HUDSON: My presence there is a joke. I am supposed to help these colonies function under the terms of the new treaty. Now Ben, what the hell does that mean? 
SISKO: I thought these colonists wanted to stay. That they refused to evacuate. 
HUDSON: The treaty gave away their territory to the Cardassians, territory that these people had invested their lives in. Now, Ben, if you knew them as I do, you'd know why they can't leave. It's a bad treaty. The Federation gave away too much. 
SISKO: Several Cardassian colonies wanted to stay on the Federation side of the Zone too. It seemed like a reasonable compromise 
HUDSON: Well, yes, the Cardassians would love to have their colonies in our territory. Because they knew we'd protect them. But they have no intention of doing the same for ours. 
SISKO: A number of Admirals at Starfleet Command are worried the destruction of the Bok'Nor might jeopardise the treaty. 
HUDSON: Oh, are they really? 
SISKO: As the two ranking officers along the Cardassian border, we've been asked to assess the potential risk. 
HUDSON: There is no risk, Ben. None. I have been dealing with the Cardassians most of my professional life, and believe me, they are very pleased with what they got from the treaty. They are not about to risk all they've gained by sending forces into the Zone. They're much too slick for that. If I were you, I'd be very concerned with security along the Bajoran border. 
SISKO: Are you surprised they haven't responded at all yet? 
HUDSON: Well, Ben, you and I both know they never let you see what you expect to see. They'll respond. 
[Promenade] 
(A Vulcan woman speaks to the man who set the device. He is now in civilian clothes.) 
SAKONNA: Quarters have been arranged through discreet channels. Deck seven, section four G. I suggest you keep a low profile until your ship arrives. 
(Two aliens have watched from the railing above.) 
[Quark's] 
(Quark is counting his latinum when he realises the Vulcan is behind him.) 
QUARK: Can I get you something? 
SAKONNA: You are Quark, aren't you? 
QUARK: I assure you the warrant is out of date. I cleared that matter up months ago. 
SAKONNA: Warrant? 
QUARK: Oh. When you recognised me, I assumed 
SAKONNA: You are counting your receipts. It is logical to conclude you are the proprietor of the establishment. 
QUARK: You're very observant. What can I do for you? 
SAKONNA: I was hoping to discuss a business proposition. 
QUARK: With me? Er, perhaps I should explain about that slip of the tongue. 
SAKONNA: Your past is of no consequence to me. 
QUARK: I'm delighted to hear you say that. Because nothing would please me more than to make a fresh start with the Vulcans, Miz 
SAKONNA: Sakonna. 
QUARK: Sakonna. Such a handsome name for such a handsome young woman. What'll you have to drink? Wait a minute, I have just the thing. 
QUARK: Vulcan port. Three centuries old. Very rare, very expensive. Shall I pour you a glass? 
SAKONNA: No. 
QUARK: Not even a taste? It's exquisite. 
(It's also a deep blue-grey.) 
SAKONNA: I'm not thirsty, thus I see no reason to have a drink. 
QUARK: Well, it'll be right here should you develop a thirst. Now, you mentioned a business proposition? 
SAKONNA: It is a private matter. I'd rather not discuss it here. 
QUARK: Then we can discuss it over dinner. That is, we can plan the business meeting to coincide with when you think you might get hungry. 
SAKONNA: That would be acceptable. 
QUARK: That would be wonderful. How does eight sound to your tummy? 
SAKONNA: I will return then. 
(Sakonna leaves) 
QUARK: (straight to camera) And by the way, I'd love to melt that cold Vulcan heart of yours. 
(The port is vile) 
[Habitat corridor] 
(Our bomber is walking along, when the female alien approaches and drops her purse.) 
BOMBER: Here, allow me. 
FEMALE: Thank you. 
(The male alien comes up behind and hypo's him. They drag him away.) 
[Sisko's quarters] 
SISKO: Jake-O? 
DUKAT: Your son is not here, Commander 
SISKO: Dukat. 
DUKAT: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. 
SISKO: Where is he? 
DUKAT: Who? Your son? How would I know? I just (pause) Commander, you don't? Do you think that I would ever do anything to harm your son? 
SISKO: I think you're capable of anything. 
DUKAT: You wound me, sir. I'm here as your friend. 
SISKO: Sisko to Kira. 
DUKAT: Please do not do anything hastily, Commander. We must talk in private. 
KIRA [OC]: Yes, Commander? 
SISKO: Major, I want you to find Jake. 
KIRA [OC]: Is he missing? 
SISKO: I don't know. Find out where he is and let me know. 
KIRA [OC]: Understood. 
SISKO: How the hell did you get in here? 
DUKAT: I was an unregistered passenger on a Kotakian ship that docked here this morning. I slipped in through the cargo bay. 
SISKO: And made your way here without anyone seeing you? 
DUKAT: I was the commander of this station for almost ten years. When one knows the various corridors and passageways as well as I. Oh, by the way, I love what you've done with these quarters. 
KIRA [OC]: Kira to Sisko. Jake's fine, Commander. He's with Nog watching the women coming off the Bajoran transport at docking bay one. Shall I have him brought to your quarters? 
SISKO: No, that's all right. Thank you, Major. Sisko out. 
DUKAT: There, you see. Safe and sound. 
SISKO: What are you doing here? 
DUKAT: You have a problem. 
SISKO: Do I? 
DUKAT: The Bok'Nor. 
SISKO: Is this the Cardassian Central Command's way of responding to my communiqu√©s?
DUKAT: On the contrary, Central Command has no idea I'm here. It's true. I'm here unofficially to help you find out the truth about the Bok'Nor. 
SISKO: Why would you want to help me? 
DUKAT: Because I already know the truth. 
SISKO: You know who's responsible? 
DUKAT: I do. 
SISKO: Who? 
DUKAT: You are. Oh, not you personally, Commander. I know you to be an honourable man. You're not one to sneak around attaching implosion devices to impulse engines. But, believe it or not, there are those of your brethren who are willing to do such things. Morally superior human beings and other members of the Federation. 
SISKO: I'm supposed to take your word for that? 
DUKAT: Of course not. It's my job to convince you so you can clean your own house instead of forcing us to do it for you, which would certainly endanger the new treaty. We'll need one of your runabouts. 
SISKO: Where are we going? 
DUKAT: The Volan colonies. 
SISKO: The Demilitarised zone? 
DUKAT: Not so demilitarised, I'm afraid. 
[Runabout] 
DUKAT: I can't help but notice that my controls are not illuminated. Isn't it customary for both seats to be turned on so that I may pilot the craft in the event of an emergency? 
SISKO: If there's an emergency, I guess you're out of luck. 
DUKAT: Commander, I'm not going to sit here and steal all your little technical secrets, I promise you. 
SISKO: I appreciate your assurances, but Cardassians are famous for their photographic memories. 
DUKAT: So you turn off my controls so I don't have enough light to take my photograph, is that it? 
SISKO: I've heard they put Cardassian children in intense mind training programmes when they're four years old. Is that true? 
DUKAT: The Cardassian educational system is unparalleled in the quadrant. 
SISKO: If you don't mind taking the joy out of growing up. 
DUKAT: Education is power. Joy is vulnerability. 
SISKO: What? 
DUKAT: Your reaction surprises me, Commander. I thought you would understand. Of all the humans I've met, you strike me as the most joyless and the least vulnerable. 
SISKO: I am when I'm with you. 
DUKAT: Well said. But in truth, I'm looking forward to getting to know you better on this journey. 
SISKO: I think we know each other well enough. 
DUKAT: Is that a ramscoop control or a deflector grid panel? Just curious. It really doesn't matter. Cardassian pursuit vessels are years ahead of this design. 
(A beep) 
DUKAT: What is it? 
SISKO: Long range sensors are picking up a distress signal. 
DUKAT: From whom? 
SISKO: A Federation merchant vessel under attack by Cardassians. I'm reading two Cardassian attack vessels just inside the Demilitarised zone. 
DUKAT: That's not possible. I promise you, Commander, we would not violate the treaty. 
SISKO: The merchant vessel's comm. links are down. I can't raise them. Computer, fix source coordinates of the distress signal and lay in a new course, warp three. I hope you don't mind. 
DUKAT: Not at all. I'm as curious about this as you are. 
(The runabout goes to warp) 
DUKAT: What type of Cardassian ship are they? Patrol cruisers? 
SISKO: No, much smaller. They look like shuttlecraft. 
DUKAT: Cardassian shuttles attacking a Federation merchant ship? 
SISKO: They seem to be armed with Galor-class phaser banks. 
DUKAT: They must be from Cardassian colonies in the Demilitarised zone. Hail them. 
SISKO: No response. 
DUKAT: Open a channel. 
SISKO: Go ahead. 
DUKAT: To the pilots of the Cardassian attack vessels. This is Gul Dukat, Commander of the Second Order. Please respond. This is Gul Dukat, security identification ADL four zero. I order you to immediately disengage your attack. 
SISKO: We're still two minutes away. The Federation vessel's shields are down to forty percent. 
DUKAT: Hail those Cardassians again. I don't know who you are or where you come from, but you're going to pay for this, I promise you. Answer me immediately or I personally will fire the photons that will destroy you. Arm the photons. 
SISKO: The photon launcher is there. 
DUKAT: I know. I knew all about these controls before I ever came aboard. Tell me when we're in torpedo range. 
SISKO: Stand by. I'm picking up another ship moving toward them. 
DUKAT: That's a Federation signature I believe, Commander. 
SISKO: It sure isn't from Starfleet. I've never seen a ship configuration like that before. It almost seems like someone has modified an old support courier. Hailing them. No response. They've fired torpedoes. what kind of civilian vessel that size would be carrying photon? 
DUKAT: Something from one of your colonies, perhaps? 
(The two Cardassian blips vanish from the monitor.) 
DUKAT: Do you begin to see, Commander, that without any help from either one of us, they've managed to start their own little war out here. 
[Quark's cafe] 
(A private table set for dinner) 
QUARK: I hope you're hungry. I've planned a wonderful meal for us starting with plomeek soup, which I know is a traditional Vulcan favourite. Followed by jumbo Romulan molluscs. You can't get those back on Vulcan any more, can you. 
SAKONNA: Do you eat in this grand a manner every night? 
QUARK: Certainly not. This is a special occasion. 
SAKONNA: It is? 
QUARK: The commencement of a new business relationship is the most special occasion for any Ferengi. It's a cause for opening great bottles of wine, dancing into the wee, small hours of the morning. We'll let it breathe for a few minutes. 
SAKONNA: Very well, I will attempt to respect some of your cultural idiosyncrasies. I will drink the wine, but I won't dance. 
QUARK: Maybe you'll change your mind after you drink the wine. 
SAKONNA: No. I won't. 
QUARK: Oh, come on. Somewhere inside that cool, controlled exterior of yours, there's a wild woman screaming to get out. Maybe by the end of the night, you'll be dancing on the tabletops. Maybe not. 
SAKONNA: Is it appropriate to begin our business discussion now? 
QUARK: Rule of Acquisition number two fourteen. Never begin a business negotiation on an empty stomach. 
SAKONNA: Rule of Acquisition? 
QUARK: Yes. Every Ferengi business transaction is governed by two hundred and eighty five Rules of Acquisition to insure a fair and honest deal for all parties concerned. Well, most of them anyway. 
SAKONNA: Commendable. To create a code of behaviour for business transactions is 
QUARK: Is logical. 
SAKONNA: and quite reassuring. 
QUARK: Do Vulcans have anything similar? 
SAKONNA: In structure, it reminds one of the Vulcan Bill of Rights which guarantees the fundamental personal freedoms of every Vulcan citizen. 
QUARK: Same thing exactly. May I propose a toast? 
SAKONNA: Is this another cultural idiosyncrasy? 
QUARK: Yes. You know, I can't describe the honour I feel at this moment. It's rare that a Ferengi and a Vulcan can overcome their inherent differences to see eye-to-eye as we're doing. I've always had the greatest respect for Vulcans, even though the few I've met haven't exactly felt the same way about me. You are a noble people and I salute you. Now then, what kind of business proposition do you have in mind? 
SAKONNA: I wish to procure weapons. 
QUARK: I beg your pardon? 
SAKONNA: Guns, phaser banks, photon torpedoes 
QUARK: Shh! 
SAKONNA: (sotto) Troop transports and a number of cobalt-thorium devices. My list is quite extensive. 
QUARK: You're a gun runner? 
SAKONNA: I'm prepared to pay in latinum and I will very likely need a continuous supply for the foreseeable future. 
QUARK: You're not like other Vulcans, are you? 
[Meeting house] 
(Welcome to Volan 3) 
EVEK: (Cardassian Gul) The Federation merchant ship refused to be boarded! 
AMAROS: So your ships just decided to open fire. 
EVEK: It was clear the Federation ship was carrying weapons through the Demilitarised zone. 
(Sisko and Dukat enter) 
HUDSON: That ship was carrying medical supplies to Soltok Four. Ben, what are you doing here? 
SISKO: I'm not sure yet. Gul Dukat asked me to accompany him. 
EVEK: Dukat. No one informed us you were coming. 
DUKAT: I decided an impromptu visit would be preferable so you wouldn't be bothered with special preparations. 
EVEK: I see. 
HUDSON: Commander Sisko, do you know my counterpart from the colonies, Gul Evek? 
EVEK: I'm glad you're here to listen to this, Commander. 
SISKO: We monitored the attack on the way in. 
DUKAT: Yes, monitor is the proper word because none of the ships would respond to our hails. Even the Cardassian pilots refused to acknowledge me. 
EVEK: A strange voice from a Federation runabout. 
DUKAT: I gave them my security identification. 
EVEK: Well, obviously they had their hands full. 
KOBB: (woman) With an unprovoked attack. 
EVEK: Unprovoked, was it? Do you deny that the Federation is engaging in organised terrorist activities against the Cardassian people? Deliberately attempting to undermine this treaty? 
SISKO: The Federation does not conduct secret wars. 
EVEK: Then perhaps then you can explain where the Federation ship came from, the one outfitted with photon torpedoes? 
HUDSON: Explaining why your ships were armed with Galor-class phaser banks? 
EVEK: They have a right to defend themselves against organised terrorist activities. 
SISKO: I haven't heard any proof yet of organised terrorist activities. 
AMAROS: Because there is none. 
EVEK: On the contrary, we have the confession of the Federation terrorist responsible for the destruction of the Bok'Nor at your station, Commander. 
SISKO: Confession? 
(Evek's assistant hands him a PADD) 
EVEK: A forty three year old male human, William Patrick Samuels, born Bergan, Norway, Earth. 
AMAROS: We know who he is. What have you done with him? 
EVEK: Came to the Federation colony on Volan Two twenty years ago. Married, wife's name Louise, two female children aged fourteen and twelve. He was quite cooperative once we apprehended him on Deep Space Nine. 
(Hudson puts the data rod into a desk monitor) 
CARDASSIAN [OC]: Begin. 
SAMUELS [on monitor]: My name is William Samuels. I am being held for crimes against the Cardassian people. I have been well treated. I have confessed that, as a member of a well-armed anti-Cardassian force organised by Federation colonists, I set an implosion device that destroyed the freighter Bok'Nor. I deeply regret participating in this arbitrary attack that led to the deaths of over seventy five crewmen. To my wife and children, I'm sorry, and I love you. 
AMAROS: He would have confessed to anything after you were through with him 
EVEK: On the contrary, he confessed quite early in the interrogation procedure, far sooner than we expected. I believe he truly felt remorse. 
HUDSON: We want to talk to him ourselves. 
EVEK: Bring him in. 
(A body is carried in on a stretcher) 
EVEK: Unfortunately, he committed suicide in his cell. 
(Amaros leaps over the table and tries to throttle Evek. Hudson pulls him off) 
HUDSON: Come on, come on. It's all right, it's all right. 
SISKO: Dukat, get them out of here. 
DUKAT: Get outside. 
HUDSON: Go on. We'll talk later. 
KOBB: We can't let them get away with this. 
HUDSON: We'll talk later. You go on. Get him out of here. 
(A native american helps carry Samuel's body away again.) 
(Later.) 
HUDSON: I knew him. Bill Samuels was a farmer. He cultivated his land for twenty years. He raised two kids on that land. He made something out of that land and the Federation told him he had to give it all up to the Cardassians. Well, he just was not willing to do that. 
SISKO: And it was people like him who made both sides realise that some accommodation had to be made for the colonies so they could stay. 
HUDSON: The Cardassians have no intention of allowing these people to stay. They will either force them out or they will kill them. It's already started. Not a day goes when there's not some random act of violence against our people. Every Federation colonist knows you do not go out alone at night. Can you imagine living in that kind of fear? 
SISKO: If you're saying the Cardassian authorities are not enforcing the laws, we can 
HUDSON: Enforcing the laws? The Cardassian authorities were part of a mob that stoned two colonists on the streets of Ropal City three days ago. 
SISKO: That's something the Federation can take up with the Cardassians at the highest level. 
HUDSON: Well that will help a lot. The word is the Cardassian High Command is arming their colonists to the teeth. 
SISKO: You really think they'd risk sending weapons into the Demilitarised zone and breaking the treaty? 
HUDSON: I think they'll find a way to do it that's not so obvious. 
SISKO: Not long ago, we caught the Cardassians shipping weapons to Bajoran extremists through a third party, the Yridians. 
HUDSON: That sounds about right. Could the Bok'Nor have been transferring weapons to someone else to bring in here? 
SISKO: If it was, the transfer was made before the ship reached the station. The cargo holds of the Bok'Nor were empty. Do you think he did it? 
HUDSON: Samuels? I don't know. They could have forced him to make a false confession and then killed him. 
SISKO: I don't think Gul Dukat would drag me all the way here unless he knew he could prove it. 
HUDSON: Then, maybe he did do it, Ben. I don't know. Damn! I've got to go see his wife. I don't know what I'm going to tell her. Makes you pine for the good old dull days in New Berlin, doesn't it? Sausage and beer all around, and everyone's idea of a good time was the mazurka Festival. 
SISKO: Gretchen and Jennifer had a ball together there, didn't they? 
HUDSON: I'll never forget the sight of you in those lederhosen. 
SISKO: I still have the hat. Is there something larger going on here, Cal? Are these colonists organising some kind of terrorist campaign? 
HUDSON: Well if they are, they're not about to tell me about it. But I'll tell you one thing, Ben, between you and me, those people have every right to defend themselves. When the Federation said goodbye to them, they left them no other choice. 
[Runabout] 
DUKAT: You're very quiet, Commander. 
SISKO: You knew about Samuels before we left. 
DUKAT: I knew about his confession, yes. I didn't know he was. I was as surprised as you were by his death. 
SISKO: No one is going to buy your suicide story. I don't care what he did. This kind of barbaric disregard for life will gut this treaty. 
DUKAT: If it means anything, I entirely agree. I told Evek he was a fool to let Samuels die. A good interrogator doesn't allow his subject to die. You lose the advantage. 
SISKO: That's all you're interested in, isn't it. The advantage. 
DUKAT: Oh, now don't go spouting off your holier-than-thou Federation fair-play dogma. And lest we forget, your man was responsible for the deaths of seventy eight innocent crewman. 
SISKO: What was the Bok'Nor transporting? 
DUKAT: The Bok'Nor had just delivered fourteen metric tones of golside ore to the Regulon system prior to its arrival at the wormhole. 
SISKO: You're sure it wasn't carrying weapons? 
DUKAT: Weapons? To whom? 
SISKO: To the Cardassians in the Demilitarised zone. 
DUKAT: No. The route of the Bok'Nor didn't take it anywhere near the Demilitarised zone. 
SISKO: It could have rendezvoused with someone else. With the Lissepians, maybe. They could have transferred the weapons to them and they could have taken the weapons 
DUKAT: Commander, I know you'd love to find some justification for this mass murder to ease your Federation conscience, but if the Bok'Nor was carrying weapons, I would know. And on the lives of my children, I swear to you it was not. 
SISKO: I didn't know you had children. 
DUKAT: Seven. 
[Quark's] 
SAKONNA: I received your message. How soon will it be available? 
QUARK: My source can have everything ready tomorrow, say by fourteen hundred hours. 
SAKONNA: That's not soon enough. I must leave the station tonight. 
QUARK: You're leaving so soon? 
SAKONNA: My plans have changed. Can your source have the materials ready by tonight? 
QUARK: I guess he'll have to. 
SAKONNA: I have your latinum if you'd like to count it. 
QUARK: Are you trustworthy? 
SAKONNA: I'm a Vulcan. 
QUARK: Of course. Just a little joke. I'm sure it's all there. Well, it wouldn't hurt to give it a quick count, I suppose. 
SAKONNA: I will have it brought to your quarters. 
QUARK: I was looking forward to showing you more ways to mix business with pleasure. 
SAKONNA: Perhaps in the future. I do find you intriguing, Quark. 
(Sakonna leaves) 
QUARK: Intriguing. 
[Promenade] 
(Sisko and Dukat come out of the airlock) 
SISKO: You can stay in the guest suite on level H Two while you arrange transport back to Cardassia. I'll have a security guard sent to meet you there. 
DUKAT: Starfleet security, if you don't mind, Commander. Some of the Bajoran deputies are still around in the good old days when I was in charge. 
SISKO: I understand. 
DUKAT: If there's anything else I can do to assist you in your investigation. 
SISKO: I think I can handle it from here. 
[Ops] 
SISKO: Chief? 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. I've got answers for you but I'm not sure you're going to like them. 
SISKO: It was an implosive device. 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir, and not only that 
SISKO: Not only that, it was a Federation implosive device. 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. The traces of mercassium we found were from the casing of the device itself. It had to be a Federation design. 
SISKO: Get me Starfleet Command on subspace. 
[Commander's office] 
KIRA: Commander, is there anything you'd like me to communicate to the Provisional Government? 
SISKO: Tell them some reckless colonist in the Demilitarised zone blew up the Bok'Nor. There's no further threat of Cardassian reprisals to Bajor. 
KIRA: I'll advise all of our outposts to stand down. Sir, are you, are we facing the prospect of war here? 
SISKO: Not if I can help it. 
KIRA: But that's what the colonists are after. 
SISKO: I don't think they know what they're after, Major. I just know they have to be stopped, and it's Starfleet's job to stop them. 
KIRA: Sir, I know this is none of my business 
SISKO: But you're going to give me your opinion anyway. 
KIRA: I don't know what the Cardassians told you 
SISKO: They played a confession from the man who planted the bomb. A man they most likely tortured to death. 
KIRA: And you don't think you might be playing into their hands? 
SISKO: I've got people out there killing people, Major. You suggest I turn a blind eye to that? 
KIRA: Well, they don't have a right to defend themselves? 
SISKO: They've crossed the line. 
KIRA: If Starfleet is unwilling to defend their people in 
SISKO: They chose to live with the Cardassians. 
KIRA: Well, I didn't. But I lived with them for twenty six years before the liberation came. Every Bajoran lived with them in constant fear. I know what those colonists are going through. Most of all, I know that the Cardassians can't be trusted to keep their side of the bargain in this treaty. 
SISKO: So, you'd suggest the Federation not keep our side of the bargain either, perhaps by arming these colonists? 
KIRA: I can tell you one thing for certain. The Cardassians are the enemy, not your own colonists, and if Starfleet can't understand that, then the Federation is even more naive than I already think it is. 
(Sisko opens the door for her to leave.) 
[Corridor] 
NILES: I've been sent to relieve you 
GUARD: There must be some mistake. I just reported for duty an hour 
(Sakonna neck-pinches the guard and rings the doorbell) 
DUKAT [OC]: Yes? 
NILES: Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's a message here from Commander Sisko. 
SAKONNA: We have been asked to escort you to airlock eleven, sir. 
NILES: A Cardassian freighter's just arrived. 
DUKAT: Is there a problem? 
NILES: Apparently another bomb has been found and disarmed. 
[Airlock] 
DUKAT: Where's Commander Sisko? 
AMAROS: Comfortably asleep in his quarters, I hope. Remember me? 
DUKAT: I take it we're not about to board a Cardassian freighter. 
(Dukat knocks out Sakonna and makes a run for it. He gets shot in the back by Niles.) 
[Ops] 
(Sisko is having the following inaudible but heated argument with someone on his desk monitor behind the main dialogue. Everyone is watching.) 
SISKO: I'm hoping I don't have to remind the admiral how many people pass through here during a week's time. It's not possible to keep tabs on every single person while they're on the station 
ADMIRAL: If I didn't know you better, commander, I'd think you were just making excuses 
SISKO: I'm not making excuses! Would it be in keeping with Federation policy to frisk everyone who steps through our airlocks? To search every room of every visitor during their stay? 
ADMIRAL: Of course not but with two kidnappings and a ship being destroyed all in less than a week's time obviously your security measures leave something to be desired 
SISKO: Security on this station is by the book. Our security programme and the officers who work in it are first-rate. 
ADMIRAL: Then what were they doing when all this was happening? We here at Starfleet are watching how you resolve this situation very closely, commander. We think it might be prudent to replace this chief of security you have 
SISKO: Odo is both highly intelligent and extremely thorough. He's the most qualified person I have for the job. 
ADMIRAL: Still, it would be a concrete example that you are taking active measures to resolve this situation and to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
SISKO: I stand behind my chief of security one hundred percent. 
ADMIRAL: That may be a mistake, Commander 
SISKO: Then it's my mistake. 
ADMIRAL: Then let me make my point again. Starfleet is very unhappy this has happened. We want this matter taken care of immediately. I don't have to remind you how this reflects on your position 
SISKO: We're doing everything we can to apprehend the kidnappers 
ADMIRAL: Don't bother me with details. Just clean up the mess, Commander. And quickly. Before this becomes a permanent stain on your record. Do I make myself clear? 
SISKO: Yes, sir. 
BASHIR: What do you think they're telling him? 
KIRA: With two kidnappings and a ship exploding in the course of a week, I'm sure they've got a few things to say. 
ODO: It's their own fault. I've been warning them from the beginning. 
O'BRIEN: What are you talking about, their fault? You're in charge of Security. 
ODO: If you will let me be in charge of Security I will give you a safe station. You people tell me to do my job then give me a Federation rulebook listing all the things I can't do. Untie my hands before you start to blame me, Mister O'Brien. 
DAX: I'm sure no one meant to blame you, Odo. 
ODO: Give me the right to set a curfew, let me do more searches of arriving passengers, give me fifty more deputies. 
KIRA: And this station will be just the way it was during the occupation. 
ODO: Say what you like, it was safer then. 
KIRA: Unless you happened to be a Bajoran. 
SISKO: I want a complete review of all security measures on board this station. 
ODO: I'd be delighted to accommodate you. 
SISKO: What do we have from the guard? 
KIRA: He's given us a description of the two who assaulted him. A Vulcan female and a human male in a Starfleet officer's uniform. 
ODO: We're trying to locate anyone they might have contacted here. 
SISKO: How many ships left the station during the night? 
O'BRIEN: Only two, sir. A Bardeezan merchant ship and a Galador freighter. 
SISKO: What were their destinations? 
O'BRIEN: The Bardeezans went through the wormhole. The freighter is operating on a trade route between Galador Two and Farius Prime. 
SISKO: I'm guessing these people wouldn't take Dukat through the wormhole. They'd head back to the Demilitarised Zone with him. Dax, check the Galador ship's registry and make sure it's in order. Chief, see if you can identify its warp signature from our sensor records. 
O'BRIEN: No problem, Commander. I've got it. 
SISKO: Last known course? 
O'BRIEN: The computer's showing it was on a bearing two one six, mark one seven seven. As it left our sensor range, it was still heading for Farius Prime. 
SISKO: Major, send a message to Farius Prime. If that ship shows up, and I doubt it will, I want to know about it right away. 
KIRA: I could send the warp signature out over subspace. 
O'BRIEN: We could make it a general transmission. If it changes course, someone should spot them. 
SISKO: Do it. 
DAX: It's a phony. The Galadorans don't have any ships in this sector. The registry is forged. 
SISKO: Doctor, Major, you're with me. Odo, send a message to Commander Hudson at the Volan colony that I'm moving in his direction on the assumption that Dukat will be taken to the Demilitarised zone. Give him the warp signature of the ship. 
ODO: Aye, sir. 
KIRA: Commander, we just received a general subspace transmission from somewhere in the Demilitarised zone. A group there is taking credit for the kidnapping of Dukat. They're calling themselves the Maquis. 
[Runabout] 
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: Commander, a Klingon freighter two light years from the Demilitarised zone has ID'ed the warp signature. The ship did change course just as you predicted. 
SISKO: Transmit their last known coordinates and heading to us, Chief. 
KIRA: Acknowledged. 
SISKO: Let us know if anyone else picks up their signature. 
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: Aye, sir. O'Brien out. 
SISKO: Set a new course, Major. 
KIRA: Yes, sir. Their heading takes them into the Badlands. 
BASHIR: Badlands? 
KIRA: It's a stretch of the Cardassian border ships try to avoid. A lot of plasma storms in the area. 
SISKO: A few ships have been lost there over the past year or two. 
BASHIR: Sounds like the perfect place for a hideout. Excuse me, sir. What do you plan to do if we catch up with them? After all, these Maquis are Federation colonists. 
SISKO: We're going to get Gul Dukat back by any means necessary. 
BASHIR: Even if we have to fire on our own people? 
KIRA: Long range sensors are picking up the warp signature. It leads to an M-class asteroid. 
SISKO: Take us there. 
(At the asteroid) 
KIRA: Scanning the surface. I've located the ship. 
BASHIR: Those are human life signs. 
SISKO: Is there a Cardassian among them? 
BASHIR: No, sir. 
SISKO: Prepare to beam down. 
[Jungle] 
(Kira, Bashir and Sisko are surrounded by armed civilians.) 
HUDSON: I'm glad to see you had no trouble finding us, Ben. It seems that one disaster after another keeps bringing us back together again.
