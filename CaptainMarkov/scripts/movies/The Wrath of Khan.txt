Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
OPENING CREDITS 
IN THE 23RD CENTURY...
[Bridge simulator room] 
Captain's log, stardate 8130.3. Starship Enterprise on training mission to Gamma Hydra, Section fourteen, coordinates twenty-two eighty-seven four. Approaching Neutral Zone, all systems normal and functioning. 
SULU: Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
SAAVIK: Stand by. Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
SULU: Aye, Captain. ...Course change projected.
UHURA: Captain, ...I'm getting something on the distress channel.
SAAVIK: On speakers!
KOBAYASHI MARU VOICE: Imperative! This is the Kobayashi Maru, ...nineteen periods out of Altair Six. We have struck a gravitic mine and have lost all power. ...Our hull is penetrated and we have sustained many casualties.
UHURA: This is the Starship Enterprise. Your message is breaking up. Can you give your coordinates? Repeat. This is the Starship...
KOBAYASHI MARU VOICE: Enterprise, our position is Gamma Hydra, Section Ten.
SAAVIK: In the Neutral Zone.
KOBAYASHI MARU VOICE: Hull penetrated, life support systems failing. Can you assist us, Enterprise? Can you assist us?
SAAVIK: Data on Kobayashi Maru!
COMPUTER VOICE: Subject vessel is third class neutronic fuel carrier, crew of eighty-one, three hundred passengers.
SAAVIK: Damn. Mister Sulu, plot an intercept course.
SULU: May I remind the Captain that if a starship enters the Zone.
SAAVIK: I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister
SULU: Estimating two minutes to intercept. ...Now entering the Neutral Zone.
COMPUTER VOICE: Warning. We have entered the Neutral Zone. ...Warning.
SPOCK: We are now in violation of Treaty, Captain
SAAVIK: Stand by transporter room, ready to beam survivors aboard.
UHURA: Captain, I've lost their signal!
COMPUTER VOICE: Alert! Sensors indicate three Klingon Cruisers, bearing three one six, mark four, closing fast.
SAAVIK: Visual! ...Battle stations! Activate shields!
SULU: Shields activated!
SAAVIK: Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission.
UHURA: They're jamming all the frequencies, Captain.
COMPUTER VOICE: Klingons on attack course and closing.
SAAVIK: We're in over our heads. Mister Sulu, get us out of here.
SULU: I'll try, Captain.
COMPUTER VOICE: Alert! Klingon torpedoes activated.
SAAVIK: Evasive action!
(an explosion rocks the bridge)
SAAVIK: Engineering! Damage report!
SCOTT (OC): Main energiser hit, Captain!
SAAVIK: Engage auxiliary power. Prepare to return fire!
(another explosion rocks the bridge)
CADET: Shields collapsing, Captain!
SAAVIK: Fire all phasers!
SPOCK: No power to the weapons, Captain.
(yet another explosion rocks the bridge)
SCOTT (OC): Captain, it's no use. We're dead in space.
SAAVIK: Activate escape pods. Send out the Log Buoy. ...All hands abandon ship. Repeat, ...all hands abandon ship.
KIRK (OC): All right, open her up.
SAAVIK: Any suggestions, Admiral?
KIRK: Prayer, Mister Saavik. The Klingons don't take prisoners. Lights!
TANNOY VOICE: Motors on!
KIRK: Captain!
SPOCK: Trainees ...to the briefing room.
TANNOY VOICE: Maintenance Crew! Report to the bridge simulator.
KIRK: Physician, heal thyself.
McCOY: Is that's all you gotta to say? What about my performance?
KIRK: I'm not a drama critic. ...Well, Mister Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
SAAVIK: Permission to speak candidly, sir?
KIRK: Granted.
SAAVIK: I don't believe this was a fair test of my command abilities.
KIRK: And why not?
SAAVIK: Because ...there was no way to win.
KIRK: A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
SAAVIK: No sir. It has not.
KIRK: How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
SAAVIK: As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
KIRK: Well, now you have something new to think about. Carry on.
McCOY: Admiral? Wouldn't it be easier to just put an experienced crew back on the ship?
KIRK: Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, Doctor.
UHURA: Now what is that supposed to mean?
[Corridor outside bridge simulator room] 
KIRK: Aren't you dead? I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
SPOCK: I am understandably curious.
KIRK: They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
SPOCK: The Kobayashi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment. As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
KIRK: It had the virtue of never having been tried. Oh, by the way, ...thank you for this.
SPOCK: I know of your fondness for antiques.
KIRK: 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times' ...Message, Spock?
SPOCK: None of that I'm conscious of ...except, of course, happy birthday, ...surely the best of times.
TANNOY VOICE: Captain Spock, Captain Spock, space shuttle leaving in fifteen minutes.
KIRK: Where are you off to, now?
SPOCK: The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
KIRK: Home.
[Kirk's apartment] 
KIRK: Why! Bless me, Doctor! What beams you into this neck of the woods?
McCOY: 'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday, Jim.
KIRK: Romulan Ale! Why, Bones, you know this is illegal.
McCOY: I only use it for medicinal purposes. I got aboard a ship that brings me in a case every now and then across the Neutral Zone. Now don't be a prig.
KIRK: Twenty-two, eighty-three.
McCOY: Yeah well it takes this stuff a while to ferment. Here now, gimme. ...Now you open this one.
KIRK: I'm almost afraid to. What is it? Klingon aphrodisiacs?
McCOY: No.
KIRK: Oh. ...Bones, this is ...charming.
McCOY: For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retnax Five.
KIRK: I'm allergic to Retnax Five.
McCOY: Exactly. Cheers!
KIRK: Cheers! ...Aahh!
McCOY: Happy Birthday!
KIRK: I don't know what to say.
McCOY: Well you could say thank you.
KIRK: Thank you.
McCOY: Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter with you? Other people have birthdays. Why are we treating yours like a funeral?
KIRK: Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
McCOY: What the hell do you want? ...This is not about age, ...and you know it. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out there hopping Galaxies.
KIRK: Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties.
McCOY: Bull. You're hiding ...hiding behind rules and regulations.
KIRK: Who am I hiding from?
McCOY: From yourself, Admiral!
KIRK: Don't mince words, Bones, What do you really think?
McCOY: Jim, I'm your doctor and I'm your friend. Get back your command. Get it back before you turn into part of this collection. Before you really do grow old.
Starship log, stardate 8130.4. Log entry by First Officer Pavel Chekov. Starship Reliant on orbital approach to Ceti Alpha VI, in connection with Project Genesis. We are continuing our search for a lifeless planet to satisfy the requirements of a test site for the Genesis Experiment. So far no success. 
[Reliant bridge] 
TERRELL: Standard orbit please. Mister Beach. Any change in the surface scan?
BEACH: Negative. Limited atmosphere, dominated by craylon gas, sand and high velocity winds. It's incapable of supporting lifeforms.
CHEKOV: Does it have to be completely lifeless?
TERRELL: Don't tell me you've found something.
CHEKOV: We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dynoscanner.
TERRELL: Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment.
CHEKOV: I suppose it could be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix.
TERRELL: All right, get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus.
KYLE: Aye sir.
TERRELL: Maybe it's something we can transplant.
CHEKOV: You know what she'll say.
[Regula I space laboratory] 
CAROL (OC): Now let me get this straight. Something you can transplant?
CHEKOV (OC): Yes, Doctor.
[Regula I lab] 
CAROL: Something you can transplant? I don't know.
TERRELL (on viewscreen): It might only be a particle of preanimate matter.
CAROL: Then again it may not. You boys have to be clear on this. There can't be so much as a microbe or the show's off. Why don't you have a look? But if it is something that can be moved I want...
TERRELL (on viewscreen): You bet, Doctor. We're on our way!
[Regula I corridor] 
DAVID: Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember you in one breath with Newton, Einstein, Surak.
CAROL: Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring.
DAVID: Par for the course. Are you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
CAROL: Maybe. ...What is it?
DAVID: Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous. ...We are dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown Boy Scout you used to hang around with? That's exactly the kind of man...
CAROL: Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many things, but he was never a Boy Scout!
[Reliant orbiting Ceti Alpha V] 
RELIANT VOICE: Captain Terrell, stand by to beam down.
[Surface of Ceti Alpha V] 
TERRELL: Chekov, are you sure these are the correct coordinates?
CHEKOV: Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha Six.
TERRELL: I can barely see it.
CHEKOV: There's nothing here. The tricorder must be broken.
TERRELL: Chekov, over here. Those look like cargo carriers. Hey, give me a hand.
[Cargo bay] 
TERRELL: What the hell happened? If they crashed, where's the rest of the ship?
(looking at a tank with moving sand)
TERRELL: What the hell is that?
CHEKOV: Botany Bay. ...Botany Bay! ...Oh no! We've got to get out of here now! Damn!
TERRELL: What about the...
CHEKOV: Never mind! Hurry! Hurry!
TERRELL: Chekov, what's the matter with you? ...Chekov!
CHEKOV: Come on! Hurry!
(outside they are confronted by a group of hooded figures)
[Reliant bridge] 
KYLE: Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell, ...this is Commander Kyle. Will you please respond, Captain? Captain Terrell, respond please.
BEACH: Let's give them a little more time.
[Cargo bay] 
CHEKOV: Khan!
KHAN: I don't know you. ...But you, ...I never forget a face, Mister ...Chekov. Isn't it? I never thought to see your face again.
TERRELL: Chekov, who is this man?
CHEKOV: A criminal, Captain, ...a product of late twentieth century genetic engineering.
TERRELL: What do you want with us? Sir, I demand...
KHAN: You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant ...nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and crew of the Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
TERRELL: Listen, you men and women, you have a...
KHAN: Captain! Captain! Save your strength. These people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he never told you the tale? To amuse your Captain? No? Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay, lost in space in the year nineteen hundred and ninety-six, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
TERRELL: I've never even met Admiral Kirk.
KHAN: Admiral? Admiral! Admiral... Never told you how Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
CHEKOV: You lie! On Ceti Alpha Five there was life, a fair chance.
KHAN: This is Ceti Alpha Five. ...Ceti Alpha Six exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste. Admiral Kirk ...never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On Earth, ...two hundred years ago, ...I was a prince, ...with power over millions.
CHEKOV: Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
KHAN: You didn't expect to find me. You thought this was Ceti Alpha Six! Why are you here? ...Why are you here? ...Why? ...Allow me introduce you to Ceti Alpha Five's only remaining indigenous lifeform. ...What do you think? They've killed twenty of my people, including my beloved wife. ...Oh, not all at once, ...and not ...instantly, to be sure. ...You see, their young enter through the ears ...and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex. This has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion. Later, ...they grow, ...follows madness. ...And death.
CHEKOV: Khan, listen to me!
KHAN: These are pets, of course. Not quite domesticated.
CHEKOV: Khan! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty!
TERRELL: No! No!
CHEKOV/TERRELL: (screams of pain)
KHAN: That's better! Now tell me ...why you are here? ...And tell me where I may find James Kirk.
[Space shuttle] 
ENTERPRISE VOICE: Enterprise to Admiral Kirk's shuttle. You're cleared for docking. Approach portside torpedo bay.
SULU: Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's party on final approach.
ENTERPRISE VOICE: Enterprise welcomes you. Prepare for docking.
KIRK: I hate inspections.
SULU: I'm delighted, any chance to go aboard the Enterprise.
KIRK: Well, I for one am glad to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't think these kids can steer.
[Enterprise docking bay] 
(an ensign sounds a bo'sun's pipe)
SPOCK: Open the Air Lock.
KIRK: Permission to come aboard, Captain?
SPOCK: Welcome, Admiral. I think you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
KIRK: Yes, we've been through death and life together.
KIRK: Mister Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
SCOTT: I had me a wee bout, sir, but Doctor McCoy pulled me through.
KIRK: Oh? A wee bout of what?
McCOY: Shore leave, Admiral.
KIRK: Ah. And who do we have here?
PRESTON: Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, sir!
KIRK: First training voyage, Mister Preston?
PRESTON: Yes sir!
KIRK: Well, ...shall we start with the Engine Room?
SCOTT: We'll see you there, sir, and everything is in order.
KIRK: That'll be a pleasant surprise, Mister Scott.
SPOCK: I'll see you on the bridge, Admiral. Company dismissed!
SAAVIK: (in Vulcan) He's never what I expect, sir.
SPOCK: (in Vulcan) What surprises you, Lieutenant?
SAAVIK: He's so ...human.
SPOCK: (in Vulcan) Nobody's perfect, Saavik.
[Enterprise engineering] 
KIRK: Well, Mister Scott, are your cadets capable of handling a minor training cruise?
SCOTT: Give the word, Admiral!
KIRK: Mister Scott, the word is given.
SCOTT: Aye sir.
McCOY: Admiral, what about the rest of the inspection?
KIRK: Later.
[Enterprise bridge] 
STARFLEET VOICE: This is Starfleet Operations. Enterprise is cleared for departure.
SULU: Admiral on the bridge!
SAAVIK (OC): Running lights on.
SPOCK: Very well, Mister Saavik, you may clear all moorings.
SAAVIK: Aye sir. ...All moorings are clear, Captain.
SPOCK: Thank you. ...Lieutenant, have you ever piloted a starship out of Spacedock?
SAAVIK: Never, sir.
SPOCK: Take her out, Mister Saavik.
SAAVIK: Aye sir.
SPOCK: For everything there is a first time, Lieutenant. Don't you agree, Admiral?
KIRK: Mmm.
SAAVIK: Aft thrusters, Mister Sulu.
SULU: Aft thrusters.
McCOY: Would you like a tranquilliser?
SAAVIK: Ahead one-quarter impulse power.
SULU: Ahead one-quarter impulse power.
(the Enterprise leaves Spacedock)
SULU: We are clear and free to navigate.
SAAVIK: Course heading, Captain?
KIRK: Captain's discretion.
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, you may ...indulge yourself.
SULU: Aye sir.
[Regula I space laboratory] 
DAVID: Does that about do it?
CAROL: I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
DAVID: Who'd wanna build it?
JEDDA: Doctor Marcus, Comm-pic coming in on hyperchannel. ...It's the Starship Reliant.
CAROL: On the screen, please, Jedda.
CHEKOV (on viewscreen): Come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is U.S.S. Reliant.
CAROL: Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
CHEKOV (on viewscreen): Ah! Doctor Marcus, ...good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
CAROL: En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?
CHEKOV (on viewscreen): Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha Six has checked out.
CAROL: Then I ...I don't understand why you're coming...
CHEKOV (on viewscreen): We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha Six.
DAVID: (and others) Who the hell, do they think they are?
CAROL: Will you please be quiet! Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular.
CHEKOV (on viewscreen): I have my orders.
DAVID: Pin him down, Mother. Who gave the order?
CHEKOV (on viewscreen): The order comes from Admiral James T. Kirk.
DAVID: I knew it! I knew it! All along the military has wanted to get their han...
CAROL: This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorised personnel access to our work or materials.
CHEKOV (on viewscreen): I'm sorry that you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.
[Reliant bridge] 
CHEKOV: Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
KHAN: Well done, Commander.
CHEKOV: You realise, sir, they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
[Enterprise turbolift] 
SAAVIK: Hold please! ...Thank you, sir.
KIRK: Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
SAAVIK: It is still regulation, Admiral. ...May I speak, sir?
KIRK: Self-expression doesn't seem to be one of your problems. ...You're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru.
SAAVIK: I failed to resolve the situation.
KIRK: There is no correct resolution. It's a test of character.
SAAVIK: May I ask how you dealt with the test?
KIRK: You may ask. ...That's a little joke.
SAAVIK: Humour. It is a difficult concept. ...It is not logical.
KIRK: We learn by doing.
McCOY: Who's been holding up the damn elevator?
SAAVIK: Thank you, sir.
McCOY: Did she change her hairstyle?
KIRK: I hadn't noticed.
McCOY: Wonderful stuff, that Romulan ale.
UHURA (on intercom): Admiral Kirk.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA (on intercom): I have an urgent Comm-pic from Space Lab Regula I for you, sir. Doctor Carol Marcus.
KIRK: I'll take it in my quarters, Uhura.
UHURA (on intercom): Aye sir.
McCOY: It never rains but it pours.
KIRK: As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
McCOY: Sorry.
[Kirk's quarters] 
CAROL (on viewscreen): Jim, can you read me?
KIRK: I can hear you, Carol. What's wrong? What's the matter?
CAROL (on viewscreen): Why are you taking Genesis away from us?
KIRK: Taking Genesis? Who's taking Genesis? Who is taking Genesis?
CAROL (on viewscreen): I can see you but can't hear.
KIRK: Carol!
CAROL (on viewscreen): Jim, did you give the order?
KIRK: What order? Who's taking Genesis?
CAROL (on viewscreen): Please help us. I will not let them have Genesis without proper authorisation!
KIRK: Have Genesis? Who gav...
CAROL (on viewscreen): On whose authority can they do this?
KIRK: No one's authority.
CAROL (on viewscreen): Please do something.
KIRK: Uhura! What's happening? Damn it.
UHURA (on intercom): Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
KIRK: Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
UHURA (on intercom): Aye sir.
KIRK: I want to talk to Starfleet Command.
[Regula I space laboratory] 
CAROL (OC): We must have order here. This has to be some sort of mistake.
DAVID: Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
MADISON: It seems clear that Starfleet never intended that.
CAROL: I that know, but...
DAVID: I've tried to tell you before. Scientists have always been pawns of the military.
CAROL: Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred. I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
JEDDA: You may be right, Doctor, but what about Reliant? She's on her way.
[Spock's quarters] 
KIRK (OC): We've got a problem. Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
SPOCK: If memory serves, Regula I is a scientific research laboratory.
KIRK (OC): I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but ...we're the only ship in the Quadrant. Spock, these cadets of yours, how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
SPOCK: As with all living things, each according to his gifts. Of course, the ship is yours.
KIRK: No, that won't be necessary, just get me to Regula I.
SPOCK: As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command the Enterprise. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer on board must assume command.
KIRK: It may be nothing, ...garbled communications. You take the ship.
SPOCK: Jim, you proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
KIRK (OC): You're about to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
SPOCK: I would not remind you of that which you know so well. If I may be so bold, it was a mistake for you to accept promotion. Commanding a starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
KIRK: I would not presume to debate you.
SPOCK: That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
KIRK: Or the one.
SPOCK: You are my superior officer. You are also my friend. I have been and always shall be yours.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Stop energisers.
SULU (OC): Stop energisers.
KIRK: Prepare speakers. ...An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, eighteen hundred hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course, for Space Laboratory Regula I. Engine room. Mister Scott!
SCOTT (on intercom): Aye sir.
KIRK: We'll be going to warp speed.
SCOTT (on intercom): Aye sir.
SULU: Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral.
KIRK: Engage warp engines.
SAAVIK: Prepare for warp speed.
SULU: Ready, sir.
KIRK: I know that none of you were expecting this. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have you to ask you to grow up a little sooner than you expected. Warp five.
SULU: So much for the little training cruise.
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN'S NAVIGATOR (OC): Course to intercept Enterprise ready, sir.
KHAN: Helmsman?
JOACHIM: Sir. May I speak? ...We're all with you, sir, but consider this. We are free. We have a ship and the means to go where we will. We have escaped permanent exile on Ceti Alpha Five. You have proved your superior intellect, and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk. You do not need to defeat him again.
KHAN: He tasks me. He tasks me and I shall have him. I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before I give him up. ...Prepare to alter course.
[Enterprise bridge] 
UHURA: Space Station Regula I. Please come in. Doctor Marcus. Please respond. This is Enterprise call... It's no use, there's no response from Regula I.
SPOCK: But no longer jammed?
UHURA: No sir. No nothing!
SPOCK: There are two possibilities. They are unable to respond. They are unwilling to respond.
KIRK: How far?
SPOCK: Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
KIRK: Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
SPOCK: It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was beyond the biblical reference.
KIRK: Uhura, have Doctor McCoy to join us in my quarters.
UHURA (OC): Aye sir.
KIRK: Mister Saavik, you have the con.
[Kirk's quarters] 
McCOY: Well, I've got the sick bay ready. Now will someone please tell me what's going on?
KIRK: Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
COMPUTER VOICE: Identify for retina scan.
KIRK: Kirk, Admiral James T.
COMPUTER VOICE: Security scan approved.
KIRK: Summary, please.
CAROL (on viewscreen): Project Genesis. A proposal to the Federation.
SPOCK: Carol Marcus.
KIRK: Yes.
CAROL (on viewscreen): What exactly is Genesis? Well, put simply, Genesis is life from lifelessness. It is a process whereby molecular structure is reorganised at he subatomic level into life-generating matter of equal mass. Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the laboratory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground. Stage Three will involve the process on a planetary scale. It is our intention to introduce the Genesis device into the pre-selected area of a lifeless space body, such a moon or other dead form. The device is delivered, instantaneously causing what we call the Genesis Effect. Matter is reorganised with life-generating results. ...Instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet, capable of sustaining whatever lifeforms we see fit to deposit on it.
SPOCK: Fascinating!
CAROL: (on viewscreen) The reformed moon simulated here represents the merest fraction of the Genesis potential, should the Federation wish to fund these experiments to their logical conclusion. When we consider the cosmic problems of population and food supply, the usefulness of this process becomes clear. This concludes our proposal. Thank you for your attention.
SPOCK: It literally is Genesis.
KIRK: The power of creation.
SPOCK: Have they proceeded with their experiment?
KIRK: Well, the tape was made about a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Stage Two by now.
McCOY: But, dear Lord, do you think we're intelligent enough to... Suppose, what if this thing were used where life already exists?
SPOCK: It would destroy such life in favour of its new matrix.
McCOY: It's new matrix? ...Do you have you any idea what you're saying?
SPOCK: I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create.
McCOY: Not anymore! Now we can do both at the same time! According to myth, the Earth was created in six days. Now, watch out! Here comes Genesis, we'll do it for you in six minutes.
SPOCK: Really, Doctor McCoy, you must learn to govern your passions. They will be your undoing. Logic suggests...
McCOY: Logic? My God! The man's talking about logic! We're talking about universal Armageddon, you green-blooded, inhuman...
SAAVIK (on intercom): Bridge to Admiral Kirk. Admiral, sensors indicate a vessel in our area, closing fast.
KIRK: What do you make of her?
SAAVIK (on intercom): It's one of ours, Admiral. ...It's Reliant.
KIRK: Reliant!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Try the emergency channels. ...Picture, Mister Saavik.
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Slow to one-half impulse power. Let's be friends.
HELMSMAN: Slowing to one-half impulse power.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU: Reliant in our section, this Quadrant, sir, and slowing.
SAAVIK: Sir, may I quote General Order Twelve, 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been established...
SPOCK: Lieutenant, the Admiral is well aware of the Regulations.
SAAVIK: Aye sir.
KIRK (OC): Is it possible that their Comm system has failed?
SPOCK (OC): It would explain a great many things.
[Reliant bridge] 
JOACHIM: They're requesting communications, sir.
KHAN: Let them eat static!
JOACHIM (OC): They're still running with shields down.
KHAN: Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us 'Revenge is a dish that is best served cold?' It is very cold ...in space.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: This is damned peculiar. ...Yellow Alert.
SAAVIK: Energise defence fields.
UHURA: I'm getting a voice message. They say their Chambers coil is overloading their Comm system.
KIRK: Spock?
SPOCK: Scanning. Their coil emissions are normal.
[Reliant bridge] 
JOACHIM: They still haven't raised their shields.
KHAN: Raise ours.
JOACHIM: Their shields are going up
KHAN: Lock phasers on target.
JOACHIM: Locking phasers on target.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SPOCK: They're locking phasers!
KIRK: Raise shields!
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Fire!
(explosions rips through the Enterprise)
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Sulu! Get Those shields up.
SULU: Trying, sir!
(scenes of chaos in engineering)
SULU: I can't get power, sir!
KIRK: Scotty! Uhura, turn off those damn channels!
UHURA: Mister Scott on the screen, sir.
[Enterprise engineering] 
SCOTT: We're just hanging on, sir. The main energisers out.
KIRK (on intercom): Try auxiliary power.
SCOTT: Aye sir.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Damage report.
SPOCK: They knew exactly where to hit us.
KIRK: Who? Who knew just where to hit us? And why?
SPOCK: One thing is certain, we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
KIRK: Visual! ...Sulu, divert all power to phasers.
SPOCK (OC): Too late.
KIRK: Hang on!
(the Enterprise bridge is hit as the Reliant circles)
KIRK: Scotty, ...what's left?
SCOTT (on intercom): Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes.
KIRK: We don't have a few minutes. ...Can you give me phaser power?
SCOTT (on intercom): A few shots, sir.
SPOCK: Not enough against their shields.
KIRK: Who the hell are they?
UHURA: Admiral! The commander Reliant is signalling. He wishes to discuss terms of our surrender.
KIRK: Visual on screen.
UHURA (OC): Admiral?
KIRK: Do it, while we have time.
UHURA (OC): On screen, sir.
KIRK: Khan!
KHAN (on viewscreen): You still remember, Admiral. I, of cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
KIRK: What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
KHAN (on viewscreen): Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life. But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you.
KIRK: Khan, ...if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. Spare my crew!
KHAN (on viewscreen): I make you a counter-proposal, I will agree to your terms, ...if, ...if in addition to yourself, you hand over to me all data and material regarding the project called ...Genesis.
KIRK: Genesis, what's that?
KHAN (on viewscreen): Don't insult my intelligence, Kirk.
KIRK: Give me some time to recall the data on our computers.
KHAN (on viewscreen): I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
KIRK: Clear the bridge.
SPOCK: At least we know he doesn't have Genesis.
KIRK: Keep nodding as though I'm still giving orders. Mister Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console.
SAAVIK: Reliant's command...
KIRK: Hurry!
COUNTDOWN VOICE: Forty-five seconds.
SPOCK: The prefix code?
KIRK: It's all we've got.
SAAVIK: The chart's up, sir.
KHAN (on viewscreen): Admiral!
KIRK: We're finding it.
KHAN (on viewscreen): Admiral!
KIRK: Please, please ... give us time, ...the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative.
KHAN: Time is a luxury you don't have, Admiral.
KIRK: Damn!
KHAN (on viewscreen): Admiral!
KIRK: It's coming through now, Khan.
SPOCK: Reliant's prefix number is one six three zero nine.
SAAVIK: I don't understand.
KIRK: You have to learn why things work on a starship.
SPOCK: Each ship has its combination code.
KIRK: To prevent an enemy do what we're attempting. Using our console to order Reliant to lower her shields.
SPOCK: Assuming he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent.
COUNTDOWN VOICE: Fifteen seconds.
KIRK: Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
KHAN (on viewscreen): Oh, I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
KIRK: I see your point. Stand by to receive our transmission. ...Mister Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command.
SULU: Phasers locked.
KHAN (on viewscreen): Time's up, Admiral.
KIRK: Here it comes. Now, Mister Spock.
[Reliant bridge] 
JOACHIM: Sir! Our shields are dropping!
KHAN: Raise them.
JOACHIM: I can't!
KHAN: Where's the over-ride? The over-ride?
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Fire! ...Fire!
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Fire! Fire!
JOACHIM: We can't fire, sir!
KHAN: Why can't you?
JOACHIM: They've damaged the photon-control and the warp drive. We must withdraw.
KHAN: No! No!
JOACHIM: Sir, we must! ...The Enterprise can wait. She's not going anywhere.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU: Sir, you did it.
KIRK: I did nothing ...except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mister Saavik, you go right on quoting regulations! In the meantime, let's find out how badly we've been hurt.
(Scotty stands in the turbolift doors holding the body of Midshipman Preston)
[Enterprise sickbay] 
PRESTON: Is the word given, Admiral?
KIRK: The word is given. Warp speed.
PRESTON: Aye.
SCOTT: He stayed at his post ...when the trainees ran.
SPOCK (on intercom): Admiral, this is Spock.
KIRK: Yes, Spock.
SPOCK (on intercom): Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
KIRK: Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out.
McCOY: I'm sorry, Scotty.
[Regula I space laboratory - exterior] 
SULU (OC): Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
UHURA (OC): Space Station Regula I, this is Starship Enterprise. Please, come in.
[Regula I space laboratory] 
UHURA (on viewscreen): Space Station Regula I. Do you read? ...Space Station Regula I, this is Enterprise. Please acknowledge.
[Regula I space laboratory - exterior] 
UHURA (OC): This is Enterprise. Do you read me? ...Space Station Regula I, do you read? Please come in.
[Enterprise bridge] 
UHURA: No response, sir.
KIRK: Sensors, Captain?
SPOCK: Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to ascertain what's inside the station.
KIRK: And no way of telling if Reliant is still in the area.
SPOCK: Precisely.
KIRK: What do you make of the planetoid beyond?
SPOCK (OC): Regula is class 'D'. It consists of various unremarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
KIRK: Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
SPOCK: A distinct possibility.
KIRK: Engine room.
SCOTT (on intercom): Aye sir.
KIRK: Mister Scott, do we have enough power for the transporters?
SCOTT (on intercom): Barely, sir.
KIRK: I'm going down there.
McCOY: Khan could be down there!
KIRK: He's been there, hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
McCOY: I can spare me.
SAAVIK: Begging the Admiral's pardon, General Order Fifteen. 'No flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
KIRK: There is no such regulation. ...All right, join the party. Mister Spock, the ship is yours.
SPOCK: Jim, be careful!
McCOY: We will!
[Regula I space laboratory] 
SAAVIK: Indeterminate life signs.
KIRK: Phasers on stun. ...Move out.
(a rat startles Bones. When he turns back, he bumps into bodies hanging by their feet)
McCOY: Jim! ...Well rigor hasn't set in. This couldn't have happened too long ago, Jim.
KIRK: Carol?
[Enterprise bridge] 
UHURA: This is Enterprise calling Space Lab Regula I. Respond please.
[Regula I space laboratory] 
SAAVIK: Admiral! Over here.
UHURA (on intercom): Doctor Marcus, come in please.
(Kirk opens a locker)
KIRK: Oh, my God!
[Enterprise bridge] 
UHURA: Please acknowledge signal. Please...
SAAVIK (on intercom): Commander Uhura, this is Lieutenant Saavik. We're all right. Please stand by. Out.
[Regula I space laboratory] 
CHEKOV: Oh, sir! It was Khan! We found him on Ceti Alpha V. ...He... He ...put ...creatures in our bodies to control our minds,...
McCOY: It's all right. You're safe now.
CHEKOV: ...made us say lies, ...do things. ...But we beat him. ...He thought he controlled us, but he did not. The Captain was strong.
KIRK: Captain. Where's Doctor Marcus? Where are the Genesis materials?
TERRELL: He couldn't find them. Even the data banks were empty.
KIRK: Erased?
TERRELL: He tortured those people. But none of those people would tell him anything. He went wild. He slit their throats. He wanted to tear the place apart, but he was late. He had to get back to Reliant in time to blow you to bits.
SAAVIK: Where is the Reliant crew? Dead?
TERRELL: Marooned on Ceti Alpha Five. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife.
KIRK: I know what he blames me for. ...The escape pods are all in place. Where's the transporter room?
[Regula transporter room] 
KIRK: Did he make it down here?
CHEKOV: It was not my impression. He spent most of his time trying to wring information out of the people.
SAAVIK: Anything?
KIRK: The unit's been left on. Which means that nobody remained to turn it off.
McCOY: Those people back there bought escape time for Genesis with their lives.
SAAVIK: This is not logical. These coordinates are deep inside Regula, ...a planetoid we know to be lifeless.
KIRK: If Stage Two was completed, it was going to be underground. ...It was going to be underground, she said.
SAAVIK: Stage Two of what?
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.
SPOCK (on intercom): Spock here.
KIRK: Captain Spock, damage report.
SPOCK (on intercom): Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
KIRK: I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
SPOCK (on intercom): The situation is grave, Admiral. We won't have main power for six days. Auxiliary power has temporarily failed. Restoration may be possible in two days, ...by the book, Admiral
KIRK: Meaning you can't even beam us back?
SPOCK (on intercom): Not at present.
KIRK: Captain Spock, if you don't hear from us within one hour, your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Starbase and alert Starfleet command as soon as you're out of jamming range.
UHURA (on intercom: Sir, ...we won't leave you behind!
KIRK: Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out. ...Well, gentleman can stay here, or...
TERRELL: If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd like to share the risk.
KIRK: Right! Let's go. ...Saavik.
McCOY: Go? Where are we going?
KIRK: Where they went.
McCOY: Suppose they went nowhere.
KIRK: Then this'll be your big chance to get away from it all.
[Regula I cavern] 
SAAVIK: Admiral...
McCOY: Genesis, I presume.
JEDDA: Phasers down!
DAVID: You!
(Kirk and David fight)
KIRK: Where's Doctor Marcus?
DAVID: I'm Doctor Marcus!
CAROL (OC): Jim!
KIRK: Is that David?
DAVID: Mother! He killed everybody we left behind.
CAROL: Oh, of course he didn't. David, you're just making this harder.
TERRELL: I'm afraid it's even harder than you think, Doctor. Please ...don't move.
KIRK: Chekov!
CHEKOV: I'm sorry, Admiral.
TERRELL: Your excellency, have you been listening?
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: I have indeed, Captain. You have done well.
DAVID: I knew it! You son-of-a-bitch!
(Terrell fires, vaporising Jedda)
TERRELL: Don't move ...anybody!
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Captain, ...we're waiting. What's the delay?
[Regula I cavern] 
TERRELL: All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis.
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: First things first, Captain. ...Kill Admiral Kirk.
[Regula I cavern] 
TERRELL: Sir, that it is difficult. I ...try to obey, but...
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Kill him.
[Regula I cavern] 
TERRELL: I...
KHAN (on intercom): Kill him, Terrell, now!
(Terrell vaporises himself. Chekov collapses)
McCOY: God's sakes! What is it?
(Kirk vaporises Chekov's Ceti eel)
KIRK: Khan, you bloodsucker.
[Reliant bridge] 
KIRK (on intercom): You're gonna have to do your own dirty work now. Do you hear me? Do you?
KHAN: Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive... my old friend.
[Regula I cavern] 
KIRK: Still, 'old friend'. You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Perhaps I no longer need to try, Admiral.
[Reliant bridge] 
DAVID: No! ...He can't take it!
KIRK: Khan! Khan, you have Genesis, but you don't have me!
[Reliant bridge] 
KIRK (on intercom): You were going to kill me, Khan. You're going to have to come down here! You're going to have to come down here!
KHAN: I've done far worse than kill you, ...I've hurt you. And I wish to go on ...hurting you. I shall leave you as you left me. As you left her. Marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet, ...buried alive. Buried alive!
[Regula I cavern] 
KIRK: Khan! Kahn!
[Regula I cavern] 
SAAVIK: This is Lieutenant. Saavik, calling Enterprise. Can you read us? ...This is Lieutenant. Saavik, calling Enterprise. Can you read us?
McCOY: He's coming around.
KIRK: Pavel?
SAAVIK: Can you read us? It's no use, Admiral, they're still jamming all channels.
McCOY: If Enterprise followed orders she's long since gone. If she couldn't obey, she's finished.
DAVID: So are we, it looks like.
CAROL: I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? ...Who is Khan?
KIRK: Well, it's a long story.
DAVID: We appear to have plenty of time.
KIRK: Is there anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
McCOY: How can you think of food at a time like this?
KIRK: First order of business, survival.
CAROL: There is food in the Genesis cave, enough to last a lifetime, ...if necessary.
McCOY: We thought this was Genesis.
CAROL: This? It took the Starfleet Corps of Engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there ...we did in a day. David, why don't you show Doctor McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food?
DAVID: We can't just sit here!
KIRK: Oh, yes we can.
DAVID: This is just to give us something to do, isn't it? ...Come on.
SAAVIK: Admiral?
KIRK: As your teacher Mister Spock is fond of saying, 'I like to think there always are ...possibilities.'
(Saavik leaves)
KIRK: I did what you wanted. ...I stayed away. ...Why didn't you tell him?
CAROL: How can you ask me that? Were we together? Were we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. And I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father. ... Actually, he's a lot like you. In many ways. Please tell me what you're feeling.
KIRK: There's a man out there I haven't seen in fifteen years who's trying to kill me. You show me a son that'd be happy to help him. My son. ...My life that could have been, ...and wasn't. And what am I feeling? ...Old. ...Worn out.
CAROL: Let me show you something ...that'll make you feel young as when the world was new.
[Reliant bridge] 
JOACHIM: Impulse power restored.
KHAN: Excellent! More than a match for poor Enterprise.
[Genesis cave] 
KIRK: You did all this in a day?
CAROL: The matrix formed in a day. The lifeforms grew later at a ...substantially accelerated rate.
McCOY: Jim! This is incredible. Have you ever seen the like?
CAROL: Can I cook or can't I?
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Where is she?
[Genesis cave] 
SAAVIK: Sir, may I ask you a question?
KIRK: What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
SAAVIK: The Kobayashi Maru, sir.
KIRK: Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now?
SAAVIK: On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I would really like to know.
McCOY: Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario.
SAAVIK: How?
KIRK: I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
SAAVIK: What?
DAVID: He cheated!
KIRK: I changed the conditions of the test. I got a commendation for original thinking. ...I don't like to lose.
SAAVIK: Then you never faced that situation, ...faced death.
KIRK: I don't believe in a no-win scenario. ...Kirk to Spock. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
SPOCK (on intercom): Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
KIRK: All right. I don't like to lose.
[Enterprise transporter room] 
SAAVIK: But the damage report? ...We were immobilised. Captain Spock said it would be two days.
KIRK: Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Spock! You remember Doctor Marcus.
SPOCK: Why, of course.
CAROL: Hello, Mister Spock.
McCOY: I'm taking this bunch to sickbay.
SAAVIK: By the book?
KIRK: By the book! Regulation forty-six A, 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
SAAVIK: '...no uncoded messages on an open channel.' ...You lied.
SPOCK: I exaggerated.
KIRK: Hours instead of days, Saavik, now we have minutes instead of hours.
[Enterprise corridors] 
SPOCK: They're inoperative below C-deck.
KIRK: What is working around here?
SPOCK: Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power.
KIRK: That's it?
SPOCK: Best we could do in two hours.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU: Admiral on the bridge.
KIRK: Battle stations. ...Tactical. ...Uh oh.
SPOCK: She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at one five three mark four.
KIRK: Scotty, can we make it inside?
SCOTT: The energiser's bypassed like a Christmas tree, ...so don't give me too many bumps.
KIRK: No promises. On your way.
SAAVIK: Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all that static discharge and gas clouds our tactical display. Visual won't function and shields will be useless.
SPOCK: Sauce for the goose, Mister Saavik. The odds will be even.
(the crew prepare the Enterprise for battle)
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: There she is! There she is! ...Not so wounded as we were led to believe. So much the better.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SPOCK: Estimating nebula penetration in two point two minutes. Reliant is closing.
KIRK: Steady as you go.
[Reliant bridge] 
JOACHIM: If they go in there we'll lose them.
KHAN: Explain it to them.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SAAVIK: That was close.
KIRK: They just don't want us going in there.
SPOCK: One minute to nebula perimeter.
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Why are we slowing?
JOACHIM: We daren't follow them into the nebula, sir, ...our shields will be useless.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SPOCK: they are reducing speed.
KIRK: Uhura, patch me in.
UHURA (OC): Aye sir. ...You're on, Admiral.
[Reliant bridge] 
KIRK (on intercom): This is Admiral Kirk. We tried it once your way, Khan. Are you game for a rematch? ...Khan! I'm laughing at the 'superior intellect'.
KHAN: Full impulse power!
JOACHIM: No sir! You have Genesis. ... You can have whatever you ...
KHAN: Full power, damn you!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: I'll say this for him, he's consistent.
SPOCK: We are now entering the Mutara Nebula.
KIRK: Emergency lights.
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Tactical!
JOACHIM: Inoperative.
KHAN (OC): Raise the shields.
JOACHIM: As I feared, sir. Not functional. I'm reducing speed.
(Enterprise passes above the Reliant at right-angles and starts to turn downwards)
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU: Target, sir? Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
KIRK: Best guess, Mister Sulu. Fire when ready.
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Aft-torpedoes ...fire!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Hold your course. ...Evasive starboard!
(Enterprise takes phaser fire from Reliant)
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Fire!
(Reliant suffers damage)
[Enterprise engineering] 
KIRK (on intercom): Damage, Mister Scott?
SCOTT: Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The radiation...
McCOY: Scotty!
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: Joachim!
JOACHIM: Yours ...is ...the superior...
KHAN: I shall avenge you.
[Enterprise bridge] 
CHEKOV: Could you use another hand, Admiral?
KIRK: Man the weapons console, Mister Chekov. ...Spock?
SPOCK: Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
KIRK: He won't break off now. He followed me this far, he'll be back. But from where?
SPOCK: He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates ...two-dimensional thinking.
KIRK: Full stop.
SULU: Full stop, sir.
KIRK: Zee minus ten thousand metres. Stand by photon torpedoes.
(Enterprise again passes above Reliant and circles to come up behind her)
CHEKOV: Torpedoes ready, sir.
KIRK: Look sharp. ...Fire! ...Fire!
(Reliant is hit and loses its port nacelle)
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant, 'Prepare to be boarded'.
UHURA: Aye sir. ...Commander, Reliant, this is Enterprise...
[Reliant bridge] 
UHURA (on intercom): ...Surrender and prepare to be boarded. Enterprise to Reliant, you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond. ...Reliant! Come in, Reliant. You are ordered to surrender your vessel.
[Enterprise bridge] 
UHURA: Enterprise to Reliant, you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond.
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: No, Kirk. ...The game's not over. ...To the last I will grapple with thee!
(Khan activates the Genesis device)
[Enterprise bridge] 
SPOCK: Admiral. Scanning an energy source on Reliant. A pattern I've never seen before.
DAVID: It's the Genesis Wave!
KIRK: What?
DAVID: They're on a build up to detonation!
KIRK: How soon.
DAVID: We encoded four minutes.
KIRK: We'll beam aboard and stop it.
DAVID: You can't!
KIRK: Scotty, I need warp speed in three minutes or we're all dead!
UHURA (on intercom): No response, Admiral.
KIRK: Scotty!
KIRK: Get us out of here, best speed possible!
SULU: Aye sir.
(Spock leaves the bridge)
[Enterprise engineering] 
(Spock arrives in engineering. Scott and an engineer are slumped on the floor)
McCOY: Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation that's in there!
SPOCK: But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
McCOY: You're not going in there!
SPOCK: Perhaps you're right. What is Mister Scott's condition?
McCOY: Well, I don't think that he...
(Spock administers a Vulcan nerve pinch on McCoy)
SPOCK: I'm sorry, Doctor. I have no time to discuss this logically. ...Remember!
SCOTT: Spock! Get out of there! Spock!
[Enterprise reactor room] 
SCOTT (OC): Spock! Get out of there!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Time from my mark.
SAAVIK: Two minutes, ten seconds.
KIRK: Engine room! What's happening?
[Enterprise reactor room] 
SCOTT: You dumb ninny! Get out of there! ...No, God, don't!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Time?
SAAVIK: Three minutes, thirty seconds.
KIRK: Distance from Reliant.
CHEKOV: Four hundred kilometres.
SULU: We're not going to make it, are we?
[Reliant bridge] 
KHAN: No! ...No! You can't get away. ...From Hell's heart, ...I stab at thee. For hate's sake I spit my last breath ...at thee.
[Enterprise bridge] 
CADET: Sir! The mains are back on line!
KIRK: Bless you, Scotty. Go, Sulu!
(Regula I explodes as Enterprise flees the radiating Genesis rings)
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: My God, Carol. Look at it. ...Engine Room. Well done. Scotty?
McCOY (on intercom): Jim, I think you'd better get down here.
KIRK: Bones?
McCOY (on intercom): Better hurry!
KIRK: Saavik, take the con.
[Enterprise engineering] 
McCOY: No! You'll flood the whole compartment!
KIRK: He'll die!
SCOTT: Sir! He's dead already.
McCOY: It's too late, Jim.
KIRK: Spock!
SPOCK: Ship ...out of danger?
KIRK: Yes.
SPOCK: Don't grieve, Admiral, ...it is logical. The needs of the many ...outweigh
KIRK: ...the needs of the few.
SPOCK: Or the one. ... I never took the Kobayashi Maru test ...until now. What do you think of my solution?
KIRK: Spock!
SPOCK: I have been ...and always shall be ...your friend. ...Live long ...and prosper.
KIRK: No!
[Torpedo bay] 
KIRK (OC): We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead. And yet it should be noted that in the midst of our sorrow, this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world, a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel that sacrifice a vain or empty one... and we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this. Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, ...his was the most ...human.
SULU (OC): Honours, ...hup!
(bagpipes play 'Amazing Grace' as the torpedo coffin is fired)
[Kirk's quarters] 
KIRK: Come.
DAVID: I don't mean to intrude.
KIRK: No, not at all. ...I should be on the bridge.
DAVID: Can I talk to you for a minute?
KIRK: I've poured myself a drink. Would you like it?
DAVID: Lieutenant Saavik was right. You never have faced a death.
KIRK: No, not like this. I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I tricked my way out of death ...and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. ...I know nothing.
DAVID: You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life.
KIRK: Just words.
DAVID: But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them. I was wrong about you and I'm sorry.
KIRK: Is that what you came here to say?
DAVID: Mainly. ...And also that I'm ...proud, ...very proud ...to be your son.
Captain's log, stardate 8141.6. Starship Enterprise departing for Ceti Alpha Five to pick up the crew of the U.S.S. Reliant. All is well. And yet I can't help wondering about the friend I leave behind. 'There are always possibilities' Spock said. And if Genesis is indeed 'Life from death', I must return to this place again. 
[Enterprise bridge] 
McCOY: He's really not dead. As long as we remember him.
KIRK: 'It's a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before. ...A far better resting place that I go to than I have ever known'.
CAROL: Is that a poem?
KIRK: No, no. Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
McCOY: You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
KIRK: Young. I feel young.
(the torpedo coffin lays in a clearing in the new, verdant forest on the Genesis planet)
Spock's Voice: Space, the final frontier. ...These are the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise. ...Her ongoing mission, to explore strange new worlds, ...to seek out new lifeforms and new civilisations. ...To boldly go where no man has gone before.
