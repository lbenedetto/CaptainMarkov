Star Trek III: The Search for Spock
(scenes from the end of "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.")
[Enterprise engineering] 
SPOCK: Don't grieve, Admiral, ...it is logical. The needs of the many ...outweigh...
KIRK: ...the needs of the few.
SPOCK: Or the one. I have been ...and always shall be ...your friend. ...Live long ...and prosper.
[Torpedo bay] 
KIRK (OC): We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead. This death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world, a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel that sacrifice a vain or empty one. Of my friend, I can only say this. Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, ...his was the most ...human.
SULU (OC): Honours, ...hup!
(the torpedo coffin is fired and lays in a clearing in the new, verdant forest on the Genesis Planet)
Spock's Voice: Space, the final frontier. ...These are the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise. ...Her ongoing mission, to explore strange new worlds. ...To seek out new lifeforms and new civilisations. ...To boldly go where no man has gone before.
OPENING CREDITS
[Enterprise bridge] 
U.S.S. Enterprise. Captain's personal log. With most of our battle damage repaired, we're almost home. Yet I feel uneasy and I wonder why. Perhaps it's the emptiness of this vessel. Most of our trainee crew has been reassigned. Lieutenant Saavik and my son, David are exploring the Genesis planet which he helped create. And Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone. No, more empty than even that. The death of Spock is like an open wound. It seems that I have left the noblest part of myself back there ...on that newborn planet.
KIRK: Status, Mister Sulu?
SULU: On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
KIRK: Very well, ...Mister Chekov, I'll need pre-approach scan. ...Take the science station, please.
CHEKOV: Yes sir.
KIRK: Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
UHURA: No sir, there is no response.
KIRK: That's very odd. ...Scotty, progress report?
[Enterprise engineering] 
SCOTT: I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Your timing is excellent, Mister Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out of here?
[Enterprise engineering] 
SCOTT: Eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Mister Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
[Enterprise engineering] 
SCOTT: Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
KIRK (on intercom): Your reputation is secure, Scotty. 
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
SULU: Aye sir.
TRAINEE FOSTER: Sir, ...I was wondering. ...Are they planning a ceremony when we get in? ...I mean, a reception?
KIRK: A hero's welcome, son? Is that what you'd like? ...Well, God knows, there should be. This time we paid for the party with our dearest blood.
[Merchantman bridge] 
CAPTAIN: Steady, ...steady boys. Keep scanning... I thought you people were reliable. ...Where the hell is he!
VALKRIS: He has been here for some time. Put me on the hailing frequency. Commander Kruge, this is Valkris. (in Klingonese) I have obtained the Federation data. Ready to transmit.
KRUGE (OC): Well done, Valkris, ...well done.
CAPTAIN: What the hell is...?
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Disengage cloaking device!
(the Bird-of-Prey decloaks)
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Lights up!
(Kruge has a fearsome pet at his feet)
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Transmit data. ...Now!
[Merchantman bridge] 
VALKRIS: (in Klingonese) Transmission completed. ...You will find it useful.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Then you have seen i?
[Merchantman bridge] 
VALKRIS: (in Klingonese) I have, my lord.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Unfortunate.
[Merchantman bridge] 
VALKRIS: (in Klingonese) Understood.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Thrusters!
[Merchantman bridge] 
CAPTAIN: What's the hell's going on? When do I get paid off?
VALKRIS: Soon, Captain, quite soon. (in Klingonese) Success, my lord ...and my love.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) You will be remembered with honour. ...Fire.
(the Merchantman is destroyed)
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) New course. Federation Neutral Zone. (about the pet) ...Feed him!
MALTZ: (in Klingonese) Yes, my lord!
(the Enterprise approaches Spacedock) 
[Enterprise bridge] 
UHURA: Approach control, ...this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
SPACEDOCK CONTROLLER (on intercom): Enterprise is cleared to dock.
KIRK: Lock on!
SULU: Systems locked.
KIRK: Spacedock, you have control.
SPACEDOCK CONTROLLER (on intercom): Affirmative, Enterprise. Enjoy the ride, and welcome home.
KIRK: Enterprise confirms.
[Spacedock control room] 
VOICE (OC): Acknowledge, door closed.
[Enterprise bridge] 
UHURA: Would you look at that?
(U.S.S. Excelsior on viewscreen)
KIRK: My friends, the great experiment. The Excelsior, ready for trial runs.
SULU: She's supposed to have transwarp drive.
SCOTT: Aye. And if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a wagon.
KIRK: Tut tut, Mister Scott. Young minds. Fresh ideas. ...Be tolerant.
(Commander Rand watches nostalgically from the Spacedock cafeteria)
COMPUTER VOICE: Enterprise, stand by for final docking procedure.
KIRK: Stand by umbilical and gravitational support systems.
SULU: Aye sir, moorings activated. ...All systems standing by.
CHEKOV: Admiral, ...this is not possible.
KIRK: Mister Chekov?
CHEKOV: An energy reading from 'C' deck ...from inside Mister Spock's quarters.
KIRK: I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
CHEKOV: Yes sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless I am reading a lifeform there.
KIRK: This entire crew seems on the edge of obsessive behaviour concerning Mister Spock.
UHURA: Sir! Security reports the door to Spock's quarters has been forced.
KIRK: I'm on my way. Sulu, continue docking procedure.
SULU (OC): Aye sir.
(Chekov says something in Russian to Scott about the security alert)
[Spock's quarters] 
McCOY: (in Spock's voice) Jim, ...Help me. ...You left me on Genesis. ...Why did you do that? ...Help me.
KIRK: Bones, ...what the hell are you doing? Have you lost your mind!
McCOY: Help me, Jim. ...Take me home.
KIRK: Bones, we are. We are home.
McCOY: Then perhaps it's not too late. ...Climb the steps, Jim. ...Climb the steps of Mount Seleya.
KIRK: Mount Seleya? Bones, Mount Seleya is on Vulcan! We're home, ...on Earth!
McCOY: (in Spock's voice) Remember!
UHURA (on intercom): Admiral, docking is completed. Starfleet Commander Morrow is on his way for inspection.
KIRK: Uhura! Get the medics down here! Get them now!
[Enterprise torpedo bay] 
MORROW: You've all done remarkable service under the most difficult conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendation, and more importantly, extended shore leave. ...That is, all but you, Mister Scott. They need your wisdom on the new Excelsior. ...Report there tomorrow as Captain of Engineering.
SCOTT: With all appreciation, sir, I'd prefer to supervise the refit of Enterprise.
MORROW: I'm afraid that won't be necessary.
SCOTT: But, sir...
MORROW: I'm sorry, Mister Scott, but there will be no refit.
KIRK: Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise is not...
MORROW: Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We feel her day is over.
KIRK: But we had requested... We'd hoped to take her back to Genesis.
MORROW: That is out of the question.
KIRK: May I ask why?
MORROW: In your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy. ...Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis. Consider it a quarantined planet, and a forbidden subject.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KIRK (on viewscreen): To fully understand the events on which I report, it is necessary to review the theoretical data on the Genesis device as developed by Doctors Carol and David Marcus. Genesis, simply put, is life from lifelessness. It was the intention to introduce the Genesis Device into a preselected area of a lifeless space body, a moon or other dead form. The device when delivered would instantaneously cause the Genesis effect. Instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet now exists, capable of sustaining whatever lifeforms we see fit to deposit on it.
KRUGE: So? Speak!
TORG: Great power ...to control, ...dominate.
KRUGE: Speak.
MATLZ: Impressive. ...They can make planets.
KRUGE: Oh yes, ...new cities, homes in the country, ...your woman at your side, children playing at your feet. And overhead, fluttering in the breeze, the flag of the Federation. Charming. ...Station!
MALTZ: Yes, my lord!
KRUGE: Share this with no one.
TORG: Understood, my lord.
KRUGE: We are going to this planet. Even as our emissaries negotiate for peace with the Federation, we will act for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
TORG: Success, my lord.
THE GENESIS PLANET
STARDATE: 8210.3 
[Grissom bridge] 
SAAVIK (OC): We have reached destination planet at point zero three five.
ESTEBAN: Very well, Lieutenant. Helm. ...Execute standard orbital approach.
HELMSMAN: Standard orbit. Aye sir.
ESTEBAN: Communications! Send a coded message for Starfleet Commander, priority one. ...'Federation Science Vessel Grissom arriving Genesis Planet, Mutara Sector to begin research. J.T. Esteban, commanding.'
COMM OFFICER: Aye sir, coding now.
ESTEBAN: Doctor Marcus, it's your planet.
DAVID: Begin scanning, please. ...This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
SAAVIK: Just like your father, so human. ...All units functional, recorders are on. Scanning sector one. The foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty-two point two Celsius.
DAVID: Sector two. Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
SAAVIK: Sector three. Sub-tropical vegetation. ...Temperature decreasing rapidly.
DAVID: It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
SAAVIK: Fascinating.
DAVID: All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
(console bleeps)
SAAVIK: Metallic mass.
DAVID: Close-range scan. ...A photon tube! ...Gravitational fields were in flux. ...It must have soft-landed!
ESTEBAN: In code to Starfleet. 'Captain's Spock's tube located on Genesis surface.'
COMM OFFICER: Yes sir, ...coding your message.
DAVID: I don't believe it.
ESTEBAN: What is it?
SAAVIK: If equipment is functioning properly, indications are ...an animal lifeform.
ESTEBAN: You said there wouldn't be any...
DAVID: There shouldn't be any.
SAAVIK: Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable lifeform reading.
COMM OFFICER: Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
ESTEBAN: Wait a minute! ...We don't know what we're talking about here.
DAVID: Why don't we beam it up?
ESTEBAN: Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state, 'nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated.'
SAAVIK: Captain, ...the logical alternative is obvious. ...Beaming down to the surface is permitted.
ESTEBAN: Yes, if the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger.
DAVID: Captain, please, ...we'll take the risk, but we've got to find out what it is.
SAAVIK: Or who.
[Kirk's apartment] 
KIRK: Absent friends.
SULU: Admiral, what's going to happen to the Enterprise?
KIRK: She's to be decommissioned.
CHEKOV: Will we get another ship?
KIRK: I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand and wait.
UHURA: Sir? About Doctor McCoy, how is he?
KIRK: He's home, resting comfortably, pumped full of tranquillisers. They say it's exhaustion. He promised me he'd stay put. Well we'll see.
(door chimes)
KIRK: Ah, Mister Scott. ...Come. ...Sarek! ...Ambassador, I had no idea you were here... I believe you know my crew.
SAREK: I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
KIRK: Please excuse us. ...Ambassador, I would have come to Vulcan to express my deepest sympathy.
SAREK: Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
KIRK: Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
SAREK: Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you. You denied him his future!
KIRK: I saw no future.
SAREK: Only his body was in death, Kirk. And you were the last one to be with him.
KIRK: Yes, I was.
SAREK: Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
KIRK: But ...why?
SAREK: Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence, with everything that was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us ...and bring that which he gave you, his katra, his living spirit.
KIRK: Sir, ...your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. Believe me when I tell you ...he made no request of me!
SAREK: He would not have spoken of it openly.
KIRK: Then, how was...
SAREK: Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind? ...He spoke of your friendship.
KIRK: Yes.
SAREK: He asked you not to grieve.
KIRK: Yes.
SAREK: The needs of the many ...outweigh...
KIRK: ...the needs of the few...
SAREK: ...or the one.
KIRK: Spock...
SAREK: I have been ...and always shall be ...your friend. Live long ...and prosper!
KIRK: No!
SAREK: Forgive me. It is not here. I had assumed he mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way ...when the body's end is near.
KIRK: We were separated! He couldn't touch me.
SAREK: I see. ...Then everything that he was. ...Everything that he knew ...is lost.
KIRK: Please wait! ...He would have found a way! If there was that much at stake, ...Spock would have found a way!
SAREK: Yes. ...But how?
KIRK: What if he joined with someone else?
[Electronic center] 
COMPUTER VOICE: Engine Room, Flight Recorder Visual. Stardate 8128.7 eight.
KIRK: Go.
(recording from Reactor room in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)
SPOCK (on monitor): Ship. ...Out of danger?
KIRK (on monitor): Yes.
KIRK: Back. Point seven seven.
COMPUTER VOICE: Flight recorder visual. Twenty-eight point seven seven.
KIRK (OC): Go.
McCOY (on monitor): No! You'll flood the whole compartment!
KIRK (on monitor): He'll die!
SCOTT (on monitor): Sir! He's dead already.
KIRK: Back. Point seven six.
COMPUTER VOICE: Flight recorder visual. Twenty-eight point seven six.
KIRK (OC): Go.
McCOY (on monitor): You're not going in there!
SPOCK (on monitor): Perhaps you're right. What is Mister Scott's condition?
McCOY (on monitor): Well, I don't think that he...
(Spock administers a Vulcan nerve pinch on McCoy)
SPOCK (on monitor): I'm sorry, Doctor. I have no time to discuss this logically.
KIRK: Freeze! ...Repeat ...and augment!
SPOCK (on monitor): Remember!
KIRK: McCoy!
SAREK: One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
KIRK: What must I do?
SAREK: You must bring them to Mount Seleya, ...on Vulcan. Only there can both find peace.
KIRK: What you ask ...is difficult.
SAREK: You will find a way, Kirk. ...If you honour them both, you must.
KIRK: I will. I swear.
[Grissom orbiting the Genesis planet] 
ESTEBAN (OC): Transporter room, stand by to energise.
HELM (OC): Aye sir. Energising now.
[Genesis planet surface - sub-tropical] 
ESTEBAN (on intercom): Grissom to Saavik. We're picking up radiation from the lifeform.
SAAVIK: Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
[Genesis planet surface - sub-tropical 
SAAVIK: I'll try to remember that.
(Spock's torpedo coffin has worm-like forms writhing over it)
DAVID: There are your lifeforms. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise. ...They were fruitful, and multiplied.
SAAVIK: But how could they have evolved so quickly?
DAVID: Saavik. ...What is it?
SAAVIK: Spock's burial robe.
(there is an earth tremor and a piercing cry)
[Starfleet officer's lounge] 
MORROW: No. Absolutely not, Jim, ...You are my best officer. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
KIRK: Don't quote rules to me. I'm talking about loyalty and sacrifice. One man who's died for us, another who has deep emotional problems.
MORROW: Now! Wait a minute! This business about Spock and McCoy. ...Honestly, I never understood Vulcan mysticism.
KIRK: You don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But even if there's a chance that Spock has an eternal soul ...then it's my responsibility.
MORROW: Yours?
KIRK: As surely as if it were my very own! Give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help I could...
MORROW: No, Jim! The Enterprise would never stand the pounding and you know it.
KIRK: Then I'll find a ship. I'll hire a ship.
MORROW: Out of the question, my friend! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis! Jim, your life and your career stand for rationality, not intellectual chaos. Keep up this emotional behaviour and you'll lose everything. You'll destroy yourself! Do you understand me, Jim?
KIRK: I hear you. ...I had to try.
MORROW: Of course.
KIRK: Thanks for the drink.
MORROW: Any time.
(as Kirk leaves he is joined by Sulu and Chekov)
SULU: The word, sir?
KIRK: The word ...is no. I am therefore going anyway.
SULU: You can count on our help, sir.
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Sulu. I'll need it.
CHEKOV: Shall I alert Doctor McCoy?
KIRK: Please. He has a long journey ahead of him.
[A cosmopolitan bar] 
WAITRESS: Long time, Doc.
McCOY: Yeah. ...Anybody been looking for me?
WAITRESS: I have, ...but what's the use? What'll it be?
McCOY: Altair water.
WAITRESS: That's not your usual poison.
McCOY: To expect one to order poison in a bar is not logical.
WAITRESS: Got it.
ALIEN: To your planet, welcome.
McCOY: I think that's my line, stranger.
ALIEN: Oh, forgive. I here am new. But you are known, being McCoy from Enterprise.
McCOY: You have me at a disadvantage, sir.
ALIEN: I name not important. You seek I. Message received. Available ship stands by.
McCOY: How much and how soon?
ALIEN: How soon is now. How much is where?
McCOY: Somewhere in the Mutara Sector.
ALIEN: Oh. Mutara restricted. Take permits many. Money, more.
McCOY: There aren't going to be any damn permits! How can you get a permit to do a damn illegal thing? Look, price you name, money I got.
ALIEN: Place you name, money I name. Otherwise, bargain, no.
McCOY: All right, dammit. It's Genesis. The name of the place we're going is Genesis.
ALIEN: Genesis!
McCOY: Yes, Genesis! How can you be deaf with ears like that?
ALIEN: Genesis allowed is not. ...It's planet forbidden.
McCOY: Look, my backwards friend! Genesis may be 'planet forbidden' but I'm damn well...
CIVILIAN AGENT: Sir, ...I'm sorry, but your voice is carrying. I don't think you want to be discussing this subject in public.
McCOY: I'll discuss what I like, and who the hell are you?
CIVILIAN AGENT: Could I offer you a ride home, Doctor McCoy?
McCOY: Where's the logic in offering me a ride home, you idiot! If I wanted a ride home, would I be trying to charter a space flight?
ALIEN: Aarrgh!
McCOY: How the hell do you know who I am?
CIVILIAN AGENT: Federation Security, sir.
(McCoy tries the Vulcan nerve pinch on the agent unsuccessfully)
CIVILIAN AGENT: You're going to get a nice, long rest, Doctor.
[Genesis Planet arctic] 
SAAVIK: Saavik to Grissom. We are definitely reading a second lifeform.
ESTEBAN (OC): We concur. Proceed with caution, Saavik.
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: What the hell is going on down there?
[Prison cell] 
GUARD #1: Make it quick, Admiral. They're moving him to the Federation funny farm.
KIRK: Yes, poor friend. I hear he's fruity as a nut cake.
GUARD #1: Two minutes.
McCOY: Jim.
KIRK: How many fingers do I have up?
(Kirk makes a Vulcan salute)
McCOY: That's not very damn funny.
KIRK: Your sense of humour's returned.
McCOY: The hell it has. What's that?
KIRK: Lexorin.
McCOY: Lexorin? What for?
KIRK: You're suffering from a Vulcan mind meld, Doctor.
McCOY: That green-blooded son of a bitch! It's his revenge for all the arguments he lost.
KIRK: Let me see your hand. This will make you well enough to travel.
[Prison outer office] 
SULU: Where's Admiral Kirk?
GUARD #1: With the prisoner.
SULU: Get him quickly. Commander, Starfleet wants him right away.
GUARD #2: Uuhh! (yawns)
SULU: Keeping you busy?
GUARD #2: Don't get smart, Tiny.
[Prison cell] 
GUARD #1: Admiral, ...Starfleet is....
KIRK: This man is sick! Take a look!
(Kirk punches the first guard and immobilises him)
SULU: The side elevator. Agents on their way up.
(Sulu throws the second guard and destroys the communications console)
SULU: Don't call me Tiny.
[Enterprise turbolift] 
KIRK: Unit two, this is unit one. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
CHEKOV (OC): Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
McCOY: You're taking me to the promised land?
KIRK: What are friends for?
(U.S.S. Excelsior in Spacedock) 
[Excelsior corridor] 
STYLES: Ah, Mister Scott. Calling it a night?
SCOTT: Yes sir.
STYLES: Turning in myself. Looking forward to breaking some of Enterprise's speed records tomorrow.
SCOTT: Ah, ah. Yes sir. Good night.
TURBOLIFT VOICE: Level please!
SCOTT: Transporter room.
TURBOLIFT VOICE: Thank you.
SCOTT: Up your shaft.
[Old City transporter station] 
UHURA: Roger. Old City Station at twenty-two hundred hours. All is well.
STARFLEET VOICE: Understood. All stations clear.
MR. ADVENTURE: You amaze me, Commander.
UHURA: Oh, how is that?
MR. ADVENTURE: A twenty-year space veteran, yet you sure choose the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place, this is the hind end of space.
UHURA: Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
MR. ADVENTURE: Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me, I need some challenge in my life, some adventure, ...maybe even just a surprise or two.
UHURA: You know what they say, Be careful what you wish for. You may get it.
KIRK: Good evening, Commander. Is everything ready?
UHURA: Step into my parlour, gentlemen.
MR. ADVENTURE: That's Admiral Kirk, my God!
UHURA: Very good for you, Lieutenant.
MR. ADVENTURE: But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded ID's.
UHURA: All true.
MR. ADVENTURE: Well, ...what are we going to do about it?
UHURA: I am not going to do anything about it, but you're going to sit in the closet.
MR. ADVENTURE: The closet? Have you lost all your sense of reality?
UHURA: This isn't reality. ...This is fantasy. You wanted adventure? How's this? The old adrenalin going? Good boy. Now get in the closet.
MR. ADVENTURE: Okay! Uh...
UHURA: Go on! Go on!
MR. ADVENTURE: I'll just get in the closet. Okay!
McCOY: I'm glad you're on our side.
KIRK: Can you handle that?
UHURA: Oh, I'll have 'Mister Adventure' eating out of my hand, sir. And I'll see all of you at the rendezvous. Oh, and Admiral, ...all my hopes.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SCOTT: As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Scott. I'll try not to take that personally. ...My friends, ...I can't ask you to go any further. Doctor McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
CHEKOV: Admiral, we're losing precious time.
SULU: What course please, Admiral?
KIRK: Mister Scott?
SCOTT: I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
KIRK: Gentlemen, ...may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
KIRK: Engage auto systems.
SCOTT: Aye, engaged.
KIRK: Clear all moorings.
SULU: Cleared, sir.
KIRK: One-quarter impulse power.
SULU: One-quarter impulse.
CHEKOV: Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
KIRK: No reply, Chekov.
CHEKOV (OC): Aye sir.
KIRK: Steady as she goes, Sulu.
[Style's quarters] 
FIRST OFFICER (on intercom): Yellow Alert! Captain to the bridge. Yellow Alert!
STYLES: Bridge, this is the Captain. How can you have a Yellow Alert in Spacedock!
FIRST OFFICER (on intercom): Sir, someone is stealing the Enterprise!
STYLES: I'm on my way.
[Spacedock cafeteria] 
STARFLEET VOICE: ...Alert! Yellow Alert! All stations, Yellow Alert! ...Yellow Alert! Yellow Alert! All stations, Yellow Alert!
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU: One minute to space doors.
McCOY: Are you just gonna walk through them?
KIRK: Calm yourself, Doctor.
CHEKOV: Sir, Excelsior is powering up with orders to pursue.
[Excelsior bridge] 
STARFLEET VOICE: Yellow Alert!
STYLES: Status!
FIRST OFFICER: All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
STYLES: Incredible machine. Helm, one-quarter impulse power.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU: Thirty seconds to space doors.
COMPUTER VOICE: Warning! Secured space-doors. ...Warning! Secured space-doors.
KIRK: And now, Mister Scott.
SCOTT: Sir?
KIRK: The doors, Mister Scott!
SCOTT: Aye sir. I'm workin' on it.
STARFLEET VOICE: Danger! Space-doors are closed. Danger!
(bleeping and the Space-doors open)
SULU: We have cleared space-doors.
KIRK: Full impulse power!
SULU: Aye.
[Excelsior bridge] 
STYLES: Stand by, tractor beam!
FIRST OFFICER: Tractor beam, on.
STYLES: If he tries to get away with warp drive, Ha, he's really in for a shock.
[Enterprise bridge] 
CHEKOV: Excelsior closing to four thousand metres, sir.
KIRK: Scotty, we'll need everything you have.
SCOTT: Aye sir. Warp drive standing by!
[Excelsior bridge] 
STYLES: Kirk! If you do this, you'll never sit in the Captain's chair again.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Warp speed.
SULU: Aye sir. ...Warp speed.
[Excelsior bridge] 
STYLES: Prepare for warp speed! Standby transwarp drive!
FIRST OFFICER: Transwarp at your command, sir!
COMPUTER VOICE: Full power available.
STYLES: Execute!
(U.S.S. Excelsior slows down)
COMPUTER VOICE: ...power available. ...Full ...pow-er ...av--ail--a---ble.
(TRANSWARP FACTOR display disappears and message 'GOOD MORNING CAPTAIN' appears)
COMPUTER VOICE: Transwarp drive maximum velocity in five, four, three, two, one...
(U.S.S. Excelsior slows to a halt)
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Scotty, as good as your word.
SCOTT: Aye sir. The more they over-think the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain. ...Here, Doctor, souvenirs from one surgeon to another. I took it out of her main transwarp computer drive.
McCOY: Nice of you to tell me in advance.
KIRK: That's what you get for missing the staff meeting, Doctor. Gentlemen, your work today has been outstanding. I intend to recommend you all for promotion, ...in whatever fleet we end up serving. Best speed to Genesis.
[Genesis planet surface - arctic] 
(Saavik and David find a young Vulcan)
SAAVIK: (in Vulcan) I am Saavik. ...Can you speak?
DAVID The Genesis Wave. His cells could have been regenerated.
SAAVIK: Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please.
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: Yes, Saavik, go ahead.
[Genesis planet surface - arctic] 
SAAVIK: We have found the life sign. It is a Vulcan child, perhaps eight to ten Earth years of age.
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: A child! How did he get there?
[Genesis planet surface - arctic] 
SAAVIK: It is Doctor Marcus' opinion that this is... That the Genesis effect has in some way regenerated ...Captain Spock.
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: Ah, ...Saavik, that's, ah, that's extraordinary. What would you like to do next?
[Genesis planet surface - arctic] 
SAAVIK: Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: Saavik Does Doctor Marcus think there could be any chance of, ...ah, ...radioactive contamination?
[Genesis planet surface - arctic] 
DAVID: No.
SAAVIK: None that he can detect, sir.
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
[Genesis planet surface - arctic] 
SAAVIK: I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
ESTEBAN (on intercom): Probably true, but let's do it by the book.
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: Stand by on this channel. ...Go.
COMM OFFICER: Starfleet Command, this is the U.S.S. Grissom on sub-space coded channel ninety-eight point eight. Come in, please. ...Sir, something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
ESTEBAN: Locate.
COMM OFFICER: Sir, it's from astern, Captain.
(Kruge's Bird-of-Prey decloaks)
ESTEBAN: Oh, my God!
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Gunner! Target engine only!
KLINGON GUNNER #1: (in Klingonese) Ready!
[Genesis planet surface - arctic] 
SAAVIK: Captain, what is happening?
[Grissom bridge] 
ESTEBAN: We are under attack! Stand by for evasive...
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Fire!
(the Grissom is destroyed)
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) I wanted prisoners!
KLINGON GUNNER #1: (in Klingonese) A lucky shot, sir.
(Kruge vaporises the gunner)
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Animal!
TORG: Sir, may I suggest.
KRUGE: Say the wrong thing, Torg...
TORG: There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
SAAVIK: (on intercom) Saavik calling Grissom.
KRUGE: Very good.
[Genesis planet surface - arctic] 
SAAVIK: Grissom! This is Saavik on emergency frequency. Come in please!
DAVID: Saavik. ...What happened to them?
SAAVIK: It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack. We must go. They will soon come after us.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU: Estimating Genesis two point nine hours, present speed.
KIRK: Can we hold speed, Scotty?
SCOTT: Aye sir, she's got her second wind now.
KIRK: Scan for vessels in pursuit.
MCCOY (OC): (In Spock's voice) Scanning. ...Indications negative at this time.
McCOY: Did I get it right?
KIRK: Great, Bones, ...just great.
[Genesis planet - sub-tropical] 
(Kruge using a scanner and two other crewmen)
[Genesis planet - arctic] 
SAAVIK: It's time for total truth between us. This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
DAVID: Not exactly.
SAAVIK: Why?
DAVID: I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
SAAVIK: Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
DAVID: But it was the only way to solve certain problems.
SAAVIK: So, like your father, you changed the rules.
DAVID: If I hadn't, it might have been years, ...or never!
SAAVIK: How many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done? ...And what is yet to come?
[Genesis planet - sub-tropical] 
KLINGON VOICES (OC): (in Klingonese)
(the Klingons have discovered Spock's torpedo coffin. The worm-like forms have grown enormously. Kruge stops a disruptor being drawn and wrestles with and kills a serpent which has evolved)
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Bridge, ...nothing happening here. Am resuming search.
[Genesis planet - cavern] 
DAVID: This planet is ageing in surges.
SAAVIK: And Spock with it. It seems they're joined together.
DAVID: They are.
SAAVIK: How long?
DAVID: Days, ...maybe hours. I'm sorry.
SAAVIK: It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
DAVID: I don't understand.
SAAVIK: Pon farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
(David's tricorder bleeps)
DAVID: Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
SAAVIK: I'll go.
DAVID: No! ...I'll do it. Give me your phaser.
[Enterprise bridge] 
CHEKOV: Sir, Starfleet calling U.S.S. Grissom. A warning about us.
KIRK: Response?
CHEKOV: Nothing. As before.
KIRK: What's the Grissom up to? ...Will she join us, or will she fire on us? ...Chekov, break radio silence. Send Captain Esteban my compliments.
CHEKOV: Aye sir.
KIRK: How are we doing?
McCOY: How are we doing? ...Funny you should put it quite that way, Jim. ...We are doing fine. But I'd feel safer giving him one of my kidneys than what's scrambled in my brain.
CHEKOV: Admiral, there is no response from Grissom on any channel.
KIRK: Keep trying, Chekov, at regular intervals.
[Genesis planet - cavern] 
(the planet trembles and the young Spock cries out)
SAAVIK: (in Vulcan) So it has come.
SAAVIK: It is called Pon Farr. ...Pon farr.
YOUNG SPOCK: (in Vulcan) Pon farr.
SAAVIK: (in Vulcan) ...Will you trust me?
(their hands touch as she conducts the ritual)
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU (OC): We are secured from warp speed... Now entering Genesis Sector.
KIRK: Proceed at impulse power.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
MALTZ: Vessel entering sector.
TORG: Yes. ...Federation Battle Cruiser. Have they scanned us?
MALTZ: Not yet.
TORG: (in Klingonese) Engage cloaking device.
[Enterprise bridge] 
CHEKOV (OC): I'd swear something that was there sir.
KIRK (OC): What did you see?
CHEKOV: For an instant ...a scout class vessel.
KIRK: Could be Grissom. Patch in the hailing frequency. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Please come in.
[Genesis planet - cavern] 
KIRK (on intercom): Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Do you read?
SERGEANT: (in Klingonese) Get up!
SAAVIK: Spock!
SERGEANT: (in Klingonese) Get up!
(Saavik and the young Spock are dragged to their feet)
KRUGE: I've come a long way for the power of Genesis. And what do I find? A weakling human, ...a Vulcan boy, ...and a woman!
SAAVIK: My Lord, we are survivors of a doomed expedition. This planet will destroy itself in hours. The Genesis experiment is a failure.
KRUGE: A failure! The most powerful destructive force ever created! ...You will tell me the secret of the Genesis torpedo.
SAAVIK: I have no knowledge.
KRUGE: Then I hope pain is something you enjoy.
SERGEANT: (in Klingonese) My Lord!
KRUGE: I ordered no interruptions.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
TORG: But sir! Federation starship approaching.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Bring me up!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Do you read?
[Genesis planet - cavern] 
KIRK (on intercom): Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Please come in.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Battle alert.
KIRK (on intercom) This is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Please come in!
KRUGE: Report status!
TORG: We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, five thousand kellicams.
KRUGE: Good. ...This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
[Enterprise bridge] 
CHEKOV: Nothing on my scanners, sir.
KIRK: Short-range scan, Mister Chekov. Put it on visual, Mister Sulu.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
MALTZ (OC): Range, three thousand kellicams.
KRUGE: Steady. Continue on impulse power.
MALTZ: Range, two thousand kellicams.
KRUGE: Standby to transfer energy to weapons ...at my command!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: There. That distortion. See it?
SULU: Yes sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
MALTZ (OC): Firing range, sir.
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Gunner! Target engine only. Understood?
KLINGON GUNNER #2: (in Klingonese) Understood clearly, sir.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Opinion, Mister Sulu?
SULU: I think it's an energy surge.
KIRK: Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
SULU: A cloaking device?
KIRK: RED ALERT, Mister Scott.
SCOTT: Aye sir.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
MALTZ: One thousand kellicams, closing!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: All power to the weapons systems.
SCOTT: Aye sir.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Wait! ...Wait.
[Enterprise bridge] 
McCOY: No shields?
KIRK: If my guess is right, they'll have to de-cloak before they can fire.
McCOY: May all your guesses be right.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
MALTZ: (in Klingonese) five hundred Kellicams!
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Stand by torpedoes. ...De-cloak!
[Enterprise bridge] 
SULU: Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes!
KIRK: Fire, Mister Scott!
KIRK: Good shooting, Mister Scott. ...Precautionary, Mister Chekov. Shields up.
CHEKOV (OC): Aye sir.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Emergency power to the thrusters!
[Enterprise bridge] 
CHEKOV: Sir, the shields non-responsive.
KIRK: Scotty?
SCOTT: The automation system's overloaded. I didn't expect to take us into combat, ya know!
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Fire!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Emergency power! Prepare to return fire. Mister Scott, can you transfer power to the phaser banks.
SCOTT: I don't think so, sir.
KIRK: What happened?
SCOTT: They've knocked out the automation center. I've got no control over anything!
KIRK: Mister Sulu?
SULU: Nothing sir.
KIRK: So ...we're a sitting duck.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
TORG: Ready to fire emergency tube.
KRUGE: Why haven't they finished us? ...They outgun me ten to one.
MALTZ: My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
KRUGE: Put him on screen!
KIRK (on viewscreen): This is Admiral James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
KRUGE: So! The Genesis Commander himself.
KIRK (on viewscreen): By violation of treaty between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, your presence here is an act of war. You have two minutes to surrender your crew and your vessel, or we will destroy you.
KRUGE: He's hiding something. We may have dealt him a more serious blow than I thought.
TORG: How can you tell that?
KRUGE: I trust my instincts. ...Admiral Kirk, this is your opponent speaking.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KRUGE (OC): Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: It is not I who will surrender, it is you! ...On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Who is this? How dare you take prisoners?
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Who I am is not important. That I have them is. ...I will allow you speak to them.
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
SAAVIK: Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
KIRK (on intercom): Saavik,...
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Is ...David with you?
SAAVIK (on intercom): Yes, he is. And someone else. A Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
KIRK: This ...Vulcan. ...Is he alive?
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
SAAVIK: He is not himself, but he lives.
[Enterprise bridge] 
SAAVIK (on intercom): He is subject to rapid ageing, ...like this unstable planet.
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
DAVID: Hello, sir. It's David.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: I'm sorry I'm late.
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
DAVID: It's okay, ...I should have known you'd come. Saavik's right, this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: David! ...What went wrong?
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
DAVID: I went wrong.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: David, I don't understand.
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
DAVID: I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'd kill us for it.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere, I shall kill one of the prisoners.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Wait a minute! Give me a chance to talk...
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Kill one of them. ...I don't care which.
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
(David fights with a Klingon who kills him)
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Saavik? ...David?
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
SAAVIK: Admiral, ...David is dead.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Klingon bastard! ...Klingon bastard! You've killed my son! ...You Klingon bastard!
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
KRUGE: There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too? ...Surrender your vessel!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: All right. All right, damn you! ...All right! ...Give me a minute to inform my crew.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: I give two minutes for you, and your gallant crew. ...Take every last man. Form a boarding party, armed heavily!
TORG: They outnumber us, my Lord.
KRUGE: We are Klingons! Once you control the ship, we will transfer our flag there, And take Genesis from their own memory banks!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird-of-Prey?
SULU: About a dozen officers and men.
KIRK: With some on the planet, ...I swear to you, we're not finished yet.
KIRK: Bones, you and Sulu to the transporter room. The rest of you with me. We have a job to do. ...Commander, Klingon vessel. Prepare to board this ship on my next signal.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: No tricks. ...I'm looking forward to meeting you.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) To the transporter room. Success!
[Enterprise bridge] 
KIRK: Computer. This is Admiral James T. Kirk requesting security access. Computer. Destruct Sequence One, code one, one-A.
SCOTT: Computer. Commander Montgomery Scott, Chief Engineering Officer. Destruct sequence two, code one one-A, two-B.
CHEKOV: Computer. This is Commander Pavel Chekov, acting science officer. Destruct sequence three, code one-B, two-B, three.
COMPUTER VOICE: Destruct sequence completed and engaged. Awaiting final code for one-minute countdown.
KIRK: Code zero, zero, zero, ...destruct zero.
COMPUTER VOICE: Destruct Sequence is activated.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Kirk, your time runs out.
[Enterprise transporter room] 
KIRK: All set?
SULU (OC): Aye sir.
KIRK: Commander, Klingon vessel. We are energising transporter beam. ...Now!
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Transporter stand by!
[Enterprise transporter room] 
(the Klingons replace the Enterprise crew)
[Enterprise bridge] 
TORG: My Lord. The ship appears to be deserted.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: How can that be? They're hiding!
[Enterprise bridge] 
TORG: Yes sir. But the bridge appears to be run by computer. It is the only thing speaking.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Speaking? Let me hear.
[Enterprise bridge] 
COMPUTER VOICE: Nine, ...eight, ...seven, ...six, ...five,...
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KRUGE: Get out! Get out of there! Get out!
COMPUTER VOICE: ...one...
(explosions rip through the Enterprise. Its crew on Genesis watch the fireball streak through the planet's atmosphere)
[Genesis planet - Kirk's landing] 
KIRK: My god, Bones. What have I done?
McCOY: What you had to do. What you always do. Turn death into a fighting chance to live.
SULU: Planet core readings unstable. Changing rapidly.
KIRK: What about surface life signs?
SULU: There!
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
SAAVIK: No, don't touch him!
(the rapidly maturing Spock hurls one the Klingons away. Kirk and the crew arrive and Kirk vaporises the other Klingon)
KIRK: Bones.
(while they gather round Spock Kirk discovers David's body)
KIRK: What happened?
SAAVIK: He gave his life to save us.
McCOY: Rapid ageing, ...all genetic functions highly accelerated.
KIRK: What about his mind?
McCOY: His mind's a void. It seems, Admiral, that I've got all his marbles.
KIRK: Is there anything we can do?
SAAVIK: Only one thing, sir. Get him off this planet. His ageing is part of what's going on around us.
(Kirk discovers a Klingon communicator)
KIRK: Klingon Commander, this is Admiral James T. Kirk. ...I am alive and well on the planet's surface.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KIRK (on intercom): I know this will come as a pleasant surprise for you.
[Genesis - Klingon camp] 
KIRK: Our ship was the victim of an unfortunate accident. Sorry about your crew, but as we say on Earth, ...'c'est la vie', ...I have what you want. ...I have the secret of Genesis. ...You're gonna have to bring us up there to get it. ...Do you hear me! ...I'm waiting for you! What is your answer?
(Kruge appears in a transporter beam)
KRUGE: Drop all weapons! ...Over there, All but Kirk. ...Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates.
KIRK: You should take the Vulcan, too.
KRUGE: No.
KIRK: But, why?
KRUGE: Because you wish it. (in Klingonese) ...Maltz! Activate beam!
(Sulu, Chekov, Saavik Scott and McCoy are beamed up)
KRUGE: Genesis, I want it.
KIRK: Beam the Vulcan up ...and we'll talk.
KRUGE: Give me what I want and I'll consider it.
KIRK: You fool, look around you! The planet's destroying itself!
KRUGE: Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
KIRK: If we don't help each other, we'll die here!
KRUGE: Perfect! Then that's the way it shall be!
(suddenly a huge rock erupts out of the ground and throws Kruge on to Kirk and they grapple)
KRUGE: Give me Genesis!
(Kirk breaks free, they fight, falling onto a lower promontory, part of which collapses with Kruge hanging onto to the edge)
KIRK: Give me your hand!
KRUGE: Kirk!
(Kirk then begins to kick the hanging Kruge)
KIRK: I ...have had ...enough of you!!
(Kirk kicks again and Kruge falls towards the red-hot lava below. He shoulders Spock's inert body and calls into the Klingon communicator.)
KIRK: (in Klingonese) Maltz! ...Activate beam!
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KIRK: Don't!
(Kirk has his phaser pointed at Maltz)
KIRK: How many more?
SCOTT: Just him, sir!
KIRK: Bones, help Spock! We've got to break out of orbit. ...You! Help us or die!
MALTZ: I do not deserve to live!
KIRK: Fine, I'll kill you later! Let's get out of here!
SCOTT: Where's the damn anti-matter inducer?
CHEKOV: This? ...No, this!
SCOTT: That, or nothing!
SULU: If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
KIRK: Go, Sulu!
(the Bird-of-Prey leaves orbit)
KIRK: Goodbye, David.
SULU: We are clear and free to navigate.
KIRK: Best speed to Vulcan. Mister Chekov, take the prisoner below.
CHEKOV: Aye sir.
MALTZ: Wait! You said you would kill me!
KIRK: I lied.
[Bird-of-Prey sickbay] 
McCOY: Spock. For God's sake talk to me! ...You struck this damn thing in my head, remember? Remember? Now tell me what to do with it. Help me. ...I'm gonna tell you something that ...I never thought I'd hear myself say. But it seems that I've missed you. I don't think I could stand to lose you again.
[Vulcan - temple area] 
UHURA: Ambassador, They are on approach. They're requesting permission to land.
SAREK: Permission granted. Tell them, ...tell Kirk we'll be ready.
[Bird-of-Prey bridge] 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, you're on manual.
SULU: It's been a while, sir. Here we go. ...Retrothrusters!
[Vulcan - temple area] 
(the Bird-of-Prey settles on the landing pad and with Sarek watching the crew appear bearing a stretcher with Spock on it)
UHURA: Sarek is waiting above, sir.
[Vulcan temple] 
PRIESTESS: (in Vulcan) Kal-tor kal-if-fah.
PRIESTESS: Sarek, ...child of Skon, ...child of Solkar, the body of your son breathes still. What is your wish?
SAREK: I ask for fal-tor-pan, the refusion.
PRIESTESS: What you seek has not been done since ages past, and then, only in legend. Your request is not logical.
SAREK: Forgive me, T'Lar. My logic is uncertain where my son is concerned.
PRIESTESS: Who is the Keeper of the katra?
McCOY: I am ...McCoy, ...Leonard H., ...Son of David.
PRIESTESS: McCoy, son of David, since thou art human, we cannot expect thee to understand fully what Sarek has requested. Spock's body lives. ...With your approval, we shall use all our powers to return to his body that which you possess. But McCoy, ...you must now be warned! The danger to thyself is as grave as the danger to Spock. ...You must make the choice.
McCOY: I choose the danger. ...Hell of time to ask.
(Spock and McCoy lie side by side with the Priestess between them)
PRIESTESS: (in Vulcan) Ben, wal, navu.
(the Priestess places her fingers on each forehead)
[Vulcan temple area - sunrise] 
(a gong is sounded and the High Priestess, Sarek and McCoy emerge)
McCOY: I'm all right, Jim.
KIRK: What about Spock?
SAREK: Only time will answer. ...Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is...
KIRK: What I have done, ...I had to do.
SAREK: But at what cost? Your ship. Your son.
KIRK: If I hadn't tried, ...the cost would have been my soul.
(Spock in a long, white, hooded robe is escorted from the temple. He turns and looks at each of the crew, finally Kirk)
SPOCK: My father says you have been my friend. ...You came back for me.
KIRK: You would have done the same for me.
SPOCK: Why would you do this?
KIRK: Because the needs of the one ...outweigh the needs of the many.
SPOCK: I have been ...and ever shall be ...your friend.
KIRK: Yes! Yes, Spock.
SPOCK: The ship. ...Out of danger?
KIRK: You saved the ship, ...You saved us all. Don't you remember?
SPOCK: Jim, ...your name is Jim.
KIRK: Yes.
(as Spock turns, McCoy taps his head and the crew gather round) 
...AND THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES...
