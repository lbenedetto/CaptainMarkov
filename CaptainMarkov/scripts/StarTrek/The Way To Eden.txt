The Way To Eden
[Bridge] 
(A small craft, which looks like a Tholian dart with small nacelles, is being pursued by the Enterprise) 
SPOCK: It is definitely the stolen space cruiser, Captain, the Aurora. I read six aboard. 
KIRK: Hailing frequencies. Aurora, this is the USS Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk commanding. Acknowledge. Aurora, this is the Enterprise. Do you read me? 
PALMER: They are receiving us, Captain. 
SPOCK: I read no evidence of malfunction. 
KIRK: Repeat. Federation orders to detain you for 
SULU: They're veering off, sir. 
KIRK: Change course. Pursue and overtake. 
CHEKOV: Aye, aye, sir. 
KIRK: Stand by tractor beams. 
SULU: Standing by, sir. 
CHEKOV: If it continues on course, it will enter Romulan space. 
KIRK: Engage. 
SULU: Tractor beam engaged. 
KIRK: Bring them in. 
SULU: They've not cut power, sir. They're struggling to escape. 
SPOCK: Their engines are seriously overheating, Captain. 
KIRK: Aurora, cut power. You are overtaxing your ship. 
SPOCK: Power approaching critical. They cannot continue. 
KIRK: Emergency power to tractor beams. Bridge to Transporter room. Scotty, are you ready to transport? 
[Transporter room] 
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. 
[Bridge] 
SPOCK: Power beyond critical. Explosion is imminent. 
(The little ship glows red) 
KIRK: Are we within transportation range? 
CHEKOV: Not yet, sir. 
KIRK: Aurora personnel, stand by to be transported aboard. Energise. 
(The little ship makes a big bang) 
KIRK: Are they aboard? Scotty, are they aboard? 
[Transporter room] 
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. They are, and a nice lot too. 
(Say hello to the 'space hippies') 
Captain's log, stardate 5832.3. The son of the Catullan ambassador is one of six we have beamed aboard from the stolen cruiser Aurora. We have been ordered to handle him with extreme delicacy, because the treaty negotiations now in progress between the Federation and Catualla are in a crucial phase. 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: Scotty, take them to the briefing room. 
IRINA [OC]: We are not in the mood, Herbert. 
CHEKOV: Irina? 
(The hippies are seated on the floor of the transporter room) 
MAN [OC]: Tell Herbert it's no go. 
ALL [OC]: No go. No go. 
KIRK: What's going on? 
SCOTT [OC]: They refuse, sir. 
KIRK: Why? 
[Transporter room] 
SCOTT: I don't know. They're sitting on the floor, the lot of them. You can hear for yourself. Shall I send for security? 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: No, I'll be right down. Mister Spock. 
ALL [OC]: No go, no go, no go. 
[Transporter room] 
ALL: No go, no go, no go. 
KIRK: Which one of you is Tongo Rad? 
(A purple haired lad with shaggy eyebrows stands up) 
KIRK: You can thank your father's influence for the fact you're not under arrest. In addition to piracy, you've left yourself open to charges of violating flight regulations, entering hostile space and endangering the lives of others as well as your own. 
RAD: I'm bleeding. 
KIRK: In addition you've caused an interstellar incident which may have destroyed everything that's been negotiated between your planet and the Federation. 
RAD: You've got a hard lip, Herbert. 
KIRK: If you have an explanation, I am prepared to hear it. 
(Rad sits down again) 
KIRK: Mister Spock, take them to Sickbay for a medical check. There may have been radiation from the explosion. 
SPOCK: Captain, with your permission 
KIRK: By all means. 
(Spock steps forward and makes a triangular sign with his hands) 
SPOCK: One. 
SEVRIN: (An older male with alien ears. Obviously the leader) We are One. 
SPOCK: One is the beginning. 
ADAM: (A red-headed youth) Are you One, Herbert? 
SPOCK: I am not Herbert. 
ADAM: He is not Herbert. We reach. 
SPOCK: If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we can arrive at a mutual understanding. 
SEVRIN: If you understand One, you know our purpose. 
SPOCK: I would prefer that you state it. 
SEVRIN: We turn our backs on confusion and seek the beginning. 
SPOCK: What is your destination? 
SEVRIN: The planet Eden. 
KIRK: That planet it is a myth. 
SEVRIN: And we protest against being harassed, pursued, attacked, seized and transported here against our wishes. 
ADAM: Right, brother. 
SEVRIN: We do not recognise Federation regulations nor the existence of hostilities. We recognise no authority save that within ourselves. 
KIRK: Well, whether you recognise authority or not, I am it on this ship. I am under orders to transport you back to Starbase peaceably. From there you'll be ferried to your various planets. Because of my orders, you are not prisoners, but my guests. I expect you to behave as such. 
ADAM: Oh, Herbert, you are stiff! 
KIRK: Mister Spock, you seem to understand these people. You will deal with them. 
SEVRIN: We respectfully request that you take us to Eden. 
KIRK: And after they are finished in Sickbay, see to it that they're escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they need. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SEVRIN: We respectfully request that you take us to Eden. 
KIRK: I have orders to the contrary. This is not a passenger ship. 
ADAM: Herbert, Herbert, Herbert. 
ALL: Herbert, Herbert, Herbert. Herbert, Herbert, Herbert. 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: Lieutenant Palmer, notify Starbase we have the six aboard who stole the space cruiser Aurora. Regrettably, the space cruiser itself was destroyed. 
PALMER: Aye, sir. 
KIRK: Personal note to the Catullan ambassador. His son is safe. 
CHEKOV: Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, what is it? 
CHEKOV: Sir, I believe I know one of them. At least, I think I recognise her voice. Her name is Irina Galliulin. We were in Starfleet Academy together. 
KIRK: One of those was in the Academy? 
CHEKOV: Yes, sir. She dropped out. She 
KIRK: Do you wish to see her? Permission to leave your post. 
CHEKOV: Thank you, sir. 
(Spock enters) 
KIRK: Are they in the Sickbay? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
(Chekov leaves) 
KIRK: Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists? 
SPOCK: Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man 
KIRK: Doctor Sevrin is their leader? 
SPOCK: Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies. 
KIRK: Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides. And they seek the primitive. 
SPOCK: There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created. It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound revulsion against the planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced atmospheres. They hunger for an Eden where spring comes. 
KIRK: All do. The cave is deep in our memory. 
SPOCK: Yes, that is true, Captain. 
KIRK: But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children. KIRK: What makes you so sympathetic toward them? 
SPOCK: It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar. 
KIRK: Spock. What does Herbert mean? 
SPOCK: It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought. 
KIRK: Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking. 
[Sickbay] 
(The teenagers are having an impromptu concert) 
ADAM: (playing a guitar without a sound box) Looking for the good land, Going astray. Don't cry, don't cry. Oh, I can't have honey, And I can't have cream. Gonna live, not die. Gonna live, not die. (Rad plays bongos) Stand in the middle of it all one day. I'll look at it shining all around me and say, I'm here, Iï¿½m here, In the good land. In the new land. I'm here. 
CHEKOV: Excuse me. Is Irina Galliulin with you? 
ADAM: She's getting her physical. Gonna crack my knuckles and jump for joy. I got a clean bill of health from Doctor McCoy. You know Irina? 
RAD: Say, tell me, why do you wear all those clothes? How do you breathe? 
(Chapel and two med-techs enter) 
CHAPEL: (to Sevrin) You're next. 
(The techs carry Sevrin into the next room. Chapel leaves and Irina enters) 
CHEKOV: Irina. 
IRINA: Pavel Andreievich. I had thought we might encounter each other. 
CHEKOV: You knew I was on the Enterprise? 
IRINA: I had heard. 
CHEKOV: Irina, why? Come. 
[Corridor] 
CHEKOV: How could you do this to yourself? You were a scientist. And now, look at you. 
IRINA: Look at yourself, Pavel. 
CHEKOV: Why did you do it? 
IRINA: Why did you? 
CHEKOV: I am proud of what I am. I believe in what I do. Can you say that? 
IRINA: Yes. Oh, we should not tear at each other so, Pavel. We should meet again in joy. Today when I first knew it was your ship that followed us, I thought of you and wondered what I would find. And I remembered so much. In spite of that uniform, I still see the same Pavel I used to know. 
[Rec Room] 
IRINA: Are you happy in what you do? 
CHEKOV: Yes. 
IRINA: Then I accept what you do. 
CHEKOV: You even talk like them. Why did you go away? 
IRINA: It was you who went. 
CHEKOV: I came back to look for you. I looked. Where did you go? 
IRINA: I stayed in the city, with friends. 
CHEKOV: You never felt as I did. Never. 
IRINA: I did. 
CHEKOV: You don't have it in you to feel so much. Even when we were close, you weren't with me. You were off thinking of something else. Why did you stay away? 
IRINA: Because you disapproved of me, Just as you do now. Oh, Pavel, you have always been like this. So correct. And inside, the struggle not to be. Give in to yourself. You will be happier. You'll see. 
CHEKOV: Go to your friends. 
(Irina leaves, and there is a commotion in the corridor.) 
[Corridor] 
ALL: Free Doctor Sevrin! Free Doctor Sevrin! We want to see him right now! 
ADAM: We want to see him now! 
(Chekov joins the security guards and Chapel trying to keep the kids out of Sickbay) 
[Sickbay] 
ALL: Herbert! Herbert! Herbert! Herbert! 
CHAPEL: I thought all the animals were kept in cages. 
KIRK: What's going on, Bones? 
MCCOY: Trouble. Your friend here didn't want a checkup. Turns out there's a reason. 
SEVRIN: I refuse to accept your findings. 
MCCOY: You don't have the choice. 
SEVRIN: They're the product of prejudice, not science. 
MCCOY: I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive planet, but assuming one did exist, I can tell you what would have happened had he settled there. 
SEVRIN: Untrue! 
MCCOY: There wouldn't have been enough primitives left to bury their dead. 
SEVRIN: Fantasy. Fantasy. 
MCCOY: I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim. Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it. Synthococcus novae. It's deadly. We can immunise against it, but haven't learned to lick all the problems yet. 
KIRK: Does he have it? What about the others? 
MCCOY: All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier. Remember your ancient history? Typhoid Mary? He's immune, as she was, but he carries the disease and spreads it to others. 
KIRK: Is the crew in danger? 
MCCOY: I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before boarding. Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too. But a regular programme of shots is necessary. I'll have to check everyone on the ship. There could be some skips. In the meantime, he should be placed in total isolation. 
SEVRIN: This is outrageous. You're not isolating me, you're imprisoning me. You invent a crime, find me guilty and sentence me! 
MCCOY: Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you? 
SEVRIN: No! 
MCCOY: Then why did you fight the examination? 
SEVRIN: It was an infringement on my rights. 
KIRK: Put him in isolation. 
(The two med-techs haul Sevrin away) 
MCCOY: Be ready for the objections, Jim. They are a vocal lot. 
KIRK: Yes, I'm ready. Kirk to Security. I want a guard maintained on Doctor Sevrin until further notice. Bones, how long before we know whether the crew has been endangered by this infection? 
MCCOY: It'll show in twenty four hours. It's a virulent strain. 
[Corridor] 
(Sulu is being chatted up by a brunette) 
WOMAN: You don't belong with them! You know what we want. You want it too. Come, join us. 
SULU: How do you know what I want? 
WOMAN: You're young. Think young, brother! 
SULU: You make it tempting. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu, explain. 
SULU: No explanation, sir. 
KIRK: Doctor Sevrin will be released when we think he is medically safe. 
ADAM: (singing) Stiff man putting my mind in jail. And the judge bang the gavel and say no bail. Gonna lick his hand and wag my tail. 
ALL: Herbert! Herbert! 
[Bridge] 
SCOTT [OC]: Engineering to Bridge. 
KIRK: Yes, Scotty, what is it? 
SCOTT [OC]: Captain, I just had to give one of those barefooted what do you call 'ems the boot out of here. She came in bold as brass, tried to incite my crew to disaffect. 
KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. Mister Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people. Do you think you can persuade them to behave? 
SPOCK: I shall make an attempt, Captain. 
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. If it weren't for that ambassador's son, they'd all be in the brig. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
Captain's log, stardate 5832.5. The arrogance of Doctor Sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation aboard the Enterprise. If it continues, Iï¿½ll be forced to use controls which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled with extreme tolerance. 
[Brig] 
SEVRIN: I have no influence over what they do. 
SPOCK: They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal. The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by criminals. If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred from Eden. 
SEVRIN: As I have been barred. 
SPOCK: Then you knew you were a carrier. 
SEVRIN: Of course I knew. You've researched my life. You've read the orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology because of what my body carries. 
SPOCK: What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders. 
SEVRIN: Because this is poison to me. This stuff you breathe, this stuff you live in, the shields of artificial atmosphere that we have layered about every planet. The programs in those computers that run your ship and your lives for you, they bred what my body carries. That's what your science have done to me. You've infected me. Only the primitives can cleanse me. I cannot purge myself until I am among them. Only their way of living is right. I must go to them. 
SPOCK: Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you know that. 
SEVRIN: I shall go to them and be One with them. And together we shall build a world such as this galaxy has never seen. A world. A life. A life. So now you're going to try to persuade me that your technologies will find a cure for me, and then I'll be free to go. 
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. 
SEVRIN: And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave so that they too will be allowed. 
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. 
SEVRIN: All right, you send them in. I'll talk to them. 
[Bridge] 
SPOCK: Doctor Sevrin is insane. I've not consulted Doctor McCoy, but I have no doubt of it. 
KIRK: I'll have Bones check him out. Spock, I'm sorry. You had great respect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done. 
SPOCK: His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary control? 
KIRK: Certainly. Mister Chekov, assist Mister Spock. Bridge to Sickbay. 
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy here. 
KIRK: Bones. 
MCCOY [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
KIRK: I'd like to talk to you. 
Captain's log, stardate 5832.6. I have asked Doctor McCoy to check Starfleet medical records to verify Mister Spock's suspicion that Doctor Sevrin is insane. In spite of Doctor Sevrin's antipathy to us, he has promised Mister Spock that he will order his disciples to conform to our rules and regulations. 
[Spock's quarters] 
SPOCK: Come in. 
ADAM: Am I crossing you? 
SPOCK: No. 
ADAM: I was just thinking, I (sees the lyre) Hey, brother, do you play? Is it Vulcan? Can I try it? 
(Spock gestures his permission and the young man strums a chord) 
ADAM: Oh ho, that's now. That's real now. I reach that, brother. I really do. Give. 
(He hands the lyre to Spock who plays it briefly) 
ADAM: Hey, how about a session, you and us? It would sound. That's what I came for. I wanted to ask, you know, great white captain upstairs, but he don't reach us. But would he shake on a session? I mean, we want to co-operate, like you ask, so I'm asking. 
SPOCK: If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes. 
ADAM: I'll spread the word. 
[Auxiliary control] 
IRINA: Am I allowed in? 
CHEKOV: Yes. 
IRINA: I have been looking for you, Pavel. What room is this? 
CHEKOV: Auxiliary control. 
IRINA: What's it for? 
CHEKOV: Should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage, we can navigate the ship from here. What do you want? 
IRINA: To apologise. I should not have teased you. It was cruel. 
CHEKOV: It does not matter. 
IRINA: Oh, but it does. It is against everything I believe in. 
CHEKOV: Let us not discuss your beliefs. 
IRINA: And I do not like having you angry with me, or disapproving. 
CHEKOV: Then why do you do such things? 
IRINA: What are you working on? 
CHEKOV: I am assisting Mister Spock in locating your Eden. 
IRINA: Oh, now you are teasing me. 
CHEKOV: I am not. These tapes contain star charts, and we project the orbits of the various planets here. By mathematical process, we determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet charted. 
IRINA: Do you know all these things? 
CHEKOV: What I do not know I find out from the computer banks. If, if I knew nothing at all, I could navigate the ship simply by studying what is stored in there. They contain the sum of all human knowledge. They solve our problems of navigation. Of control. Of life support. 
IRINA: They tell you what to do, and you do what they tell you. 
CHEKOV: No. We use our own judgment also. 
IRINA: I could never obey a computer. 
CHEKOV: You could never listen to anyone. You always had to be different. 
IRINA: Not different. What I wanted to be. There is nothing wrong in doing what you want. 
(Chekov gives in, and kisses her) 
SPOCK [OC]: I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat, I am not receiving. 
CHEKOV: I am sorry, Mister Spock. I was momentarily delayed. 
[Guest quarters] 
RAD: His name is Sulu, specialist in weapons and navigation. His hobby is botany. 
ADAM: Can? 
RAD: Can. I reach botany. It's my favorite of studies. What's yours? 
ADAM: Vulcan. Spock is practically One now. 
IRINA: Everything can be handled from auxiliary control. The computers contain all the information we need. We can do it. 
ADAM: It starts to chime. 
RAD: When will it? 
ADAM: Soon. Like he said now, we should all go out and swing as many as possible over. 
RAD: Can you suggest any special ways to swing them? 
ADAM: Just be friendly. You know how to be friendly. Then they'll be friendly. 
[Rec room] 
(Sounds are being laid down in a session and piped through the ship) 
ADAM: (singing) Iï¿½m talkin ''bout you, Iï¿½m talkin ''bout me. Long time back when the galaxy was new. Man found out what he had to do. Found he had to eat and he found he had to drink. And a long time later he found he had to think. Uh huh. Yes, think. I'm standing here wondering. 
ALL: What? 
ADAM: If a man tells another man out of my way. He piles up trouble for himself all day. But all kinds of trouble come to an end. When a man tells another man be my friend, uh huh. My friend. Well, what's it going to be? 
GIRL: (singing) There's a mile wide emptiness between you and me. 
(Spock arrives with his lyre) 
ADAM: Can't reach across it, hardly even see. 
GIRL: Someone ought to take a step one way or other. 
ADAM: (with chorus) Let's say goodbye, or let's say brother. Brother. Brother. Hey, out there. Hey, out there. Hey, out there. Hey, out there. I see you. I see you. I see you. I see you. Let's get together and have some fun. I don't know how to do it but it's got to be done. 
(Then Spock plays, accompanied by a girl playing what looks like a wire-spoked wheel) 
(In the Brig, Rad climbs up a ladder and uses pressure points to knock out the guard. Then he releases Sevrin from his cell) 
[Bridge] 
(Many of the crew are moving to the beat) 
SCOTT: At least we know where they are and what they're doing. I don't know why a young mind has to be an undisciplined one. They're troublemakers. 
KIRK: I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty. Didn't you? 
(Rad takes out the man on duty in Auxiliary control, then he and Sevrin sit down and start changing things) 
SULU: Captain, I get no response from controls. We're going off course. 
SCOTT: It's shorted. No, it's channeled over somewhere. To auxiliary control. 
KIRK: Bridge to auxiliary control. Bridge to auxiliary control. 
SULU: Captain, it seems as though someone else is running the ship. 
SEVRIN [OC]: That's right, someone else is running this ship. 
[Auxiliary control] 
(All his followers are there now) 
SEVRIN: I am. All functions, life support as well. You cannot interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the control room. 
[Bridge] 
SEVRIN [OC]: I do not intend to hand over the helm to you until and unless we reach Eden. 
[Auxiliary control] 
SEVRIN: If I am in any way prevented from reaching that destination, I shall destroy this ship and all aboard. 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: Can he do it? 
SPOCK: He has the capability, Captain. 
[Auxiliary control] 
SCOTT [OC]: Heï¿½s got everything channelled over. 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: Start a trace-back of all circuits. 
[Auxiliary control] 
KIRK [OC]: See if you can bypass him. 
SEVRIN: Do that, and I shall retaliate. 
[Bridge] 
SEVRIN [OC]: I shall not warn you again. 
SULU: Captain, we're now leaving the Neutral Zone. Bearing into Romulan space! 
KIRK: Any patrols? 
SPOCK: Negative. 
KIRK: There will be soon. Doctor Sevrin. You are violating Romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy. 
[Auxiliary control] 
KIRK [OC]: The Romulans will view this as a military intrusion and attack. Bring the ship about now. If you bring her about 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: And return to Starbase, no charges will be leveled. 
[Auxiliary control] 
ADAM: Like you said, Brother Sevrin. 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: If you do not, you will never reach Eden. You and this ship will be destroyed. 
ADAM [OC]: He's got jelly in the belly. Real scared. 
KIRK: Adam. 
[Auxiliary control] 
KIRK [OC]: Rad. 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: You are being led by a man who is insane. 
[Auxiliary control] 
KIRK [OC]: You are being used by him. 
[Bridge] 
KIRK: Spock, you tell them. 
SPOCK: Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In it you'll find a report attesting to the fact 
[Auxiliary control] 
SPOCK: That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae. 
ADAM: (sarcastic) Ain't that just awful. 
[Bridge] 
SPOCK: You'll also find a report from the same hospital, giving a full psychological profile on him and projecting these actions of his. 
[Auxiliary control] 
ADAM: Yay, brother. 
[Bridge] 
SPOCK: Adam. You know I reach you. I believe in what you seek. But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants. 
[Auxiliary control] 
ADAM: You're making me cry. 
RAD: There it is. They've established Eden, Brother Sevrin. 
IRINA: Pavel said they would. Our original course must have been somewhat in error. 
SEVRIN: When will we get there? 
RAD: At this speed, three hours. 
SEVRIN: They'll try to persuade us to change course presently and then they'll attack. 
RAD: How do you plan to stop them? By cutting off their life support? 
SEVRIN: I have another weapon. Take control, Brother Rad. 
(Sevrin takes the cover off a wall access point) 
ADAM: What are you doing? 
SEVRIN: Making an adjustment on their circuits. 
ADAM: (singing) Headin' out to Eden. Yea, brother. Headin' out to Eden. No more trouble in my body or my mind. Gonna live like a king on whatever I find, Eat all the fruit and throw away the rind. Yea, brother. Yea. 
[Bridge] 
SPOCK: We are within sensor range of Eden and continuing to approach. 
KIRK: Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now. We have no choice. Mister Spock, Mister Scott. 
[Auxiliary control] 
ADAM: When will you use that? 
SEVRIN: At the proper time. Let me know when we're in orbit. 
RAD: Approaching right on the dot, just as they plotted it, Brother Sevrin. 
IRINA: What will that do to them? What is it? 
SEVRIN: Well, I'm using sound against them, beyond the ultrasonic. It will stun them and allow us time to leave. We'll go in one of their shuttlecraft. 
IRINA: Sound pitched that high doesn't stun, it destroys. I remember when we read in the text that it 
SEVRIN: I've gone beyond those texts, Irina. It's correct for you to be concerned, but be assured also. 
RAD: We are in orbit over Eden, Brother Sevrin. It does destroy. 
SEVRIN: We cannot allow them to come after us. It will not reach us in here. I can control it all. I have adjusted it so that it will suspend its effects after a few moments and allow us time to escape. Then, after we've gone, it will automatically reactivate. Rejoice, brethren. Soon we shall step together into Eden. 
(A flame appears in the wall behind them) 
[Corridor] 
(Scott is trying to cut into the room with a phaser. Sevrin turns on his sonic weapon and Spock is instantly stricken with pain) 
KIRK: Spock! It's all right, Spock. It stopped. 
SPOCK: No, Captain, it hasn't stopped. It has gone beyond 
(Now it affects Kirk. Scott is already unconscious) 
SPOCK: Captain, they're using 
(All over the ship, people fall to the floor) 
[Auxiliary control] 
ADAM: Steppin' into Eden. Yea, brother. Steppin' into Eden. Yea, brother. No more trouble in my body or my mind. Gonna live like a king on whatever find. Eat all the fruit and throw away the rind. Yea, brother. 
SEVRIN: Now we may leave. 
[Corridor] 
(Scott, Kirk and Spock are waking up) 
SPOCK: (in pain) Captain, go. I. You must destroy the 
KIRK: What is it? 
SPOCK: Ultrasonics. The panel. 
[Auxiliary control] 
(Kirk staggers into the room and turns off the sound) 
KIRK: Kirk to Engineering. Bridge? Hangar deck? Kirk to Transporter Room. Kirk to Bridge. Do you read me? Come in. 
SULU [OC]: Sulu here, Captain. What happened to us? I heard a whistle, and then 
KIRK: Never mind. Do we have control of the ship? 
CHEKOV [OC]: No, sir. Control is in auxiliary. 
KIRK: Can we break out of orbit if we have to? 
SULU: I think so, sir. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Hangar Deck to Captain. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
CREWMAN: Sir, one of the shuttlecrafts has been taken. We were all knocked out. 
KIRK: Stand by. Do you read any Romulans? 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. However I am picking up the shuttlecraft. 
KIRK: Where? 
SPOCK: It has landed. Except for those aboard the craft, I read no life at all, either humanoid nor animal. 
KIRK: Auxiliary control to Doctor McCoy. Bones, are you all right? 
MCCOY [OC]: Yes, Jim. 
KIRK: Stand by, transporter room. Full medical gear. 
CHEKOV [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. Do you wish to open communication, sir? 
KIRK: No. No, they tried to destroy us. Let them think they succeeded. I want the co-ordinates zeroed in so that when we beam down, we won't be visible to them. Scotty, you have the conn. If any Romulans appear, try to make them understand. I do not want to provoke combat. Mister Spock. Mister Chekov, join us in the transporter room. 
[Planet surface] 
(Looking remarkable like Miramanee's planet, right down to the lake. Or maybe the Pleasure Planet?) 
SPOCK: The legends were true, Captain. Fantastically beautiful planet. 
CHEKOV: Eden. 
KIRK: Is this what they believed they'd find? Then I can understand. Spread out. Approach with caution. (into communicator) Doctor Sevrin. 
(Chekov screams) 
KIRK: What is it? 
CHEKOV: The flower, sir. I touched it. It's like fire. 
(His palm is covered in blisters) 
MCCOY: It's burned. All this plant life is full of acid. Even the grass, Jim. 
KIRK: Will our clothing protect us? 
MCCOY: It should for a while. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
(Our young minstrel is spread out on the ground, a half-eaten fruit beside him) 
KIRK: Bones? 
MCCOY: Poison. The fruit is deadly. 
SPOCK: His name was Adam. 
KIRK: There's the shuttlecraft. 
[By the Galileo II] 
(The door opens. The hippies have blisters on their feet and can't walk. Kirk picks up Irina and carries her) 
KIRK: Here, we'll help you. 
(The youngsters come out, and finally Sevrin) 
KIRK: Doctor Sevrin. Bones! 
MCCOY: He should be beamed aboard, Jim. He needs more than I can do for him here. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. 
SCOTT [OC]: Enterprise here. 
SPOCK: Stand by to beam aboard injured parties. Medical team to the transporter room. 
SEVRIN: No, we're not leaving. 
KIRK: We can help you aboard the ship. 
SEVRIN: We're not leaving Eden, none of us. 
KIRK: Be sensible, Doctor. 
SEVRIN: We're not leaving. 
(Sevrin runs off on his blistered feet and climbs a fruit tree) 
MCCOY: Come back here, you fool! 
KIRK: Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself! 
MCCOY: Don't bite into that! 
KIRK: Stop! 
(But man takes a bite of the forbidden fruit, and loses Eden forever) 
IRINA: It was so beautiful. 
[Bridge] 
PALMER: I have Starbase now, Captain. 
KIRK: Alert them that we have the four and we're ready to beam them down. And mark the incident closed. 
PALMER: Aye, sir. 
KIRK: Bridge to Transporter. Scotty, are they there? 
SCOTT [OC]: Three of them, sir. Expecting a fourth any minute. 
KIRK: Stand by. Mister Chekov, do you wish to attend? 
CHEKOV: Captain, I wish first to apologise for my conduct during this time. I did not maintain myself under proper discipline. I endangered the ship and its personnel by my conduct. I respectfully submit myself for disciplinary action. 
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Chekov. You did what you had to do. As did we all. Even your friends. You may go. 
CHEKOV: Thank you, sir. 
(Irina enters) 
CHEKOV: I was coming to say goodbye. 
IRINA: And I was coming to say goodbye to you. (a kiss) Be incorrect, occasionally. 
CHEKOV: And you be correct. 
IRINA: Occasionally. 
SPOCK: Miss Galliulin. It is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden. I have no doubt but that you will find it, or make it yourselves. 
IRINA: Thank you. 
(Irina leaves) 
KIRK: We reach, Mister Spock.
