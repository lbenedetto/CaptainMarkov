Equinox - Part 2
[Bridge] 
(Janeway gets knocked down, then Chakotay.) 
JANEWAY: Give me tactical control. 
(The aliens disappear.)
JANEWAY: Good guess. I used a deflector pulse to reinforce the shields. It won't hold for long. 
(Chakotay got a fleeting touch of the alien.)
PARIS: Bridge to Sickbay. We have a medical emergency. Doctor, respond. Ensign. 
ENSIGN: Yes, sir. 
KIM: Casualty reports are coming in. Two dead, thirteen wounded. We took heavy damage to the engines. 
JANEWAY: The Equinox? 
KIM: They've gone to warp. 
JANEWAY: Any sign of nucleogenic particles? 
KIM: No. 
JANEWAY: Then they haven't engaged their enhanced warp drive yet. Keep looking for 
(The sound of new fissures opening.) 
[Equinox Bridge] 
RANSOM: Report. 
BURKE: The shield grid is back in place. The aliens are staying clear. 
RANSOM: Are sensors picking up Voyager? 
LESSING: It looks like they're under attack. 
RANSOM: Maintain course. 
[Corridor] 
(Janeway and her escort are all armed with big phaser rifles. They split up at a junction, and Janeway finds a dead alien around the corner.)
NEELIX: Captain, I found the Doctor's mobile emitter on deck nine. You might want to take it to Sickbay. 
[Sickbay] 
(There are so many injured crew that they are having to lie on the deck, with a blanket. Paris records another death, then goes to Chakotay.)
PARIS: Any sign of the Doc? 
JANEWAY: I've got him right here. 
(She downloads the programme from the mobile emitter.)
E-EMH: Please state the nature of the. Don't bother. 
PARIS: You should start with Chakotay. I've got him stabilised but he's got internal injuries. 
JANEWAY: We found your emitter on deck nine. 
E-EMH: I was taken hostage by the Equinox crew. I deactivated myself to escape. Did you stop them? 
JANEWAY: No. 
CHAKOTAY: I'd ask for a status report but I'm not sure I'd want to hear it. 
JANEWAY: Harry's analysing the sound we've been hearing. He thinks it's some form of communication. 
CHAKOTAY: Well, I once figured out how to speak with a Terrelian seapod. This couldn't be that much harder, Once I get out of Sickbay, I'll lend him a hand. 
JANEWAY: We should all be focusing our efforts on finding the Equinox. 
CHAKOTAY: First things first. We've got to stop these attacks. 
JANEWAY: Our enemies aren't the aliens. They're the humans aboard the Equinox. It's crucial that you don't
(The sound of a fissure.) 
[Equinox - Ransom's Quarters] 
(The doorbell interrupts Ransom's enjoyment of a rocky coastline via his synaptic stimulator.)
RANSOM: Who is it? 
BURKE [OC]: It's Max. I've brought you a visitor. 
RANSOM: Hold on. Come in. 
(Burke enters with Seven.) 
RANSOM: I'm glad you're okay. I've been using this synaptic stimulator. I was just taking a stroll along the Tenkaran coast. You're welcome to try it. 
SEVEN: State your intentions. 
RANSOM: You know, once we get our enhanced warp drive back online, we'll be on our way home, but it'll still take months to get there. You can spend that time in the brig, or you can become part of this crew. I'd prefer the latter. 
SEVEN: I'd prefer the brig. 
RANSOM: You know, Janeway's not the only Captain who can help you explore your humanity. 
SEVEN: You would be an inferior role model. 
RANSOM: Janeway clung to her morality at the expense of her crew. Maybe you should learn from that mistake. 
SEVEN: Her only mistake was trusting you. 
RANSOM: Take care of her wound. 
[Equinox Sickbay] 
BURKE: First degree phaser burns, minor lacerations. Looks like we'll have to amputate. That was a joke. You're supposed to smile and make a witty retort. 
SEVEN: I'm familiar with human banter. Yours is crude and predictable. 
BURKE: You know, Seven. Can I call you Seven? We don't have many luxuries around here. All we've got is each other. You might try letting your shields down or else it's going to be a lonely trip. I'll be damned. Looks like our Doctor left us a replacement. 
EMH: Seven? 
SEVEN: We are captives. 
EMH: I was attacked by their EMH. 
BURKE: Looks like he downloaded you into our database. Good. You can treat your friend. 
[Equinox Engineering] 
THOMPSON: Priming the injectors. 
GILMORE: Marla to Bridge. 
RANSOM: Go ahead. 
GILMORE: We're ready. 
RANSOM [OC]: Acknowledged. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
RANSOM: Infuse the enhanced warp drive with twenty isograms of the compound. 
LESSING: Aye, sir. Warp drive ready. 
RANSOM: Engage. 
(Shudder then a jolt.)
RANSOM: What happened? 
[Equinox Engineering] 
GILMORE: The power relays are offline. They've been encoded. 
[Equinox Sickbay] 
RANSOM: Give us the codes. 
SEVEN: No. 
BURKE: If she won't give us the codes maybe we could extract them ourselves. 
EMH: Seven's cranial infrastructure is highly complex. You'll need months just to figure out what she had for breakfast. 
BURKE: That's why you're going to help us. 
EMH: I refuse. 
BURKE: Do it or I'll erase your programme. 
EMH: Be my guest. 
SEVEN: Doctor. 
EMH: Don't worry, they need me. They'd be cutting off their holographic nose to spite their face. Now I suggest you 
(Ransom does something at a console, and the EMH flickers.)
RANSOM: All right, Doctor. Now, get to work. You know what we're looking for. 
EMH: Very well. She'll try to resist. I'll have to restrain her. 
SEVEN: Doctor. 
RANSOM: I deleted his ethical subroutines. He'll be a little more cooperative now. Keep me posted. 
EMH: Aye, Captain. This way, please. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY: It's not exactly Shakespeare, but it gets the point across. 
CHAKOTAY: A small olive branch is still an olive branch. 
JANEWAY: Run this through to your translation matrix. 
CHAKOTAY: Set your weapons down. 
PARIS: Commander? 
CHAKOTAY: Somebody's got to start trusting somebody around here. 
JANEWAY: Belay that order. I appreciate your optimism, but in this case, weapons. 
KIM: Ready to transmit. 
JANEWAY: Drop shields, bridge only. Go ahead, Harry. 
(A fissure forms and an alien flies towards Kim. It screeches at him a bit, then leaves.)
JANEWAY: Raise shields. 
KIM: If they understood our message, they haven't responded. 
JANEWAY: There's your response. Activate another deflector pulse. 
TUVOK: Shields are holding at sixty two percent. 
JANEWAY: That should buy us another few minutes of peace and quiet. I suggest we make the most of it. Focus your efforts on repairing the warp drive. We've got to find the Equinox. 
CHAKOTAY: If it's all the same to you, I'd like to take another stab at the message. If we can reroute 
JANEWAY: They're not listening, Chakotay. We should be tracking Ransom, not tinkering with adverbs. 
[Ready room] 
CHAKOTAY: Want your First Officer's advice? 
JANEWAY: Allow me. Our deflector's losing power, and when it fails, we'll be defenceless. It's Voyager we should be worrying about, not the Equinox. 
CHAKOTAY: You'd make a great First Officer. It's advice worth taking. 
JANEWAY: Maybe so, but we have a crew member trapped on that ship. 
CHAKOTAY: Is this really about Seven, or is it about Ransom? 
JANEWAY: I don't know what you're talking about. 
CHAKOTAY: You've been known to hold a grudge. This man betrayed Starfleet, he broke the Prime Directive, dishonoured everything you believe in, and threw Voyager to the wolves. 
JANEWAY: Borg, Hirogen, Malon. We've run into our share of bad guys. Ransom's no different. 
CHAKOTAY: Yes, he is. You said it yourself. He's human. I don't blame you for being angry, but you can't compromise the safety of this ship to satisfy some personal vendetta. 
JANEWAY: I appreciate your candour. Now let me be just as blunt. You're right, I am angry. I'm damned angry. He's a Starfleet Captain, and he's decided to abandon everything this uniform stands for. He's out there right now, torturing and murdering innocent lifeforms just to get home a little quicker. I'm not going to stand for it. I'm going to hunt him down no matter how long it takes, no matter what the cost. If you want to call that a vendetta, go right ahead. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
(Equinox orbits a planet.)
BURKE: Why did you bring us here? 
RANSOM: This planet has a parthogenic atmosphere. It will keep us from being detected while we make repairs. 
LESSING: We also found a few deuterium deposits. 
RANSOM: Take an away team, Noah, and see if you can localise the ore. 
BURKE: You won't be protected from the aliens. Arm yourselves with phasers. At the first sign of trouble, we'll beam you back. 
LESSING: Aye, sir. 
[Equinox Sickbay] 
(To the tune of Dem Bones, the evil EMH has opened up half of Seven's face to get at the whole of her cortical implant.)
EMH: The ocular node's connected to the sensory node. The sensory node's connected to the cortical node. The cortical node's connected to the reticular node. Don't look so gloomy. There's a silver lining to all this. Just think, we're finally going to see Earth. 
SEVEN: You are obviously delusional. Allow me to repair your programme. 
EMH: Now why would I want you to do that? You of all people should understand. Being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient. 
(Ransom enters.)
RANSOM: Status? 
EMH: I'm going to extract her cortical array. It contains an index of her memory engrams. But once I've removed it her higher brain functions, language, cognitive skills will be severely damaged. 
RANSOM: Tell me the codes. 
SEVEN: No. 
JANEWAY: Janeway was right about one thing. You are unique. It would be a shame to lose you. 
SEVEN: Your compassion is irrelevant. 
RANSOM: You think this is easy for me? The sight of you on that table. But you're leaving me no choice. 
SEVEN: No choice. You say that frequently. You destroy lifeforms to attain your goals, then claim that they left you no choice. Does that logic comfort you? 
RANSOM: The codes. 
SEVEN: You'll have to destroy me to obtain them. 
(Ransom nods and leaves. The EMH resumes his song.)
EMH: The reticular node's connected to the occipital node. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Our warp drive's back online, but repeated sensor sweeps have failed to locate the Equinox. 
[Ready room] 
JANEWAY: Come in. 
CHAKOTAY: You wanted to see me? 
JANEWAY: It's not like you to submit recommendations in writing. 
CHAKOTAY: The last time we spoke you weren't exactly receptive. 
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I'm not going to be very receptive this time, either. It's an interesting idea, but the Ankari are fifty light years in the wrong direction. 
CHAKOTAY: I understand that, but they're the ones who introduced Ransom to these lifeforms. It stands to reason they might be able to communicate with them, tell them to call off their attacks. 
JANEWAY: Our first priority is to find Ransom. Still no sign of nucleogenic particles? 
CHAKOTAY: Not yet. 
JANEWAY: Then he couldn't have gotten far. Without his enhanced drive, his ship's only capable of warp six. I've been studying his service record. He's had his share of run-ins with hostile aliens. It seems that when he's being pursued, he tends to hide. At Epsilon four he ran into a Klingon Bird-of-Prey. Played a game of cat and mouse for three days in a nebula before the Klingons finally gave up. Two years later, he eluded a Romulan Warbird by taking his vessel into the atmosphere of a gas giant. Go to Astrometrics. Start looking for the kind of place you'd hide if your ship was damaged. 
CHAKOTAY: Yes, ma'am. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
(Ransom retreats into his favourite fantasy again. Seven is there, in a pink dress. He removes the synaptic stimulator.)
GILMORE: How was the beach? 
RANSOM: Do these programmes have people in them? 
GILMORE: No, just landscapes. Why? 
RANSOM: Forget it. 
[Planet surface] 
LESSING: I'm reading a vein of ore. Azimuth one seventeen, thirty metres. It could run pretty deep. We might need to use phasers to excavate it. It's funny, this reminds me of McKinley Park. I used to take my sister there when we were kids. This place looks just like it. As I recall, there was a family of ground squirrels who lived right over there. There was a patch of poison ivy next to it. When I was ten, I walked right through it and I swelled up like a Rigellian bloodworm. When I get back to Earth the first thing I'm going to do is 
(His companion gets knocked out by a rifle butt, and he gets stunned.)
CHAKOTAY: Four to beam up. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
GILMORE: We're receiving a subspace transmission. 
RANSOM: From who? 
GILMORE: I can't tell. 
RANSOM: I don't see a ship out there. Open a channel. 
E-EMH [OC]: Doctor to Equinox. Respond. 
RANSOM: We can hear you. 
E-EMH [OC]: Voyager's found you. They've entered orbit. They polarised their hull to mask their approach. 
[Sickbay]
E-EMH: I believe they've planned an ambush on the away team. 
[Equinox Bridge]
E-EMH [OC]: Janeway's been tracking the Equinox for a couple 
RANSOM: Get him back. 
GILMORE: I can't. 
RANSOM: Ransom to away team. Noah, prepare to beam back to the ship. 
GILMORE: They're not down there. 
RANSOM: All hands to battle stations. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: Thirty thousand kilometres and closing. 
JANEWAY: Target their power core. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
GILMORE: Direct hit. Minor damage. 
RANSOM: Return fire. 
[Bridge] 
(Whumph!)
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Torres. Status. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
TORRES: I can't locate their shield grid generator. Can you divert more power to sensors? 
[Bridge] 
CHAKOTAY: Stand by. 
TUVOK: They've damaged our deflector, Captain. If it goes offline, we'll be vulnerable to the alien attacks. 
JANEWAY: Noted. Target his weapons array. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
GILMORE: We lost all phaser banks. 
RANSOM: Torpedoes, full spread. 
BURKE: It's B'Elanna. She's trying to bypass our security protocols. 
RANSOM: Stop her. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
TORRES: Computer, open a comm. link to the Equinox. Workstation thirty three beta. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
TORRES [on monitor]: Max, listen to me. 
BURKE: Back for round two, BLT? 
TORRES [on monitor]: This isn't one of our games. People are dying over here. 
BURKE: I wish you didn't have to be one of them. 
TORRES: Max, please. 
[Bridge] 
TUVOK: Shields are weakening, 
JANEWAY: We've almost got him. Keep targeting their weapons array. One more torpedo ought to do it. 
TUVOK: Captain. 
JANEWAY: Fire! 
[Equinox Bridge] 
GILMORE: Weapons are down! 
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Ransom. Surrender your vessel. 
RANSOM: We still have thrusters, don't we? 
GILMORE: Aye, sir. 
RANSOM: Lay in a course through the planet's atmosphere. Sixty degree vector. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY: What the hell is he doing? Follow him. 
PARIS: We're crossing the upper thermosphere. 
JANEWAY: Phasers. 
TUVOK: Shields are weakening. Thirty one percent, twenty nine. 
KIM: Inertial dampers are offline. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if we loose our shields, we'll be attacked by the aliens. Captain! 
JANEWAY: Break off pursuit. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
GILMORE: They're retreating. 
RANSOM: Take us up! 
BURKE: They took heavy damage. Shields, propulsion. 
RANSOM: Get us out of here. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: They've gone to warp. 
JANEWAY: Match their course and speed. 
KIM: We can't, not until we restore primary systems. 
JANEWAY: Time? 
KIM: We'll need a few hours. 
JANEWAY: At least we didn't come away empty-handed. 
[Cargo Bay two] 
JANEWAY: I want Ransom's tactical status. I want it now, Mister Lessing. 
LESSING: Or what, you'll hit me? 
JANEWAY: No, crewman. I'll drop the shields around this room and let your little friends come pay you a visit. 
LESSING: That would be murder. 
JANEWAY: You could also call it poetic justice. 
LESSING: I suppose the plan is that you're going to come to my rescue now, right? 
CHAKOTAY: There's no plan as far as I know. The captain's on her own. 
JANEWAY: Ransom's status, now. 
LESSING: No way in hell. 
JANEWAY: We all make our own hell, Mister Lessing. I hope you enjoy yours. The comm. is active. We'll be outside if you have a change of heart. 
[Corridor] 
CHAKOTAY: What are you doing? 
JANEWAY: Weren't you listening? 
CHAKOTAY: Don't do this. 
JANEWAY: He'll break. 
[Bridge] 
TUVOK: Bridge to the Captain. We've lost shields in section twenty nine alpha. 
JANEWAY [OC]: I know. Stand by. 
[Corridor] 
CHAKOTAY: He's a loyal officer. He's not going to betray his captain. Put up the shields. 
JANEWAY: He'll break. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain! 
JANEWAY: As you were. 
(Chakotay tries to put up the shields.)
COMPUTER: Level nine authorisation required. 
CHAKOTAY: Damn it, Kathryn! 
JANEWAY: You're panicking. He's going to talk. 
[Bridge] 
TUVOK: Captain, a fissure is opening in that section. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Understood. 
(Chakotay goes into Cargo Bay two, drives back the alien and brings Lessing out.) 
[Corridor] 
CHAKOTAY: Okay, you've demonstrated your loyalty to your captain. Fine. Now let's talk about the Ankari.
(Janeway walks away, grim-faced.) 
[Briefing room] 
TORRES: If there's an Ankari vessel less than two light years from here, why haven't we detected it? 
CHAKOTAY: Apparently, they use a unique form of propulsion, which makes them hard to find. 
PARIS: You think they'll be willing to help us? 
CHAKOTAY: It's worth a try. Mister Lessing has agreed to show you how to adjust the sensors. Once you find the Ankari ship, set a course. 
PARIS: Aye, sir. 
E-EMH: Did our prisoner disclose any other information? 
CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid not. The rest of you continue with the repairs. Dismissed. 
JANEWAY: Commander. 
(Chakotay stays behind.)
JANEWAY: All right, we're going to try it your way. But I want to make one thing clear. 
CHAKOTAY: Our first priority is to get Ransom. If there's one thing you've made clear, it's that. 
JANEWAY: We've had our disagreements, Chakotay, but you've never openly opposed me. 
CHAKOTAY: You almost killed that man today. 
JANEWAY: It was a calculated risk and I took it. 
CHAKOTAY: It was a bad call. 
JANEWAY: I'll note your objection in my log. 
CHAKOTAY: I don't give a damn about your log. This isn't about rules and regulations. It's about right and wrong. And I'm warning you, I won't let you cross that line again. 
JANEWAY: Then you leave me no choice. You are hereby relieved of duty until further notice. 
CHAKOTAY: What's happened to you, Kathryn? 
JANEWAY: I was about to ask you the same question. 
[Bridge] 
(Voyager is chasing an Ankari vessel.)
TUVOK: They are not responding. 
JANEWAY: Tractor beam. 
TUVOK: Captain, the Ankari ship has done nothing 
JANEWAY: Just do it. 
KIM: We're being hailed. 
JANEWAY: On screen. 
ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Starfleet. 
JANEWAY: Yes. 
ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Leave us alone. There's nothing of value on our ship. 
JANEWAY: We need your guidance. Your spirits of good fortune are attacking us. 
ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Of course they are. You've been killing them. 
JANEWAY: We are not the ones responsible. 
ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Equinox. 
JANEWAY: That's right. Can you communicate with the aliens? 
ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Release my ship. 
JANEWAY: I can't do that. Not until you agree to talk to them. 
ANKARI [on viewscreen]: I will summon them, but you must talk to them. You must convince them. 
[Cargo Bay two] 
(The summoning device brings three aliens into the bay.)
ANKARI: They say they want the humans to die. 
TUVOK: A difficult place to start a negotiation. 
JANEWAY: Will they understand me? 
ANKARI: Yes. 
JANEWAY: We didn't do this to you. We're trying to stop the humans who did. 
ANKARI: They don't believe you would harm your own kind. 
JANEWAY: We have rules for behaviour. The Equinox has broken those rules by killing your species. It's our duty to stop them. 
ANKARI: Give us the Equinox. Give us the Equinox. They insist on destroying the ones who are responsible. 
TUVOK: We will punish them according to our own rules. They will be imprisoned. They will lose their freedom. 
JANEWAY: All right! If you stop your attacks, I'll deliver the Equinox to you. 
TUVOK: Captain. 
JANEWAY: I know what I'm doing, Tuvok. 
TUVOK: These beings would destroy Captain Ransom and his crew. 
JANEWAY: What's their answer? 
TUVOK: Your behaviour is irrational. We could find another solution. 
JANEWAY: I've already confined my First Officer to quarters. Would you like to join him? Well? 
ANKARI: They agree, 
[Equinox Bridge] 
BURKE: We're going to need more fuel. We've only got enough left to jump another five hundred light years. 
RANSOM: Fuel. Is that the euphemism we're using now? You mean we need to kill more lifeforms. 
BURKE: Several more. 
[Equinox Sickbay] 
(Another sing-song is in progress.)
EMH: Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling 
SEVEN: Clementine. 
RANSOM: How much longer? 
EMH: Another hour, maybe less. You are lost and gone forever 
SEVEN: Dreadful sorry, Clementine. 
RANSOM: What are you doing? 
EMH: Her auditory processor. We used to practice duets together. In fact, I taught her this old chestnut. Light she was and like a fairy. 
SEVEN: And her shoes were number nine. 
EMH: Herring boxes without topses. 
SEVEN: Sandals were for Clementine. 
EMH: Drove she ducklings to the water 
RANSOM: Enough. 
EMH: Why the long face, Captain? You're about to get your crew home. She tried to stand in your way. You had no choice. 
RANSOM: No choice. Thank you, Doctor. 
EMH: When this is all over, perhaps you'll allow me to teach you my repertoire. I'm going to need a new partner. 
(Ransom leaves.)
EMH: Hmm. Drove she ducklings to the water. 
[Equinox - Ransom's quarters] 
(Ransom puts on his synaptic stimulator. Seven is standing on a rocky outcrop, only she is completely human.)
RANSOM: You. What are you doing here? 
SEVEN [in his mind]: Hiding, like you. 
RANSOM: I'm not hiding. 
SEVEN [in his mind]: It's beautiful. I can see why this brings you comfort. 
RANSOM: I don't know what you're talking about. 
SEVEN [in his mind]: But it isn't real. 
RANSOM: You're not real. Now leave me alone. 
SEVEN [in his mind]: It's not too late to stop. 
RANSOM: I don't have a choice. 
SEVEN [in his mind]: Find another way. 
RANSOM: There is no other way. 
SEVEN [in his mind]: Stop trying to hide. 
RANSOM: I told you, I'm not hiding. Now get away from me. 
SEVEN [in his mind]: End this. 
RANSOM: No! 
(The image of Seven morphs into an alien. He rips off the stimulator.)
BURKE [OC]: Bridge to Ransom. 
RANSOM: Go ahead. 
BURKE [OC]: Janeway's found us. 
RANSOM: On my way. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
BURKE: Distance? 
GILMORE: Fifty thousand kilometres, closing fast. 
BURKE: Maintain course. Voyager's approaching at high warp. There's a class two nebula less than a light year from here. Janeway's sensors won't be able to track us once we're inside. I think that we should pursue this course. 
RANSOM: No. Open a channel. 
BURKE: Change of tactics? 
RANSOM: You might say that. It's time we found another way home. 
BURKE: Another way? 
RANSOM: We're going to cooperate with Janeway, Max, if she's willing. 
BURKE: Rudy, with all due respect, have you lost your mind? 
RANSOM: Just the opposite. 
GILMORE: They're within range. They're charging weapons. 
RANSOM: Hail them. 
BURKE: Belay that order. Raise shields. 
RANSOM: You're relieved of duty, Commander. 
BURKE: I'm taking command. Anyone who isn't with me, speak up now. Take him to the brig. 
(Burke takes Ransom's phaser.)
GILMORE: I'm sorry. 
(Gilmore escorts Ransom off the bridge.)
BURKE: What's the status of our weapons? 
THOMPSON: Full complement of torpedoes. Minimal phasers. 
BURKE: Open a secure channel to their Sickbay. Stand by weapons. 
THOMPSON: Aye, sir. 
[Medical lab] 
(Subspace comm protocols 047. The Equinox EMH answers the beeps.)
E-EMH: I'm here. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
BURKE: We're going to need your help, Doctor. See if you can find Voyager's current shield frequency. 
[Medical lab] 
E-EMH: Acknowledged. I'll need a few minutes. 
[Bridge] 
TUVOK: They are firing torpedoes. 
KIM: Direct hit to our port shields. They're holding. 
JANEWAY: Return the favour. 
[Equinox Engineering] 
RANSOM: This isn't the brig. 
GILMORE: I know. I'm with you, sir. Let's find a way to end this. 
RANSOM: We'll need to access transporter control. 
[Bridge] 
(Voyager continues to throw photon torpedoes at Equinox.)
KIM: We've damaged their port nacelle. They're venting plasma.
PARIS: They're dropping out of warp. 
JANEWAY: Stay with them. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
E-EMH [OC]: Doctor to Equinox. I've got their shield frequency. 
[Medical lab] 
E-EMH: I'm transmitting it to you now. 
BURKE [OC]: They'll try to remodulate. Keep monitoring. 
E-EMH: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge] 
TORRES: They've slowed to one quarter impulse. 
JANEWAY: Prepare a tractor beam. 
TUVOK: They are launching another torpedo. 
JANEWAY: Full power to the forward shields. 
(Big Whumph!)
KIM: Hull breach on deck four. 
TORRES: How'd they get through our shields? 
JANEWAY: Hard about. Get us out of range. Remodulate the shields. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
THOMPSON: They're retreating. 
BURKE: Pursuit course. Maintain fire. 
[Bridge] 
KIM: They took out the weapons array. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok. 
TUVOK: I've been rotating the shield frequency every ten seconds. 
PARIS: We've lost impulse engines. 
KIM: We're being hailed. It's Ransom. 
JANEWAY: Put him through. 
RANSOM [on viewscreen]: Captain, I'm prepared to surrender the Equinox, but I'm no longer in command. Max decided to stage a little mutiny, but I think I can stop him. I've isolated transporter control. I can beam all of us to Voyager. You might want to have some guards standing by. Not everyone here is going to be happy to see you. 
JANEWAY: Proceed. 
PARIS: Ma'am? 
JANEWAY: He's still a Starfleet captain. He may have forgotten that for a while, but I believe him. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
BURKE: Someone's trying to beam us off. Forcefields. 
[Equinox Engineering] 
GILMORE: They're deflecting our targeting scanners. 
RANSOM: Then beam the others to Voyager, yourself included. I'll take care of Max. 
GILMORE: Aye, sir. 
RANSOM: Computer, Give me access to the shield grid. 
[Sickbay] 
(Seven is amongst those beamed into a transporter room.)
EMH: Well, I see you've made yourself at home. 
E-EMH: What are you doing here? 
EMH: Taking back my Sickbay. 
E-EMH: Stop where you are. I've planted photonic charges throughout these holo-projectors. With one command sequence, I can blow out your entire 
EMH: Computer, delete the Equinox EMH.
[Equinox Bridge] 
THOMPSON: The Doctor's not transmitting anymore. 
BURKE: Burke to Doctor, report. 
EMH [OC]: I'm afraid your physician's no longer on call. 
RANSOM [OC]: Max, this is the Captain. I've dropped the shield grid 
[Equinox Engineering] 
RANSOM: Everywhere except the bridge and my current location. 
[Equinox Bridge] 
RANSOM [OC]: The vital systems are exposed. 
[Equinox Engineering] 
RANSOM: I suggest you beam to Voyager while you still can. 
(Aliens enter Engineering.) 
[Equinox Bridge] 
THOMPSON: The core is overloading. We've got to get out of here. 
BURKE: Where? Voyager's brig? 
THOMPSON: It's better than being vaporised. 
BURKE: We still have a working shuttle. 
THOMPSON: The shuttle bay's two decks down. Sir, the aliens! 
BURKE: We'll make it. 
[Equinox Corridor] 
(Burke shoots at two forming fissures.)
BURKE: This way.
(More fissures form both in front and behind the four people. They are overwhelmed and killed.) 
[Bridge] 
KIM: There's only one life sign left. It's Ransom. 
JANEWAY: Captain. 
RANSOM [on viewscreen]: Things didn't work out exactly as I planned, but you've got everyone worth getting. 
JANEWAY: We're beaming you out of there. 
RANSOM [on viewscreen]: This ship is about to explode. I've got to put some distance between us. I've accessed helm control. 
JANEWAY: You can set auto-navigation and then transport to Voyager. 
RANSOM [on viewscreen]: There's no time! You've got a fine crew, Captain. Promise me you'll get them home. 
JANEWAY: I promise. 
(Transmission ends. They watch the one-engined Equinox fly away, venting plasma. Ransom retreats into his favourite fantasy, then Equinox goes KaBOOM!) 
Captain's log, supplemental. With the Equinox destroyed, the aliens have withdrawn to their realm. I've reinstated Chakotay and we've set a course for home. 
[Sickbay] 
EMH: Good as new. I'd like you to regenerate for the next few hours. It'll help stabilise your cortical array. 
SEVEN: Understood. 
EMH: Regarding the unpleasantness aboard the Equinox. I hope you don't think less of me. 
SEVEN: Your programme was altered. 
EMH: It's quite disconcerting to know that all someone has to do is flick a switch to turn me into Mister Hyde. 
SEVEN: Perhaps you should enhance your programme with security protocols. It will prevent such tampering in the future. 
EMH: Good thinking. 
SEVEN: When I'm done regenerating, I will assist you. 
EMH: Thanks. 
SEVEN: You were off-key. 
EMH: I beg your pardon? 
SEVEN: My Darling Clementine, third verse, second measure. 
EMH: That's impossible. 
SEVEN: Your vocal modulations deviated by point three zero decihertz. I can assist you with that as well. 
EMH: Really? Holodeck two, tomorrow, sixteen hundred hours. Just you, me, and a tuning fork. 
SEVEN: I look forward to it. 
[Briefing room] 
JANEWAY: The last time we welcomed you aboard, you took advantage of our trust. You betrayed this crew. I won't make that mistake again. Noah Lessing, Marla Gilmore, James Morrow, Brian Sofin, Angelo Tassoni, you are hereby stripped of rank. You'll be expected to serve as crewmen on this vessel. Your privileges will be limited, and you'll serve under close supervision for as long as I deem fit. This time, you'll have to earn our trust. Dismissed. 
(The former Equinox crew leave with Tuvok.)
JANEWAY: Repairs? 
CHAKOTAY: Coming along. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY: How's the crew? 
CHAKOTAY: A lot of frayed nerves. Neelix is organising a potluck to help boost morale. 
JANEWAY: Will I see you there? 
CHAKOTAY: I'm replicating the salad. 
JANEWAY: I'll bring the croutons. Chakotay. You know, you may have had good reason to stage a little mutiny of your own. 
CHAKOTAY: The thought had occurred to me, but that would have been crossing the line. 
JANEWAY: Will you look at that? 
(Voyager's dedication plaque is on the deck.)
JANEWAY: All these years, all these battles. This thing's never fallen down before. 
CHAKOTAY: Let's put it back up where it belongs.
