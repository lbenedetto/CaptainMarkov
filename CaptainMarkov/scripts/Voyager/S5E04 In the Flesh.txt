In The Flesh
[Starfleet Headquarters - garden] 
(An eldery man tends a protea plant, and picks its everlasting bloom.)
BULLOCK: Welcome to Earth. I am Admiral Bullock, and I will be your Commanding Officer for the next six months. Questions, comments, bring them to me. Problems, talk to Lieutenant Kinis.(a Vulcan.) Larsen, you're assigned to the Federation Council, Deputy Liaison Officer. Young and Raskin, report to Orbital Flight Control. You'll be monitoring incoming vessels from the Bolian sector. 
(Someone is watching and taking photographs of the people. It is Chakotay, with the EMH's holo-camera. A short time later, he is scanning a stand of bamboo. The gardener walks up to him)
BOOTHBY: I can save you some time there, son. They're bamboo. 
CHAKOTAY: I know that. Unfortunately, my tricorder's reading them as maple trees. I think the isodyne relays must be malfunctioning. 
BOOTHBY: Why don't you pay a visit to Logistical Support? Maybe they'll issue you a new one. 
CHAKOTAY: Good idea. 
BOOTHBY: I'm going that way myself. Mind some company? 
CHAKOTAY: Not at all. 
BOOTHBY: So, what's your assignment here? 
CHAKOTAY: I don't know. I haven't received my orders yet. I just arrived. 
BOOTHBY: From where? 
CHAKOTAY: A three year tour on the Intrepid. 
BOOTHBY: Is that a fact? I thought the Intrepid was patrolling the Neutral Zone. 
CHAKOTAY: It is. I caught a transport vessel at Deep Space Seven. 
BOOTHBY: Ah. Got tired of wrestling with the Romulans. 
CHAKOTAY: Let's just say it's good to be back. What about yourself? How long have you been posted here, Mister? 
BOOTHBY: Boothby. Boothby's the name. 
CHAKOTAY: Boothby. I've heard of you. 
BOOTHBY: I should hope so. I've been tending these grounds for fifty four years, give or take a few months. 
CHAKOTAY: And beautiful grounds they are. 
BOOTHBY: Mmm hmm. Logistical Support. Straight through the main complex, second door on your right. 
CHAKOTAY: Thank you. 
BOOTHBY: Commander, Logistics is a secure area. They won't let you in with that holo-imaging device. Fresh from the Neutral Zone? You're not a Romulan double agent, are you, son? 
CHAKOTAY: Actually, I was just recording a few images for my friends back home. Would you mind posing for a shot? 
BOOTHBY: Me? You want a picture of me? 
CHAKOTAY: The one and only Boothby. My friends would be impressed. 
BOOTHBY: Well, when you put it that way. Cadet, take our picture, will you? 
(Chakotay hands the camera over to a young red-headed woman.)
BOOTHBY: Don't cut off our heads. I expect a copy of that, young man. 
[Quantum Cafe] 
(Chakotay sits on a bar stool and opens a book left on the counter. A woman walks up.)
ARCHER: You're in my seat. And you're reading my book. Do you want my drink, too? 
CHAKOTAY: Depends. What is it? 
ARCHER: Klingon martini. Vermouth, gin, with a dash of bloodwine. 
CHAKOTAY: Bloodwine? Never touch the stuff. 
ARCHER: What do you like? 
CHAKOTAY: Excuse me. I was waiting for a friend. 
ARCHER: Valerie Archer. 
CHAKOTAY: Hayek. Jason Hayek. 
ARCHER: Nice tattoo. I bet there's a story behind it. 
CHAKOTAY: A long one. A Cave Beyond Logic: Vulcan Perspectives on Platonic Thought. Sounds fascinating. 
ARCHER: You can borrow it if you like. 
CHAKOTAY: Thanks anyway. I can only take small doses of Vulcan philosophy. 
ARCHER: Stationed here? 
CHAKOTAY: Temporarily. 
ARCHER: Where do you call home? 
CHAKOTAY: You first. Where are you from? 
ARCHER: Everywhere. My parents were starship officers. By the time I was ten I'd seen half the quadrant. 
CHAKOTAY: Starfleet brat. 
ARCHER: Bratty as they come. 
(There is a crash as a chair is knocked over. A man is clutching at his throat while his face wibbles. His friends drag him away.)
ARCHER: Can I ask you a question. Have you ever reverted? 
CHAKOTAY: Reverted? Not yet. 
ARCHER: Ensign O'Halloran, this is his third time this week. If it happens again, they'll pull him out of training. 
CHAKOTAY: What about you. Any trouble? 
ARCHER: Oh, I can keep my human form. It's the little things that bother me. 
CHAKOTAY: Little things? 
ARCHER: Breathing oxygen, bipedal locomotion, and sleeping. The concept of being unconscious for eight hours a night, it's so alien. 
CHAKOTAY: I know what you mean. 
ARCHER: That's why I started reading their books. For some reason it helps me relax. But we shouldn't be talking about this. Think human, talk human, be human. Remember? 
CHAKOTAY: How could I forget? 
ARCHER: So, had a chance to take a look around? 
CHAKOTAY: Not yet. 
ARCHER: Headquarters has a lot more to offer than conference rooms and consoles, if you have the right guide. 
CHAKOTAY: Is that an invitation? 
ARCHER: I get off duty at nineteen hundred hours. 
TUVOK: Commander. 
ARCHER: Speak of the devil. 
CHAKOTAY: We were just discussing Vulcan philosophy. 
ARCHER: Join us. 
TUVOK: Another time, perhaps. We have work to do. 
ARCHER: Oh, can't it wait? 
CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid not. 
ARCHER: What about tonight? Do we have a date? Nineteen hundred hours. Meet you right here. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll do my best. 
ARCHER: Live long and prosper. 
(Chakotay and Tuvok walk away.)
TUVOK: A date? 
CHAKOTAY: Relax, Tuvok. I plan on standing her up. 
TUVOK: We agreed to limit our investigation to surveillance. 
CHAKOTAY: It was worth the risk. She talked about training. These are some kind of aliens learning to pose as humans. 
TUVOK: For what purpose? 
CHAKOTAY: I don't know. I didn't get that far. 
TUVOK: We're due back at the transporter coordinates. 
[Starfleet Headquarters - gardens] 
GENTRY: Excuse me, gentlemen. You've entered a restricted area. Captains and above. 
CHAKOTAY: Sorry. We didn't realise.
GENTRY: I'm going to have to ask you to come with me. 
TUVOK: Why? 
GENTRY: All unauthorised personnel are to be debriefed by Starfleet Intelligence. Direct orders from Admiral Bullock. 
CHAKOTAY: Listen, Ensign, we're late for a meeting with Starfleet Command. The debriefing will have to wait. 
GENTRY: I'm sorry, Commander. 
(Gentry has pulled out his phaser.)
CHAKOTAY: Very well. 
(Gentry turns with Chakotay, and Tuvok neck-pinches him from behind.)
TUVOK: When he regains consciousness, he'll no doubt want to report this incident. 
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Paris, three to beam up. 
PARIS [OC]: Three? 
CHAKOTAY: I'll explain later. 
[Delta Flyer] 
PARIS: Who's that? 
CHAKOTAY: One of Starfleet's finest. Take us to Voyager. 
KIM: What did you find down there? 
TUVOK: Earth. 
[Sickbay] 
(Gentry wakes on the biobed in the surgical alcove.)
JANEWAY: Welcome aboard. 
GENTRY: Where am I? 
JANEWAY: On a starship. 
GENTRY: What starship? Why have you brought me here? I'll be reporting this incident to the Admiral. 
CHAKOTAY: You can drop the charade. We know you're not human. 
JANEWAY: Who are you? 
GENTRY: Gentry, David. Rank, Ensign. Starfleet service number nine nine beta three two seven eight. Planet of origin, Earth. 
JANEWAY: We're not interested in your knowledge of human culture. We're not part of your re-creation. I'm Captain Janeway of the Federation Starship Voyager. I'm from Earth. You're not. 
GENTRY: Gentry, David. Rank, Ensign. Starfleet service number nine nine beta three two seven eight. 
JANEWAY: Doctor. 
GENTRY: What are you doing? 
EMH: I need a sample of your DNA. 
GENTRY: Why? 
JANEWAY: Since you won't tell us who you are, we have no choice but to find out for ourselves. 
EMH: You won't be harmed. 
GENTRY: Gentry to Headquarters. Security alert! 
CHAKOTAY: We've disabled your comm. badge. 
(Gentry knocks the EMH's hand aside and leaps off the biobed.)
GENTRY: No! Don't touch me. Disease! Humans! 
(Gentry collapses.)
EMH: It appears he's released a cellular toxin into his bloodstream. He's dead. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Until we know exactly what's going on I'm keeping Voyager concealed behind a class three moon. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
(Chakotay is showing his photographs on a wall monitor.)
CHAKOTAY: Federation Council, Astrophysics, Starfleet Medical complex. They even re-created the Officers' Club, the Quantum Cafï¿½. 
JANEWAY: Computer, return to time index 4228. That's Boothby. 
SEVEN: Captain? 
JANEWAY: The head groundskeeper at Starfleet Academy. When I was a cadet, he used to give me fresh roses for my quarters. 
TUVOK: It's safe to assume this individual is not Boothby. 
JANEWAY: Whoever they are, they've gathered incredibly accurate information about Starfleet headquarters. 
SEVEN: Perhaps they had access to a Federation database. 
CHAKOTAY: Or they've been to San Francisco. 
TUVOK: The habitat's population consists of humans, Vulcans, Bolian, Ferengi. All Alpha Quadrant species. 
JANEWAY: What do we know about this artificial environment, Seven? 
SEVEN: I've used the tricorder data, holo-images and astrometric scans to extrapolate a cross-section of the interior. I believe they used a combination of holographic projection and particle synthesis. 
JANEWAY: Power source? 
SEVEN: There are thirteen thermionic generators beneath the city. I can't identify the energy signatures. 
TUVOK: The habitat's heavily fortified. They are well prepared to defend against an attack. 
EMH [OC]: Sickbay to Captain. 
JANEWAY: Go ahead. 
EMH [OC]: I've completed my post-mortem analysis. You'd better get down here. 
JANEWAY: On my way. If this is a training ground, it could mean they're planning an invasion of the Federation. We should prepare for the worst. See if you can find a way to penetrate their defences. 
[Sickbay] 
EMH: He may look human, he may sound human, he may even smell human, but there's no question, he's alien. 
JANEWAY: Was he genetically altered? 
EMH: On a highly sophisticated level. If it weren't for microcellular scans I wouldn't be able to distinguish him from the genuine article. I've managed to isolate the alien DNA. Fortunately, most of his cells are still chemically active. If I use a cytokinetic injection I should be able to trigger a genetic reversion. 
JANEWAY: Do it. 
(The reversion results in the massive form of Species 8472 flopping over the tiny biobed.)
EMH: Talk about a wolf in sheep's clothing. 
[Briefing room] 
JANEWAY: Species 8472. The question is, why are they training to pose as human beings? 
PARIS: Back in the twentieth century, the Soviets used to build American towns to train their agents to infiltrate the United States. Species 8472 could be doing the same thing. 
KIM: They're going to infiltrate the Alpha Quadrant. 
PARIS: Maybe they already have. 
TORRES: Tom's right. How else could they have gathered their information about us? 
SEVEN: Perhaps they've acquired it from the Borg. 
JANEWAY: It doesn't matter how they got their data. We need to find out what they intend to do with it. 
SEVEN: If our previous experience is any indication, they will try to destroy Earth. 
TUVOK: A logical assumption. They did threaten to purge our galaxy of all life. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok, keep working on a way to target their habitat's power source. We're going to need nanoprobe warheads and plenty of them. Seven, see to it. 
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. 
CHAKOTAY: In the meantime, I've got a date to keep. I made contact with one of them, Commander Valerie Archer. Maybe I can capitalise on the relationship. Get a better idea of what they're planning. 
JANEWAY: Tom, Harry, take him back in the Delta Flyer. Keep a constant transporter lock on him. If Species 8472 attacks Earth, the Federation won't have any defences against them, and I don't need to remind you that we have no way to warn Starfleet Command. Voyager may be the last defense against an all-out invasion of Earth. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
(Chakotay is going through the reconstruction of the habitat.)
JANEWAY: Last minute preparations? 
CHAKOTAY: Just planning my big night out. 
JANEWAY: I can recommend a nice Japanese replimat on the Embarcadero. 
CHAKOTAY: I was never very good with chopsticks. 
JANEWAY: Starfleet headquarters. Brings back memories, even if it is just a re-creation. I remember my last visit there. I was given my general orders for Voyager's first mission. Proceed to the Badlands and find the Maquis. 
CHAKOTAY: The orders that brought us together. 
JANEWAY: What about you? When was the last time you were at Headquarters? 
CHAKOTAY: Before today? March 3rd, 2368. The day I resigned my commission. I can still remember the look on the Admiral's face. 
JANEWAY: Which one? 
CHAKOTAY: Nimembeh. 
JANEWAY: He taught at the Academy, didn't he? 
CHAKOTAY: That's right. 
JANEWAY: Interspecies Ethics, wasn't it? 
CHAKOTAY: Tactical Analysis. 
JANEWAY: Of course. 
CHAKOTAY: Kathryn, you think I might be one of them. You're testing me. 
JANEWAY: You and Tuvok were in the alien habitat for nearly three hours. Anything could have happened down there. 
CHAKOTAY: True. Why don't you have Tuvok meet us in Sickbay. The Doctor can perform a microcellular analysis. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok's already there. 
CHAKOTAY: You could have just asked me to report to Sickbay. 
JANEWAY: Given Ensign Gentry's reaction, I thought I'd be a little more tactful. 
[Corridor] 
CHAKOTAY: Not taking any chances, are you? 
JANEWAY: Don't feel singled out. I've asked the Doctor to examine the entire crew. There's no telling how 8472 got their information about Starfleet. From the Borg? Earth? For all we know there's been an impostor on board. 
[Doctor's office] 
EMH: Cell morphology normal, all of your nucleotide sequences are accounted for. You're a hundred percent human. 
CHAKOTAY: That's a relief. And Tuvok? 
EMH: Green blooded Vulcan through and through. Well, two down, one hundred and twenty five to go. 
JANEWAY: You'd better get going. 
CHAKOTAY: Right. I don't want to be late. 
JANEWAY: Just be home before midnight. 
CHAKOTAY: Yes, ma'am. 
[Delta Flyer] 
KIM: I've enhanced this tricorder with a transoptic datalink. It should help you access some of their systems. Type one phaser modified to fire Borg nanoprobes. 
CHAKOTAY: Right. 
PARIS: Do you always arm yourself before a first date? 
KIM: You've never had a date with species 8472. 
PARIS: Personally, I don't go out with girls from other galaxies. 
KIM: You're a true explorer, Chakotay. 
PARIS: Is she cute? 
CHAKOTAY: In her human form, anyway. 
KIM: I've always wondered what it would be like to date an alien. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll take notes. 
PARIS: We're making our approach. 
CHAKOTAY: All stop. Shields up. 
[Medical lab] 
EMH: Feisty little fellows. You've increased their cellular motility by over two hundred percent. 
SEVEN: I thought it would be prudent to maximize their efficiency. 
EMH: Seven, the last time we used nanoprobes we sent 8472 scurrying back to fluidic space. You can't get more efficient than that. 
SEVEN: The species is highly adaptive. It's been over a year since our first encounter. They may have developed a defence against our technology. 
EMH: There's one way to find out. We can test the nanoprobes on our corpse. You'll find the body in morgue chamber three. Beam it to the surgical bay. The creature's only been dead for a few hours, there should still be plenty of cellular activity. 
[Sickbay]
(The corpse is beamed in.)
EMH: Initiate a bio-scan, full spectrum. Don't worry. It's an autonomic reflex. The creature still has residual bioelectric activity in its nervous system. 
SEVEN: Something's wrong. The nanoprobes should have taken effect by now. 
EMH: Hmm. 
SEVEN: What is it? 
EMH: The creature's nucleotides are still intact. It looks like your concerns were warranted. We'll have to inform the Captain. We may have to 
SEVEN: Doctor. 
EMH: False alarm. 
SEVEN: I will replicate more nanoprobes. 
[Doctor's office] 
EMH: I don't mind telling you, Seven, I'm still holding out for a diplomatic solution. 
SEVEN: Improbable. Species 8472 will not respond to diplomacy. 
EMH: Funny. We used to say the same thing about the Borg. My point is, anything's possible if you keep an open mind. Optimism, Seven. Try to look on the bright side. 
SEVEN: It is difficult to be optimistic when we are preparing for battle. 
EMH: Have you ever heard the phrase, the best defence is a good offence? 
SEVEN: No. 
EMH: Throughout human history weapons of mass destruction were often designed in the hopes that they'd never be used. 
SEVEN: And yet, in Earth's Third World War, nuclear weapons accounted for six hundred million casualties. Were they looking on the bright side? 
EMH: An unfortunate exception. 
[Quantum Cafe] 
(Archer and Boothby are sitting at a table.)
ARCHER: We were just talking about you. 
CHAKOTAY: Oh? 
BOOTHBY: She didn't think you were going to show up. 
ARCHER: Boothby! 
BOOTHBY: I've known Archer since she was a first year cadet. She's not easily impressed. I didn't think you were her type. Oh, er, if you'll excuse me, I've got some midnight orchids that need my attention. Think about what I said, young lady. You'll be fine. 
ARCHER: Thank you, Boothby. 
(Boothby leaves.)
CHAKOTAY: Problems? 
ARCHER: I was offered a field commission this morning. First officer of the starship HorCha. 
CHAKOTAY: Congratulations. 
ARCHER: It's a Klingon vessel. 
CHAKOTAY: Oh. So what did Boothby say? 
ARCHER: DuCha me gagh roh. Smile when you eat the gagh. 
CHAKOTAY: Wise words. 
ARCHER: Yeah. 
CHAKOTAY: Do you always seek advice from the groundskeeper? 
ARCHER: Half the Captains in Starfleet wouldn't be where they are today if it weren't for Boothby. Lopez, Picard, Richardson, just to name a few. Closing time. 
CHAKOTAY: You offered to be my guide. Where's our next stop? 
ARCHER: Can you dance? 
CHAKOTAY: I've been accused of trying. 
ARCHER: It's Pon Farr night at the Vulcan nightclub. 
CHAKOTAY: Vulcan?
ARCHER: It's just around the corner. 
[Delta Flyer] 
PARIS: Take it easy, Harry. We didn't build the Delta Flyer to withstand such extensive pacing. 
KIM: He should have contacted us by now. 
PARIS: Give him time. 
KIM: Four hours? 
PARIS: It's a date. These things can't be rushed. They probably just finished dinner, a couple of drinks, and now they are moving past the polite stage. 
KIM: Polite stage? The last 8472 I met tried to dissolve me from the inside out. 
PARIS: It was only trying to get to know you better, Harry. You can't fault a person for that. Look, Chakotay can take care of himself. And if he can't, who better than us to come to the rescue? 
[Archer's quarters] 
CHAKOTAY: Turns out the transporter malfunctioned. My uniform ended up in the pattern buffer. 
ARCHER: You're kidding. You were naked? 
CHAKOTAY: Not entirely. I had my commbadge. 
ARCHER: I hope it was well-placed. Computer, lights. 
CHAKOTAY: So this is where they're putting up officers nowadays. Not bad. 
ARCHER: Can I get you something to drink? 
CHAOTAY: Water's fine. 
ARCHER: I'm beginning to think you're a teetotaller. 
CHAKOTAY: I like to stay in control. 
ARCHER: Always at yellow alert, huh? 
CHAKOTAY: Something like that. 
ARCHER: Find anything interesting? 
CHAKOTAY: Beyond the Galactic Edge, Humanity's Quest for Infinity. This is a 21st century edition of Hesterman, isn't it? 
ARCHER: Replicated. Good book though. 
CHAKOTAY: Never read it. 
ARCHER: You should. Human beings, they're quite a paradox. 
CHAKOTAY: Oh? How so. 
ARCHER: At first glance, they're so primitive. Genetic impurities, no telepathy, violent and yet they've created so many beautiful ways to communicate their ideas. Literature, art, music. At times, I've actually enjoyed being in this form. You must think I'm crazy. 
CHAKOTAY: Not at all. 
ARCHER: I wonder what they think about us? 
CHAKOTAY: Hard to say. 
ARCHER: I'll tell you what I think. They despise us. They'll attack any species that's not part of their Federation. Mmm. Speaking of being in human form. I could use an isomorphic injection. You need one? 
CHAKOTAY: I'm fine. 
ARCHER: Make yourself at home. (She goes into the next room, and Chakotay taps a small computer on a shelf into life and starts downloading the data to his tricorder. Archer returns in a bathrobe, and injects her thigh. The skin wibbles. He turns the computer off and goes to the picture window.)
ARCHER: Commander. How do you like the view? 
CHAKOTAY: Lovely. 
ARCHER: Looks like a full moon. You can see the entire bay on a night like this. 
CHAKOTAY: I should have brought my holo-imager. You make a pretty picture. 
(They go outside.)
ARCHER: Mmm, feel that? Salinated oxygen molecules, stimulating the epidermal and neural receptors. Non-fluidic space has its charms. 
CHAKOTAY: No argument there. 
ARCHER: Planet Earth. The simulation will be real soon enough. 
CHAKOTAY: How soon do you think? 
ARCHER: Weeks, days. As soon as they think we're ready. 
CHAKOTAY: Can I be honest with you? 
ARCHER: Please. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm starting to wonder if all this is worth the effort. 
ARCHER: What do you mean? 
CHAKOTAY: This simulation, our mission. Are we certain the humans pose a threat? 
ARCHER: They were allies with the Borg. They invaded our realm. 
CHAKOTAY: That was one incident. That doesn't mean the entire Federation is planning a war against us. 
ARCHER: We can't trust them. We have to prepare for the worst. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm not so sure. 
ARCHER: I think you've been human a little too long. 
CHAKOTAY: Before you know it, I'll be sending my resume to the real Starfleet. 
ARCHER: Alien from distant galaxy seeks employment. References available upon request. 
CHAKOTAY: Well, it's getting late. I'd better go. 
ARCHER: Already? 
CHAKOTAY: I have a tactical report to finish before morning. 
ARCHER: Aren't we forgetting something? I'm no expert at human dating rituals, but I think it's customary to kiss good night. You've never done this before. 
CHAKOTAY: Actually. 
ARCHER: Me, neither. Just think of it as part of our training. 
(She backs him up against the door jamb and kisses him. Then Chakotay reciprocates enthusiastically, and leaves.Archer goes to her desk and takes out a scanner. She uses it 
on her hand where it had touched Chakotay's skin, and activates her desk computer.)
BOOTHBY [on monitor]: Report. 
ARCHER: I analysed his DNA. Your suspicions were correct. 
BOOTHBY [on monitor]: How much does he know? 
ARCHER: It's difficult to say. He'll have to be interrogated. 
BOOTHBY [on monitor]: Where is he? 
ARCHER: By now he should be in the main quad. I recommend we go to daylight. He'll be easier to track. 
[Starfleet Headquarters - gardens] 
(Night suddenly becomes day. Four people are following him.)
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Paris. Delta Flyer, respond! (He shoots a man who is running towards him, then runs himself. But soon he is surrounded by humanoid 8472, who grab him and take him away. 
[Ready room] 
JANEWAY: Yes. Come in. 
SEVEN: The Borg modifications are complete. Nineteen standard photon torpedoes and three class tens armed with high-yield warheads. 
JANEWAY: More. 
SEVEN: We ha've depleted our supply of nanoprobes. 
JANEWAY: Replicate a new supply. 
SEVEN: That is not possible. 
JANEWAY: Have the Doctor extract them from your bloodstream. Grow them in a petrie dish. Whatever it takes. If we do engage 8472 I don't intend to run out of firepower mid-battle. You of all people should understand that. They killed, what, four million drones? Directive zero one zero. Before engaging alien species in battle, any and all attempts to make First Contact and achieve non-military resolution must be made. In this case, we made first contact over a year ago and we barely got out of it alive. It seems to me a battle is inevitable, maybe even war. So why can't I get that directive out of my mind? 
SEVEN: This species intends to purge our galaxy of all life. It's time you resisted your Starfleet philosophy.
TUVOK [OC]: Captain to the Bridge. 
[Bridge] 
TUVOK: The away team is hailing us. 
JANEWAY: Tom. 
PARIS [on viewscreen]: Chakotay's in trouble. He tried to contact us ten minutes ago, but his signal was cut off. 
KIM [on viewscreen] Some kind of forcefield went up around the habitat. We can't get a lock on him.
JANEWAY: Has your vessel been detected? 
PARIS [on viewscreen]: I don't think so. At least, no one's tried to take a shot at us yet. 
JANEWAY: Hold your position. Keep trying to locate him. We're on our way. 
PARIS [on viewscreen]: Yes, ma'am. 
JANEWAY: Bring those Borg weapons online. Red alert. All hands to battle stations. Take us out of orbit. 
[Quantum Cafe] 
ARCHER: I thought you had a tactical report to finish. 
BOOTHBY: What'll you have, son? I'm a single malt man, myself. Aged two hundred years. Been saving it for a special occasion, and I'd say this is special enough. A toast. To Earth. Chakotay. Rank, Commander. Starfleet service number forty seven alpha six one two. First officer, USS Voyager. 
CHAKOTAY: Species 8472. Origin, fluidic space. 
BOOTHBY: Well, now that we've been formally introduced, how many ships? Cat got your tongue? I asked you a question. How many vessels do you have in the Delta Quadrant? 
CHAKOTAY: One. 
ARCHER: How did you find us? 
CHAKOTAY: We detected what looked like a Federation subspace transmission. It took us weeks to track it here. 
BOOTHBY: We wanted this simulation to be accurate to the last detail. We obviously went a little too far. Now that you know about our re-creation, you've no doubt alerted the Federation. Your fleet will be on its way. 
CHAKOTAY: You've got it wrong. We're not planning a war against you. 
ARCHER: Is that why you were here to spy on us, because you're curious? 
BULLOCK: Sir, a starship is approaching. It's Voyager. 
BOOTHBY: Raise our shields. Stand by, all weapons. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain Janeway is not here to launch an attack. She's here to find me. 
BOOTHBY: We've got the real McCoy here. We might as well take advantage of it. Perform a genetic extraction. It may help us find a better way to maintain these human forms. 
ARCHER: Yes, sir. 
[Bridge] 
TUVOK: We are approaching the habitat. 
JANEWAY: Shields to maximum. Charge weapons. All hands, this is the bridge. Tactical alert. Report to your posts and stand by to engage the enemy. 
TUVOK: I have a visual. We're being scanned. 
JANEWAY: Let them take a look. 
SEVEN: The Delta Flyer is heading up from the habitat. 
JANEWAY: Open a channel. Tom, status?
PARIS [OC]: They've taken a couple of pot-shots at us, Captain. We've lost our shields. Mind if we join you? 
JANEWAY: You're clear to dock. Shuttlebay two. Any word from Chakotay? 
PARIS [OC]: I'm afraid not. 
JANEWAY: Bring us within range. Target their weapons array. 
SEVEN: Captain, we should target their power systems as well. 
JANEWAY: No, I don't want to risk shutting down their life support. If we can end this without casualties, so much the better. 
SEVEN: This species does not deserve our compassion. 
JANEWAY: You picked a lousy time for an ethical debate. The weapons array. Now.
TUVOK: We're entering weapons range. Thirty eight hundred kilometres. Thirty five hundred. Thirty two hundred. 
[Quantum Cafe] 
CHAKOTAY: Valerie. 
ARCHER: That's not my name. 
CHAKOTAY: Then what is it? You're afraid of us, aren't you. You think we're violent, that we're planning to destroy your species, but none of that's true. If you would take the time to speak to us directly, we could prove it to you. There are no secrets except the secrets that keep themselves. 
ARCHER: Shaw. 
CHAKOTAY: George Bernard Shaw. I saw a copy of his Collected Works on your bookshelf. 
ARCHER: He had a complex mind, for a human. 
CHAKOTAY: And he had a point. As long as we keep spying on each other, making assumptions, we probably will go to war. 
(A klaxon sounds.)
ARCHER: Voyager. 
[Bridge] 
SEVEN: They're charging weapons. 
JANEWAY: Do the same. 
TUVOK: We're being hailed. 
JANEWAY: Mister Boothby. 
BOOTHBY [on viewscreen]: Captain Janeway. 
JANEWAY: Good to see you after all these years. Enjoying the Delta Quadrant? 
BOOTHBY [on viewscreen]: Don't get sassy with me, young lady. This re-creation may be Starfleet but our weapons are far more sophisticated. I can destroy your vessel with a single command. Run along now. 
JANEWAY: I'm not going anywhere. Not until you return my First Officer and give me a damn good explanation for what you're doing in our galaxy. I've targeted your re-creation with Borg nanoprobes, and we're willing to use them if you force us to. 
BOOTHBY [on viewscreen]: Don't try to rattle my cage. I'll disable your tactical systems before you can
JANEWAY: The last time our species engaged in battle, you suffered heavy casualties. Are you willing to take that chance again? An armed conflict isn't going to solve our problems. We could go on making threats, spying on each other, risking a war between our species. Or we could try a more direct approach. 
BOOTHBY [on viewscreen]: What do you have in mind? 
JANEWAY: How about a class reunion? 
[Briefing room] 
BOOTHBY: Targ manure! United Federation of Planets, tolerance for all species, the Prime Directive. Targ manure, every word of it. 
TUVOK: Your metaphor is colourful, but inaccurate. 
BOOTHBY: Vulcan logic. Add that to the list. 
JANEWAY: Obviously, you've studied a Starfleet database. You must have learned something about our history. We adhere to our directives. 
BULLOCK: High-minded ideals are one thing, but your actions tell a very different story. You infiltrated our re-creation, captured and killed one of our people. 
JANEWAY: I told you, he took his own life. 
BULLOCK: You created biological weapons to infect our species. You are allies with the Borg. 
BOOTHBY: There's a drone sitting at this very table. Look at her, all gussied up to look like a human being. 
SEVEN: I am no longer part of the Collective. 
BOOTHBY: Once a Borg, always a Borg. 
JANEWAY: Seven of Nine is a member of this crew. 
BULLOCK: The Borg are irrelevant. It's the humans that pose a threat. 
CHAKOTAY: They think the Federation is a hostile invasion force out to destroy their species. 
JANEWAY: I see. So you're planning a pre-emptive strike against Earth. 
BOOTHBY: Maybe I am. 
JANEWAY: You realise I can't let that happen. 
BOOTHBY: Go ahead, fire your damn nanoprobes. Blow our re-creation to high heavens. There are a dozen more scattered throughout the quadrant. You'll never find them all. 
JANEWAY: What if I told you that Starfleet isn't planning an invasion? That no one on Earth has even heard of you? 
BOOTHBY: I'd say you're lying. 
JANEWAY: Have another look at that Federation database of yours. You'll see there's no mention of your realm. 
BULLOCK: Immaterial. Any information regarding our species has no doubt been classified by Starfleet intelligence. 
JANEWAY: Good point. You know, we could keep this paranoid debate going all day. You have no reason to trust us and we have no reason to trust you. 
BOOTHBY: Hear, hear. I knew this reunion would be a fiasco. Admiral. 
JANEWAY: Seven, disarm the warheads Do it, 
SEVEN: Captain? 
JANEWAY: Do it.
(Seven goes to the wall monitor and complies.) 
BOOTHBY: What are you trying to prove, young lady? 
JANEWAY: One of us has to take our finger off the trigger. It might as well be me. 
ARCHER: Their weapons are offline. 
BULLOCK: It's a trick. 
JANEWAY: Our defences are down. What will you do now? Blow Voyager to high heavens, or do we keep talking? 
BOOTHBY: Humans. You've got a flair for the dramatic, I'll give you that. You want to keep talking? Fine by me, but no more beating around the bush. Now, what do you want from us? The truth, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Voyager is alone in the Delta Quadrant. We haven't been in contact with Earth for over four years. 
BOOTHBY: Explain why you attacked our realm, hand in hand with the Borg. 
JANEWAY: At the time, we didn't realise the Borg had started the war against you. We forged a temporary alliance with them because we thought you were the threat. 
SEVEN: Your galaxy will be purged. Sound familiar? 
BULLOCK: We were only trying to defend ourselves. 
TUVOK: If that's true, why are you still in our galaxy? Your conflict with the Borg ended over a year ago. 
JANEWAY: Why re-create Starfleet, masquerade as humans? It looks to me like you're the ones planning an invasion. The truth. 
BULLOCK: Don't answer her. She's manipulating us. 
ARCHER: If you won't answer, I will. 
BULLOCK: Commander.
ARCHER: Our mission is to infiltrate your home world, to place operatives in the highest levels of Starfleet, monitor your military installations. It's a reconnaissance mission, nothing more. 
CHAKOTAY: We should listen to her, Captain. They're being driven by fear just like we are. Unless everything you said on our date was just part of an act. 
ARCHER: It wasn't. 
BULLOCK: Enough! We must not negotiate with these creatures. 
BOOTHBY: Sit down, Admiral. 
BULLOCK: Sir. 
BOOTHBY: I said sit down, or I'll knock you right on your human butt. 
BULLOCK: You've been seduced by them, both of you. 
ARCHER: I've had a chance to see through human eyes and I'm beginning to wonder, are they really so violent? What if we're wrong? 
BULLOCK: We can't risk trusting them. 
ARCHER: You'd rather risk another war? 
BOOTHBY: Keep talking, son. 
CHAKOTAY: Archer's right. We've got to set aside our preconceptions about each other. Granted, our species didn't meet under the best of circumstances, but maybe we can make first contact again. Maybe this time we'll get it right. 
BOOTHBY: You believe in this fellow? 
ARCHER: Yes. 
BOOTHBY: There would have to be a few ground rules. 
JANEWAY: Name them. 
BOOTHBY: First off, I want to take a look at that nanoprobe technology. It scares the hell out of me. 
JANEWAY: All right, but I'll need some tactical information in return. Your genetic alteration techniques for a start. 
BOOTHBY: I'm sure something can be arranged. You on board, Admiral? Good enough for me. 
Captain's log, stardate 52136.4. We've managed to avoid a military conflict with Species 8472, at least for now. In an effort to strengthen the truce, we're exchanging technology. 
[Corridor] 
SEVEN: The design schematic for our nanoprobe weapons as requested. 
JANEWAY: This could go a long way toward allaying their fears. 
SEVEN: Perhaps. 
JANEWAY: Have a little faith, Seven. 
SEVEN: It's difficult to have faith in an idea which may prove tactically unsound. 
JANEWAY: Tactically unsound? Perhaps. It could also be the first step toward peace. It's a risk I'm willing to take. Are you sure you won't join us? It would be your first chance to see Earth. 
SEVEN: I prefer to remain aboard Voyager. If problems arise while you're in the habitat
JANEWAY: There won't be any problems. Nothing tactical, at any rate. We're entering a stage of diplomacy where most of the problems will be cultural. How do you shake hands with an 8472? We'll be fine. 
SEVEN: When you ordered me to disarm the warhead during the negotiation, I anticipated an immediate attack. I believed they would take advantage of your human weakness. I was wrong. If I had been in your position, we would most likely be engaged in a battle with 8472 at this moment. How did you know? 
JANEWAY: I didn't. Like I said. 
SEVEN: Faith. 
[Starfleet Headquarters - gardens] 
BULLOCK: Welcome to Terrasphere Eight, Starfleet Command re-creation. I am Admiral Bullock and I'll be acquainting you with our facility. Questions, comments bring them to me. Problems talk to Lieutenant Kinis. Commander Tuvok, you wanted to examine our thermionic generators. 
TUVOK: Yes. 
BULLOCK: I'll take you there personally. Ambassador Nelix? 
NEELIX: It's Neelix, sir. 
BULLOCK: Neelix. You'll be joining the Lieutenant. He'll familiarise you with our environmental control technology. 
NEELIX: Wonderful. I look forward to hearing your perspective on Vulcans. 
(Elsewhere -)
JANEWAY: You didn't happen to re-create a little coffee shop on Market Street, the Night Owl? 
BOOTHBY: Afraid not. You're welcome to stay. put your feet up. We won't be returning to fluidic space for another day or two. 
JANEWAY: Thank you, but the real Earth is a long way from here. I'd like to get back on the road. What are the chances they'll listen to you? 
BOOTHBY: I can't promise you the moon, Captain. My superiors aren't as forward thinking. Peace with humans? Wow. They're going to hit the roof. But I'll tell them what happened here today, and with a pinch of luck a few of them might see the light. 
JANEWAY: Well, you've got Voyager's comm. frequency. You know how to contact us. I hope we can keep this process alive. 
BOOTHBY: Don't call us, we'll call you. Oh, I almost forgot. Ahh. 
(He takes a rose from his bag.)
BOOTHBY: Genetically synthesised, but they smell just as lovely.
JANEWAY: Oh. 
(And elsewhere again.)
CHAKOTAY: Looking forward to going home? 
ARCHER: At least I can finally get out of this form. 
CHAKOTAY: No more insomnia. 
ARCHER: No more sleeping, period. 
CHAKOTAY: For what it's worth, you made a terrific human. 
ARCHER: Shame. 
CHAKOTAY: Hmm? 
ARCHER: It's too bad our species are so different, otherwise I'd ask you for a second date. 
CHAKOTAY: You did offer to be my guide. How about a tour of your realm sometime? 
ARCHER: I'd like that. 
CHAKOTAY: Well, I'm due back on Voyager. We leave at oh four hundred. 
ARCHER: I'll never get a chance to do this again. 
(Kissing, long and slow.)
ARCHER: Any better this time? 
CHAKOTAY: You're a quick study.
