Shattered
[Cargo Bay two] 
(Naomi is sitting on the floor doing a jigsaw of a double helix.)
NAOMI: Hmm. There. 
ICHEB: Excellent. You recognized the complementary base pair. 
NAOMI: Actually, I just found two pieces that fit together. 
ICHEB: You're missing the point. 
NAOMI: I thought the point was to finish the puzzle. 
ICHEB: And learn something about genetics. 
NAOMI: If you really want to help, find me a green piece that looks like Tuvok's ear. 
(Chakotay enters.)
ICHEB: Commander. 
CHAKOTAY: At ease. I'm just passing through. 
ICHEB: I apologise for the condition of the Cargo Bay, sir. I've been tutoring Naomi. 
CHAKOTAY: Looks like you found a creative approach. 
(Chakotay opens a case.)
ICHEB: Thank you, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell Seven. I'm supposed to be writing a paper on transwarp instability. 
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, your secret's safe, as long as you keep mine. 
(Chakotay takes a slim bottle from the case.)
ICHEB: Sir? 
CHAKOTAY: Antarian cider. Not the replicated stuff. There are only a couple of bottles left and I don't want Mister Neelix getting his hands on them. 
ICHEB: Then you should store them with the salvaged Borg components. Neelix never inventories those containers. He says they give him the creeps. 
CHAKOTAY: Officer-level thinking, Icheb. Would you mind? 
ICHEB: Of course not. 
[Janeway's quarters] 
Janeway has the replicator in pieces on the floor, like a jigsaw, when the doorbell chimes.)
JANEWAY: Come in. 
(Chakotay enters with the bottle of cider.)
JANEWAY: You're late. Unfortunately, so's dinner.
CHAKOTAY: Let me guess. You burned the roast again. 
JANEWAY: Once, a long time ago, I called this replicator a glorified toaster. It never forgave me. 
CHAKOTAY: I didn't realise replicators held grudges. 
(He hands her a glass of cider.)
JANEWAY: What's so funny? 
CHAKOTAY: I just left Icheb and Naomi assembling a jigsaw puzzle in the Cargo Bay. 
JANEWAY: Find me the thermal regulator, please. How is Icheb? 
CHAKOTAY: In a few years, he may be running the ship. 
JANEWAY: I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to retire just yet. 
(Whumph!) 
JANEWAY: Janeway to the bridge. Report. 
[Bridge] 
KIM: That was some kind of gravimetric surge. 
[Janeway's quarters] 
KIM [OC]: It's overloading our inertial dampers.
JANEWAY: Source? 
KIM [OC]: That's a good question. 
[Bridge] 
KIM: Seven's trying to localise it. 
[Corridor] 
KIM [OC]: Engineering says the warp core's destabilising. 
CHAKOTAY: I'd better get down there.
(Janeway goes into the turbolift.) 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: A spatial rift is opening directly ahead of us. 
[Bridge] 
SEVEN [OC]: It's emitting high levels of neutrinos and chronotons. 
KIM: On screen. 
JANEWAY: What is it? 
KIM: I don't know.
(A nebula full of energy like sharp teeth.) 
[Engineering] 
TORRES: We're losing containment. Everyone out! 
(Chakotay goes to the warp core railing and works a panel. Energy hits Voyager and he gets zapped. Voyager goes slightly transparent, and Chakotay's skin glows, then half his face becomes very wrinkled.) 
TORRES: Torres to the Transporter room. Beam Commander Chakotay to Sickbay, now! 
[Sickbay] 
(A healthy Chakotay wakes up on a biobed.)
EMH: Welcome back. Lie still. 
CHAKOTAY: What happened? 
EMH: You were transported here. Your body was in a state of temporal flux. 
CHAKOTAY: Temporal flux? 
EMH: You had the liver of an eighty year old man, and the kidneys of a twelve year old boy. Fortunately, I was able to create a chronoton-infused serum that brought you back into temporal alignment. Anywhere else, that antidote would've earned me a prestigious award. Of course on Voyager, it's just another day in the life of an under appreciated EMH. 
CHAKOTAY: What about the rest of the crew? No other casualties? 
EMH: Not that I'm aware of. I've tried calling the bridge, but no one answers. Were we attacked? 
CHAKOTAY: I don't think so. We ran into some sort of anomaly. 
EMH: Naturally, no one thought to inform me. What do you think you're doing? 
CHAKOTAY: Leaving, and you're going with me. 
EMH: I am? 
CHAKOTAY: There may be other injured crewmen. 
(Chakotay picks up a medkit.)
EMH: In case you've forgotten, I'm a prisoner of these walls. 
CHAKOTAY: Where's your mobile emitter? 
EMH: My what? 
CHAKOTAY: I'll be back. 
EMH: Wait. Tell me about this mobile emitter. 
[Turbolift] 
CHAKOTAY: Bridge. 
(A couple of decks up, Chakotay passes through a wibble and the medkit vanishes.) 
[Bridge - pre-Caretaker] 
CHAKOTAY: Harry, what's going on? 
KIM: Sir? I'm afraid I don't know you. 
(Janeway stands up, She is wearing her old Bun of Steel.)
JANEWAY: Take him into custody. How did you get aboard this ship? 
CHAKOTAY: Kathryn? 
JANEWAY: Oh, I didn't realise we were on a first name basis. 
ANDREWS: We should've known the Maquis were involved. 
CHAKOTAY: Maquis? Involved in what? 
JANEWAY: Just when we're about to chase your ship into the Badlands, our systems start malfunctioning and, you step off the turbolift. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I know this may be hard to believe but I think I've somehow been thrown seven years into Voyager's past. 
JANEWAY: Really? Let's try another theory. You learned Voyager had been assigned to capture you, and you managed to get on board to sabotage her. 
CHAKOTAY: Check your sensors. See if they're showing any strange temporal readings. 
KIM: Captain, the environmental controls are fluctuating. 
JANEWAY: Take him to the brig. 
[Turbolift] 
(A couple of decks down, and the guards vanish.) 
CHAKOTAY: Halt turbolift. Engineering. 
[Engineering - Basics] 
CHAKOTAY: Seska! 
(A Kazon hits Chakotay in the face with his rifle-butt. Later, he wakes up with a nasty cut on his forehead.)
SESKA: Hold him still. 
(She heals the cut.) 
SESKA: You didn't really think I'd hurt you, did you?
CHAKOTAY: How'd you get here? 
SESKA: Don't tell me that little bump gave you amnesia. It's time you accepted that I'm in control of Voyager now. 
CHAKOTAY: (to himself) That was five years ago. 
SESKA: What are you talking about? 
CHAKOTAY: Listen, Seska. There's some kind of temporal anomaly going on here. 
(She slaps his face.)
SESKA: I want to know how many more of your people are back on board. 
CHAKOTAY: All right, I'll tell you. I've got a dozen officers with me. We've already locked you out of every key system. In less than an hour, we'll be in control again. 
SESKA: In less than a minute you're going to be dead if you don't give me access to those systems. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll need to use that console. 
SESKA: Just don't do anything you'll regret. 
RULAT: Move. 
(Rulat pushes Chakotay towards the warp core. Chakotay turns, punches him, grabs rifle and starts firing, including at the warp core controls.) 
SESKA: Stop him! 
COMPUTER: Warning, coolant system breached. 
(Chakotay climbs the ladder to the upper level.)
SESKA: Don't make me kill you! (
(Chakotay throws the rifle ahead of himself and sees it disappear. He follows it quickly. Seska cannot see him from below but he can see her from above. A Kazon goes towards the ladder.) 
SESKA: No. Scan the perimeter report any anomalous readings. There's something wrong here. 
[Sickbay - pre-Tuvix] 
(The Jefferies tube hatch opens.)
EMH: Whoever you are, I suggest you surrender. I'm armed. 
CHAKOTAY: It's only me, Doc. 
EMH: Commander, please tell me what's going on. 
CHAKOTAY: If you tell me the stardate. 
EMH: 49624. 
CHAKOTAY: No wonder you didn't know about the mobile emitter. You don't get it for another year.
EMH: I don't understand. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I get it myself, but the ship seems to have been fractured somehow. 
EMH: Fractured? 
CHAKOTAY: Different areas seem to exist in different time periods. 
EMH: How many of these time periods are there? 
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure. On the bridge, it's before Voyager even left the Alpha Quadrant. In Engineering, it's the time when the Kazon took over the ship. 
EMH: Kazon? We've got to protect ourselves. 
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry. So far I'm the only one who can cross from one zone into another. That serum you gave me. It must've made me immune. Normal technology won't pass through the barriers. Can you replicate a chronoton-infused hypospray casing using the same principles you used to make the serum? 
EMH: I think so. Why? 
CHAKOTAY: I have to take some of it with me. 
EMH: What for?
CHAKOTAY: If I'm going to put the ship back together again, I need help. 
[Bridge - pre-Caretaker] 
(Chakotay enters.)
KIM: Captain. 
(Kim draws his phaser.) 
JANEWAY: Where are my officers?
CHAKOTAY: The turbolift passed through a temporal barrier. They couldn't get through. If you're willing to hear me out, I can explain. At least partly. 
JANEWAY: You mean about your being from the future. 
CHAKOTAY: Your first Starfleet posting was on the Al-Batani, where you once knocked out power to six decks by misaligning the positronic relays. 
JANEWAY: Nice try, but you could have read that in a Maquis intelligence file.
CHAKOTAY: How's Molly, your Irish Setter? You rescued her from a pound on Taris Seti four. She was the runt of the litter, but you thought she had spunk. You love music, but you never learned to play an instrument. Something you still regret. 
JANEWAY: How do you know these things? 
CHAKOTAY: Because you told me, about three years from now. 
JANEWAY: My ready room. 
[Ready room] 
(Janeway scans the chronoton hypospray.)
JANEWAY: It's a fascinating story. But as the Ferengi say, a good lie is easier to believe than the truth. 
CHAKOTAY: So you're saying no one on your crew has encountered any of these temporal barriers? 
JANEWAY: My helmsman disappeared when she tried to walk down that corridor, but that doesn't prove she passed through a temporal barrier. 
CHAKOTAY: If you inject yourself, I can take you down that corridor and show you everything I've said is true. 
JANEWAY: Have Mister Kim run a full spectral analysis. For all I know, this is poison and Mister Chakotay is trying to assassinate me. 
(Chakotay grabs Janeway and uses her as a shield.)
CHAKOTAY: She's right. It's poison, and I'll use it. 
(He backs them out into the corridor with the hypo at her throat.) 
[Corridor] 
ANDREWS: Let her go. 
CHAKOTAY: Lower your weapon. 
(Chakotay injects Janeway.)
ANDREWS: Captain! 
(Chakotay steps back through the barrier with Janeway, and they disappear.) 
ANDREWS: Andrews to the Bridge. I need help here. 
JANEWAY: Andrews! 
CHAKOTAY: He can't hear you. We've moved into a different time frame. 
ANDREWS: Scan the area but don't go past that bulkhead.
CHAKOTAY: You want more proof? It's right down that corridor. You just have to trust me. 
JANEWAY: It isn't easy when you're holding me hostage. 
CHAKOTAY: Stay or go. it's your choice. 
JANEWAY: Now that I'm inoculated, I can go anywhere on the ship I want? 
CHAKOTAY: That's right. 
JANEWAY: Then I suppose I don't need you anymore.
CHAKOTAY: Without me, you'll be walking into a future that you know nothing about. 
(They walk side by side.)
JANEWAY: Where are we going? 
CHAKOTAY: The Astrometrics lab. 
JANEWAY: Voyager doesn't have an Astrometrics lab. 
CHAKOTAY: Harry designed it, or will design it. 
JANEWAY: Harry Kim? 
CHAKOTAY: I realise from your perspective he's new to the job, but he's going to become one of our best people. 
[Turbolift] 
CHAKOTAY: Deck eight. 
JANEWAY: Our people?
CHAKOTAY: I'm going to be your First Officer. 
JANEWAY: Really. What's the reason we're going to this, er, Astrometrics? 
CHAKOTAY: It has temporal sensors that can help us map the ship and tell us how many timeframes we're dealing with. 
JANEWAY: Now you're trying to tell me Harry Kim invented temporal sensors? 
CHAKOTAY: No. We used Borg technology for that. 
JANEWAY: Borg? 
CHAKOTAY: It's a long story. 
JANEWAY: Maybe you should keep it to yourself. The Temporal Prime Directive. The less I know about the future, the better. 
[Corridor] 
(The ship is at red alert, and crewmen are lying unconscious on the deck.)
JANEWAY: She's got a pulse. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm detecting an active neurogenic field. This could be the day the telepathic pitcher plant put us all into comas. Or it might be the time aliens invaded our dreams. 
JANEWAY: We've got to get them help. 
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, we managed to get out of both situations. 
[Astrometrics lab - 2394] 
ADULT NAOMI: Captain. 
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. I don't recognise you, Lieutenant. 
ADULT NAOMI: It's me, Naomi Wildman, 
ADULT ICHEB: How did you 
CHAKOTAY: Are you Icheb? 
JANEWAY: Something tells me you weren't expecting us. 
ADULT ICHEB: No, ma'am. 
ADULT NAOMI: You both died. 
ADULT ICHEB: Seventeen years ago. 
CHAKOTAY: The Captain and I haven't risen from the grave. The ship's been fractured into different timeframes. 
ADULT NAOMI: Thirty seven to be exact. 
JANEWAY: How did you calculate that? 
ADULT NAOMI: We've had seventeen years to upgrade the sensors. A chrono-kinetic surge interacted with the warp core. 
ADULT ICHEB: It shattered the space-time continuum aboard the ship. 
JANEWAY: The accident that occurred in your timeframe. 
CHAKOTAY: The question is, can we repair the damage? 
JANEWAY: If we could get to a section of the ship that still exists in that time period, maybe we could counteract the surge, stop it from happening. 
ADULT ICHEB: That section was the focal point of the surge. It seems to have been obliterated. 
ADULT NAOMI: It's too bad Seven's not here. 
JANEWAY: Seven? 
CHAKOTAY: Someone who knows more about temporal mechanics than any of us. 
ADULT ICHEB: Unfortunately, she hasn't been found either. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we can find her in another timeframe. 
JANEWAY: I have an Ensign Samantha Wildman on my crew. 
ADULT NAOMI: My mother. 
CHAKOTAY: Naomi was the first child born on Voyager. A few years later, we rescued Icheb from the Borg. 
ADULT NAOMI: When I was little, there was nothing I wanted more than to be the Assistant Captain. 
CHAKOTAY: We should get moving. 
ADULT ICHEB: Commander. In case you were wondering, I never told Neelix where you hid that cider. 
[Corridor] 
JANEWAY: So why are we looking for this Seven in the Cargo bay? 
CHAKOTAY: She spent a lot of time there. 
JANEWAY: Working? 
CHAKOTAY: Regenerating. 
[Cargo Bay two - Scorpion] 
(Plenty of Borg walking around.)
JANEWAY: Maybe you'd better fill me in. 
CHAKOTAY: This looks like the time you forged a temporary alliance with the Borg. 
SEVEN: What's happened to this vessel?
CHAKOTAY: Captain Janeway, meet Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one. 
SEVEN: When a Borg cube travels trough a transwarp corridor, the temporal stresses are extreme. To keep the different sections of the Cube in temporal sync, we project a chronoton field throughout the vessel. 
JANEWAY: How? 
SEVEN: Each Cube has specially designed conduits. If we install similar conduits throughout this vessel, then generate a sufficiently powerful field, we may be able to force Voyager back into temporal sync. 
CHAKOTAY: Temporal sync with what? 
SEVEN: The vessel will return to the moment of the original chrono-kinetic surge. Since the surge will last for six or seven seconds, Commander Chakotay will have a short time in which he could try to counteract the warp core reaction. 
CHAKOTAY: Even if we could replicate these conduits, we'd have no way to get them through the temporal barriers. 
JANEWAY: Bioneural circuitry. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain? 
JANEWAY: It runs through every section of the ship, almost like a nervous system. If we could inject the gel packs with your serum, we could use them to transmit the chronoton field. 
SEVEN: The warp core could be recalibrated to generate that field. 
JANEWAY: Work on it. Chakotay and I will see about modifying the serum. 
SEVEN: Your plan is inefficient. 
JANEWAY: Why? 
SEVEN: There are only two of you. If I were to assimilate you into a small Borg Collective, you could then assimilate others. The work would proceed more rapidly.
JANEWAY: Sorry, but I like my plan better. We'll be back. 
[Corridor] 
JANEWAY: That was an interesting experience. 
CHAKOTAY: If it makes you feel any better, you're going to develop quite a knack for dealing with the Borg. 
JANEWAY: You mean we're going to be seeing more of them? 
CHAKOTAY: We'll run into them on a few occasions. 
JANEWAY: Why do I get the feeling that's an understatement? It doesn't seem like my first command is shaping up the way I expected. 
CHAKOTAY: In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself astray in a dark wood, where the straight road had been lost. 
JANEWAY: I didn't know Dante's Inferno was on the Maquis reading list. 
CHAKOTAY: Actually, I borrowed your copy. 
JANEWAY: My fianc� gave me that book as an engagement gift. I've never lent it to anyone. 
CHAKOTAY: Not yet. Anyway, I agree with Dante. If you always see the road ahead of you, it's not worth the trip. 
JANEWAY: A soldier and a philosopher. Your intelligence file doesn't do you justice. 
[Sickbay - pre-Tuvix] 
(Janeway tries to adjust an ammo belt.)
EMH: I've replicated these belts to resist the effects of the temporal barriers, just like the hyposprays. 
JANEWAY: I didn't realise you were programmed to be so versatile. 
EMH: I wasn't, but when you're thrown into the deep end of the galaxy and left running for as long as I've been, it helps to develop a few extra subroutines. 
JANEWAY: How long have you been running? 
EMH: Almost three years, since our original doctor was killed. 
JANEWAY: Killed? How? 
EMH: In the incident that stranded us here in the Delta 
CHAKOTAY: Doctor. The Temporal Prime Directive, remember? 
EMH: Of course. I'm sorry.
(The EMH goes into his office.) 
JANEWAY: The Delta Quadrant? Is that what he was about to say? 
CHAKOTAY: Ready? 
JANEWAY: I'll take the upper decks, you take the lower. 
CHAKOTAY: I don't think splitting up's a good idea. 
JANEWAY: We'll get the job done faster. 
CHAKOTAY: As your First Officer, it's my duty to protect you. I know a lot more about what's out there than you do, and we have no way of communicating if something goes wrong. It may take a little longer, but we should go together. 
JANEWAY: After you, Commander. 
[Corridor] 
(They open a panel to reveal two gel packs.)
JANEWAY: Can I ask you something? I started out with a crew of a hundred and fifty three. I already know I lost my doctor. How many others? 
CHAKOTAY: We'll suffer casualties like any other starship. But you'll also gain new crewmen as well. 
JANEWAY: Like you. How do you get to be my First Officer? 
CHAKOTAY: Our crews will be forced to work together after we get stranded. 
JANEWAY: In the Delta Quadrant? How does that happen? 
CHAKOTAY: Are you sure you want to know? 
(They each take a vial from their ammo belt and put it into a hypospray, then inject the gel packs. A macrovirus from Macrocosm comes around the corner.) 
CHAKOTAY: Run! 
(They pass through a barrier.)
JANEWAY: What the hell was that? 
CHAKOTAY: A macrovirus. They infected the ship a few years ago. 
JANEWAY: Sounds like it's going to be one disaster after another on this ship. 
CHAKOTAY: You once told me that Starfleet captains don't choose their missions, the missions choose them. You're going to have the opportunity to study things no human has ever seen before. 
JANEWAY: Including some very large germs. 
[Holodeck - after Bride of Chaotica] 
(A cave.)
JANEWAY: A monochromatic environment? 
CHAKOTAY: It's called black and white. It's one of Tom Paris' Holodeck programmes. He based it on some old science fiction serials. 
JANEWAY: Interesting technology. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain Proton's rocketpack. 
JANEWAY: Captain Proton? 
CHAKOTAY: The Saviour of the Universe. 
JANEWAY: Doesn't sound like Mister Paris' tastes are very sophisticated. 
CHAKOTAY: That's why we love having him around. The access port should be in there. 
(The cave turns out to be Chaotica's secret laboratory.
JANEWAY: Here. I think I found the panel. Give me a hand. 
(They move some small rocks.)
LONZAK: Halt, in the name of Chaotica! Seize them! 
JANEWAY: Oh, no. 
CHAKOTAY: Computer, deactivate programme. 
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. 
ROBOT: Surrender. 
COMPUTER: Holodeck controls are offline. 
JANEWAY: Hold on. Now wait a minute. 
LONZAK: Thieves, my liege. 
(Satan's Robot grabs Janeway from behind, pinning her arms.)
ROBOT: Do not resist. 
LONZAK: They were attempting to rob your laboratory. 
CHAOTICA: Fool! Don't you recognise the Queen of the Spider People? Arachnia, my bride. I knew you'd return to me one day, so I could watch you die. 
(Prolonged maniacal laughter. Lonzak joins in. Janeway rolls her eyes. A short time later, she is tied to a metal bed.) 
CHAOTICA: Raise the Lightning Shield! Power the Death Ray! Her fleet may be lurking nearby! We must defend ourselves. 
JANEWAY: I'm open to suggestions. 
CHAKOTAY: Our best bet is to play along. 
JANEWAY: Don't let me stop you. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm not the one he's in love with. 
(Chaotica holds up a vial of chrono-serum.)
CHAOTICA: Arachnia, you beguiled me once with your foul potions. Did you think you could toy with my affections again? 
JANEWAY: Were these characters always this ridiculous? 
CHAOTICA: If I order Lonzak to pull that lever, you'll never mock me again. 
CHAKOTAY: Arachnia. 
JANEWAY: Please, my liege. I meant it as ridiculous to think I would ever try to deceive you. I've come to warn you of a fiendish plot.
CHAKOTAY: By aliens from the Eighth Dimension. 
CHAOTICA: Eighth? Everyone knows there are only five dimensions. 
JANEWAY: If you don't believe us, examine their handiwork for yourself. There's a hidden panel over there behind those rocks. 
CHAOTICA: Very well. I'll humour you. Lonzak! 
LONZAK: I've found it, Highness. 
CHAOTICA: They've sabotaged my laboratory. 
JANEWAY: That vial you're holding, it's a neutralising potion. If you inject their device, you'll render it harmless. 
(Chaotica injects the gel pack.)
JANEWAY: Release me, and I'll disarm all their devices, throughout your realm. 
CHAOTICA: Oh, Arachnia, you do love me. 
JANEWAY: How could I resist your magnetism? 
CHAOTICA: Or I yours. Together we'll rule the cosmos and grind our enemies into dust.
(Chaotica kisses her hand, then works his way passionately up her arm.) 
[Corridor] 
JANEWAY: If we restore the time line, remind me to cancel Mister Paris' Holodeck privileges. 
[Transporter room - Caretaker] 
(Torres and Ayala are working here, in their Maquis clothes.)
TORRES: What the hell's going on? And what are doing in that uniform? 
CHAKOTAY: It's a little complicated. 
TORRES: I'm not going anywhere. 
CHAKOTAY: Voyager's had an encounter with an anomaly. It's fractured the ship into different time periods. 
JANEWAY: We're trying to undo the damage, but we need access to that panel. 
TORRES: First she destroys our only way out of the Delta Quadrant, and now you're collaborating with her? 
CHAKOTAY: Try to understand. I'm from a time period in your future when all of us will be working together. 
TORRES: That's pretty hard to believe. 
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, I've never lied to you before, and I'm not lying now.
(Chakotay injects the gel packs.) 
[Corridor] 
JANEWAY: That woman blamed me for stranding Voyager in the Delta Quadrant. 
CHAKOTAY: She was angry. 
JANEWAY: But was she right? 
CHAKOTAY: You had good reasons for doing what you did. 
JANEWAY: What reasons? 
CHAKOTAY: You were trying to save lives. 
JANEWAY: Whose? 
CHAKOTAY: An alien culture. The Ocampans. 
JANEWAY: In other words, I'm going to choose to help strangers at the expense of our own people. 
CHAKOTAY: It isn't like you to second-guess yourself. 
JANEWAY: In this case, I'm second-guessing a decision I haven't made yet. 
[Mess hall] 
(In the aftermath of the energy shattering Voyager, it is in its guise as a hospital ward.)
PARIS: Keep dispensing the netrazine until we run out, then switch to the analeptics. 
CREWWOMAN: Yes, Lieutenant. 
PARIS: How did you get in here? 
CHAKOTAY: There isn't time to explain. 
JANEWAY: What happened to these people? 
PARIS: Radiation poisoning. The EPS relays overloaded when we ran into the anomaly. We need the Doctor and medical supplies, or we're going to have a lot more casualties. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid that isn't possible right now. Do the best you can. 
PARIS: Yes, sir. 
CHAKOTAY: There's an access panel in the galley. 
(Chakotay does the injection.)
NEELIX: Coffee, black. 
JANEWAY: How do you know how I like my coffee? 
NEELIX: Well, you haven't changed your standing order in seven years. 
JANEWAY: Thanks. It's just what I needed. 
NEELIX: Don't worry, Captain, you'll get us out of this. You always do. 
CHAKOTAY: All done here. 
TUVOK: Captain. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok? 
(He is badly injured. She takes his proffered hand.)
TUVOK: I am pleased you're here. I didn't think I would see you again. I want you to know it has been an honour to serve with you, and to be your friend. 
JANEWAY: Mister Paris! 
TUVOK: Live long and prosper. 
(Tuvok dies) 
[Turbolift] 
CHAKOTAY: Deck eleven. 
JANEWAY: I can't let this happen. Not again. 
CHAKOTAY: What are you talking about?
JANEWAY: Voyager getting stranded. All these deaths, this entire future, it's my fault. I've got to do something to change it. 
CHAKOTAY: What do you have in mind? 
JANEWAY: Maybe we can find a way to modify Seven of Nine's plan. Put Voyager into temporal sync with my timeframe. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain.
JANEWAY: Now that I know what to expect, I could avoid getting trapped in the Delta Quadrant in the first place. 
CHAKOTAY: Halt turbolift. Seven's plan is dangerous enough. Trying to alter it is too risky. 
JANEWAY: It's worth the risk. 
CHAKOTAY: If Seven's idea works, Tuvok and the other crewman will be fine. 
JANEWAY: They'll still be stuck in the Delta Quadrant. If the temporal anomaly doesn't kill them, something else will. The Borg, telepathic pitcher plants, macroviruses. The Delta Quadrant is a death-trap. 
CHAKOTAY: What about the Temporal Prime Directive? 
JANEWAY: To hell with it. 
CHAKOTAY: With all due respect, it's a little presumptuous to think you have the right to change everyone's future.
JANEWAY: From what I've seen, they'll thank me. 
CHAKOTAY: All you've seen are bits and pieces. You're not getting the whole picture. 
JANEWAY: Really? Just what am I missing? 
CHAKOTAY: It's not what, it's who. People like Seven of Nine, a Borg Drone who'll become a member of this crew after you help her recover her humanity. Or Tom Paris, a former convict, who'll be our pilot, chief medic, and husband to B'Elanna Torres. 
JANEWAY: That angry woman I just met? 
CHAKOTAY: She's going to be your Chief Engineer. Two crews, Maquis and Starfleet, are going to become one. And they'll make as big a mark on the Delta Quadrant as it'll make on them by protecting people like the Ocampans, curing diseases, encouraging peace. Children like Naomi and Icheb are going to grow up on this ship and call it home. And we'll all be following a Captain who sets a course for Earth, and never stops believing that we'll get there. 
JANEWAY: Are you going to be lecturing me like this for the next seven years?
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, you'll always get the last word. 
JANEWAY: In that case, let's get back to work. 
[Corridor] 
JANEWAY: So, who is this Seska? 
CHAKOTAY: She was a member of my crew, who turned out to be a Cardassian spy. She made an alliance with the Kazon and took over the ship. It's all right, we got it back. 
JANEWAY: Sounds like she's not going to be as cooperative as the others. 
CHAKOTAY: I suggest we take a page from your rule book. We try diplomacy. 
JANEWAY: Fine. But the next page in that book says that when diplomacy fails, we need a backup plan. 
CHAKOTAY: Something tells me you already have one. 
[Engineering - Basics] 
CHAKOTAY: We've already injected the gel packs in the other timeframes. That just leaves the ones here. It's in both our interests to work together. 
SESKA: I agree. Let him go. 
RULAT: You believe him? 
SESKA: His story is too preposterous to be a lie. I'll admit it's an ingenious solution. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm glad you're cooperating. 
SESKA: Oh, I believe in cooperation, as long as it benefits me. You know, it's true what they say. 
CHAKOTAY: What's that? 
SESKA: Men just get more distinguished as they get older. A few lines here, a little grey there. It adds character. Too bad their minds start to go. The last time you were here you had that nasty head injury, and you mumbled something about my taking over the ship five years ago. If that's true, then you're from a future time frame, which means that at some point, your crew is going to regain control of Voyager. I can't allow that to happen. Step away from the console. 
(A Kazon drags Chakotay away.)
SESKA: It's an ingenious plan. It just needs a slight modification. 
CHAKOTAY: What are you doing? 
SESKA: Recalibrating your pulse to bring the ship into temporal sync with my time frame. 
CHAKOTAY: That's not possible. 
SESKA: When will you learn to stop underestimating me? 
CHAKOTAY: If you make even the slightest miscalculation you'll destroy the ship and kill everyone. 
SESKA: What other choice do I have? If I can get Voyager into my own timeframe, then I'll be able to ensure that you never retake the ship. Don't worry, I won't hurt you. You can start fresh with me. 
CHAKOTAY: Sorry, that's not the future I have in mind. 
SESKA: In that case. 
(She nods to the Kazon to ready their weapons.)
SESKA: Goodbye, Chakotay. 
(Janeway, Paris and Kim are watching from the upper level.) 
CHAKOTAY: It's too dangerous. There are too many variables. 
SESKA: You're not pleading for your life, are you? 
JANEWAY: Do it. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm telling you, you're endangering your own life. 
SESKA: I'm touched by your concern. 
(Paris and Kim jump down onto the Kazon and fight with them. Chakotay goes to the panel. Icheb and Naomi enter. Naomi works another control panel and consoles blow up in front of the remaining Kazon. Paris throws a rifle to Janeway as she comes down in the lift. Torres, Ayala and other Maquis come to join the fight. Seska grabs Janeway from behind and uses her as a shield.)
SESKA: Stop! Put down your weapons. 
(A Kazon snatches the rifle from Janeway.)
JANEWAY: Don't listen to her. 
SESKA: Oh, your faithful First Officer isn't going to let you die. Are you? (Chakotay lowers his weapon, and Icheb hands his to a Kazon. Another is taken from Torres.)
SESKA: Very clever, Chakotay, inoculating them with your serum. Now it's time to inoculate my people so we can have access to the rest of the ship. 
CHAKOTAY: I won't do that. 
SESKA: Then you just lost your Captain. 
(Borg Seven of Nine enters. Seska shoots at her but the beam bounces off. Seven quickly disarms her.)
CHAKOTAY: Now drop your weapons. 
JANEWAY: Thanks. 
(A short time later.)
TORRES: Seska and the Kazon are secure in the Jefferies Tube. The last gel packs? 
CHAKOTAY: They're ready. 
JANEWAY: The rest of us should return to our sections. After Chakotay initiates the warp pulse, he should find himself back at the moment Voyager encountered the chrono-kinetic surge. He's only going to have a few seconds to reset the deflector polarity. If the time line is restored, the rest of us should have no memory of what's happened here. So I'd like to thank you now for putting your doubts aside, and helping me put mine aside as well. Good luck to each of you. 
(Everyone leaves.)
JANEWAY: Mind if I ask you one last question? 
CHAKOTAY: Will I have to break the Temporal Prime Directive to answer it? 
JANEWAY: Maybe, just a little. For two people who started off as enemies, it seems we get to know each other pretty well. So I've been wondering. Just how close do we get? 
CHAKOTAY: Let's just say there are some barriers we never cross. 
(They shake hands.)
JANEWAY: See you in the future. 
[Bridge - pre-Caretaker] 
JANEWAY: Ensign? 
KIM: Chakotay should be initiating the pulse in ten seconds. Five, four, three, two 
(A bright light fills Voyager.) 
[Engineering] 
(Chakotay is back where it started.)
CHAKOTAY: Reroute main power to the deflector, and set the polarity to the frequency I'm inputting. 
TORRES: Why?
CHAKOTAY: Have you ever heard of a lightning rod? In about three seconds, we're going to need one. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY: What is it?
KIM: I don't know. Main power's being rerouted to the deflector dish. 
JANEWAY: Who gave that order? 
(Energy from the anomaly hits the deflector and is reflected away. The lights go out.) 
JANEWAY: Damage? 
KIM: The deflector's been burned out, but we're okay. 
(Voyager flies away. Chakotay enters.)
JANEWAY: Do you mind telling me why B'Elanna burned out the deflector dish? 
CHAKOTAY: Actually, I ordered her to do it. 
JANEWAY: Why? 
CHAKOTAY: Trust me, it was better than the alternative. 
JANEWAY: Which was what, exactly? 
CHAKOTAY: I can't tell you. 
JANEWAY: Why not? 
CHAKOTAY: The Temporal Prime Directive. B'Elanna's already got a team working on repairs. What do you say we finish our dinner? 
[Janeway's quarters] 
(After dinner, drinking cider.)
JANEWAY: Forget particle fountains and subspace inversions. There isn't an anomaly scarier than a thunderstorm on the plains, especially when you're six years old. I remember watching a bolt of lightning split an oak tree in my grandfather's yard. I'd climbed it just a few hours before. 
CHAKOTAY: Good timing. 
JANEWAY: So what would've happened if you hadn't turned our deflector dish into a lightning rod? 
CHAKOTAY: We've been down this road before. 
JANEWAY: Have we? 
CHAKOTAY: You wanting answers to questions you shouldn't ask. 
JANEWAY: But something did happen, outside the normal space time continuum. It's strange, thinking there's a piece of your life you don't know anything about. 
CHAKOTAY: Sounds a lot like the future.
JANEWAY: Any predictions? 
CHAKOTAY: Only that in a few minutes this bottle will be empty. 
JANEWAY: Then maybe you should go to the Cargo Bay, grab another one. 
CHAKOTAY: How do you know that's where I keep it? 
JANEWAY: Oh, I can't tell you. 
CHAKOTAY: Why not?
JANEWAY: Temporal Prime Directive.
