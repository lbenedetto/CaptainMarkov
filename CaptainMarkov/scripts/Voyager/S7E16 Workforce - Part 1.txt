Workforce - Part 1
[Power distribution plant] 
(On a modern planet, with a railway bridge running over a wide river through the middle of the city, workers of all races and species are walking down a metal staircase from the station. Janeway is in a blue leather suit. She takes the express lift down to a mid level walkway and into the plant.)
JANEWAY: Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find the supervisor? 
WORKER: Over there. 
JANEWAY: Thank you. 
SUPERVISOR: Your authorisation and licenses please? Level six in thermal dynamics and quantum fusion. Well, Janeway, I'm impressed. 
JANEWAY: Thank you, sir. 
SUPERVISOR: Now if you can just manage to report to your shift on time. 
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, I boarded the wrong transport. I ended up at the Atmosphere Filtration Facility. 
SUPERVISOR: They're always looking for skilled workers. I'm surprised they didn't offer you a job. 
JANEWAY: I promise I won't be late again. 
SUPERVISOR: Well, it's easy to get disoriented when you're new here. I've been in this city all my life and I still get lost on occasion. Now you'll be monitoring the primary reactor coils. They process more than eight thousand 
JANEWAY: Eight thousand metric tons of tylium per second at ninety four percent thermal efficiency. I memorised the specifications. 
SUPERVISOR: Let me know if there's anything you need. You'll find we like to keep our workforce happy. 
JANEWAY: I can already tell it's going to be much better than my last job.
(She goes to her console, then looks around. Later -)
SUPERVISOR: The specifications you asked for. 
JANEWAY: Thanks. 
(She takes the foreign style PADD and taps on a Borg style control panel, then returns to her console.)
COMPUTER: Input error four one five. Command code violation two three zero eight. 
JANEWAY: Come on, shut off that damn alarm and I promise I'll never violate you again. 
(A man puts his finger on a control, and the alarm stops.)
JAFFEN: You almost started a core overload. 
JANEWAY: I would have corrected it. 
JAFFEN: Well I'm sorry for interrupting then, and for eavesdropping. I overheard you talking to your console. 
JANEWAY: It's an old habit. 
JAFFEN: Does it work? 
JANEWAY: I'm not sure this control panel and I speak the same language yet. 
JAFFEN: Well, if you need an interpreter. Jaffen. 
JANEWAY: Kathryn. 
JAFFEN: I work just down there. 
JANEWAY: That's good to know. 
SEVEN: This station doesn't require two operators. 
(Seven is in a tight grey suit, and a slightly different hairstyle.)
JAFFEN: I don't think we've met. I'm 
SEVEN: Employee one three two six, and you're employee eight five eight four. Since you're new here, you may not be fully familiar with the labour protocols, but you should be aware that fraternising is not permitted during work hours. 
JAFFEN: And do you have a number. or maybe a name? 
SEVEN: Annika Hansen. 
JAFFEN: And what exactly is your position here? 
SEVEN: I'm the new Efficiency Monitor. 
JAFFEN: Oh, I didn't know they'd hired one. 
SEVEN: Now that you do, I suggest you return to your station. 
JANEWAY: We weren't fraternising. He was just helping me correct an input error. We're almost finished. 
SEVEN: Do it quickly. 
JANEWAY: Yes, ma'am. 
JAFFEN: I thought we were fraternising. Maybe we could get acquainted after work. There is a little place some of us like to go to. We could get a meal. 
JANEWAY: I can't. 
JAFFEN: You need to talk to someone besides your console. 
JANEWAY: I appreciate the offer, but with this new job I don't really have time to socialise. 
[Bar] 
(Just the bar owner and Paris.)
UMALI: They're always looking for labourers at the Power Distribution Plant. 
PARIS: I had a job there once. Didn't like it much. 
UMALI: Odd. They treat their employees well. How long were you there? 
PARIS: Oh, a while. 
UMALI: It would be very simple for me to find out. 
PARIS: A day. 
UMALI: A day? 
PARIS: Half a day, actually. Give or take an hour. 
UMALI: Not what I'd call an illustrious career. 
PARIS: I don't belong behind a console pushing buttons, But when I heard some of the workers talking about your place, I knew I had to get a job here. 
UMALI: You were terminated, weren't you? 
PARIS: Yes. 
UMALI: That's quite an accomplishment during a labour shortage. What happened? 
PARIS: It's a long story. 
UMALI: I like a long story. 
PARIS: I had a disagreement with the new Efficiency Monitor. She didn't think my work was very 
UMALI: Efficient? 
PARIS: Exactly. 
UMALI: Then why should I hire you? 
PARIS: Well, there's my natural charm and personality. They'd be a real asset around a place like this where you're trying to attract patrons. I mean, look at you. You haven't been able to tear yourself away from me. 
UMALI: There's no one else here. 
PARIS: Please. I really need the work. 
UMALI: You'd better clean those tables over there. This place is going to be filled with hungry workers as soon as the next shift ends. 
PARIS: You won't regret this. 
UMALI: Oh, I'm certain I will. (Later, when the bar is full of workers.)
JAFFEN: All of them about my father and he couldn't understand why I wasn't insulted. Finally I just had to tell him. I'm Norvalen, I don't have a father! 
(A dark man in a green leather outfit slaps the bar and laughs hysterically.)
JAFFEN: It wasn't that funny, Tuvok. 
TUVOK: On the contrary. The man was ignorant of how your species procreates. His attempt to disparage you ultimately humiliated him. Irony is often a source of humour. 
JAFFEN: Yes, well, when you explain it like that, it's not funny at all. 
TUVOK: I also have some humorous anecdotes to share. 
JAFFEN: I'll look forward to hearing them. 
(Janeway enters and goes to a spare table.)
JAFFEN: I thought you didn't have time to socialise? 
JANEWAY: I'm not socialising. I'm reviewing these manuals and having something to eat. 
JAFFEN: Well, I recommend the Latara broth and the section on thermal coefficients. I'll join you. 
JANEWAY: Really, I'm very, very busy. 
JAFFEN: Oh, not to socialise. To, er, help you review the manuals. 
(Paris brings two blue cocktails to a couple at another table.)
PARIS: Here you are. Compliments of the proprietress. 
UMALI: Tom? 
PARIS: I'll be right back. 
UMALI: The proprietress doesn't give away drinks. 
PARIS: Well, I'm just creating customer loyalty. 
UMALI: You've been creating loyalty all night with those two women. I suggest you attend to the other tables. 
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. 
(Umali brings Janeway her plate.)
UMALI: Here you are. 
JAFFEN: Thank you. It looks great. 
(Pregnant B'Elanna Torres enters, also in leather, but looking completely miserable. She looks at the happy people and leaves again.) 
[Staircase and walkway] 
JANEWAY: I can't believe I let you keep me out this late. 
JAFFEN: I felt it was my responsibility to help you study those manuals. 
JANEWAY: Of course. 
JAFFEN: And now that I have, you should be less likely to overload the core. You know, with all this fascinating discussion about thermal co-efficients you never told me where you're from. 
JANEWAY: A planet called Earth. 
JAFFEN: Never heard of it. 
JANEWAY: Oh, a long way from here. 
JAFFEN: What's it like? 
JANEWAY: Overpopulated, polluted, very little work. 
JAFFEN: It sounds like my home world. I guess we're both lucky to be here. 
JANEWAY: It's nice to be in a place where different species get along so well. 
JAFFEN: So, you admit we're getting along. 
JANEWAY: I was speaking in a broader cultural context. 
JAFFEN: I see. 
JANEWAY: There's a lot of violence where I come from. 
JAFFEN: That's too bad. 
JANEWAY: I still haven't adjusted to the weather here. It gets so cold at night. 
SECURITY: It's almost curfew. 
JAFFEN: Yes, sir. We both live right here. 
SECURITY: Good night, then. 
JAFFEN: You know, one of the advantages of living in employee housing is that we can continue sharing ideas even after the work day is over. 
JANEWAY: Is that so? 
JAFFEN: Yes, and I do have a spectacular view of the river from my living quarters. 
JANEWAY: I really have to get to sleep. Maybe another time. 
JAFFEN: I'm sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable. 
JANEWAY: You're not. 
JAFFEN: Well, if you get lonely 
JANEWAY: I'll let you know. 
[Power Distribution Plant] 
(In the middle of a shift, as Janeway is tapping at her console, an alarm sounds.) 
JANEWAY: It wasn't me. 
JAFFEN: It's not an overload. It's time for our inoculations. 
JANEWAY: What inoculations? 
JAFFEN: They're nothing to worry about. Protection against ambient radiation. 
JANEWAY: I didn't realise that was a problem. 
JAFFEN: It's not, as long as you're inoculated regularly. We're lucky to have an employer that concerned about our safety. 
[Inoculation queue] 
MED TECH: Is something wrong? 
TUVOK: Forgive me, but I'm, I'm afraid of injections. 
MED TECH: I assure you, this is painless. 
TUVOK: Is there some other method of administering the medication? 
MED TECH: No, I'm afraid there isn't. 
TUVOK: Very well. 
(Tuvok has a flashback to a previous injection against his will, when he was in Starfleet uniform.) 
MED TECH: We're finished. You can go back to work. Next. 
(Seven is next. Tuvok totters away and leans on a nearby console.)
First Officer's log, stardate 54584.3. Ensign Kim, Mister Neelix and I are returning to Voyager after five days of trading with the Nar Shaddan. 
[Delta Flyer - aft compartment] 
(Kim is on the biobed.)
KIM: In six years I've never been on an away mission worse than this one. 
NEELIX: I don't know how you can say that? The cargo hold is crammed with valuable supplies. 
KIM: And my stomach is crammed with alien parasites doing backflips. 
NEELIX: I guess you shouldn't have drunk that Falah nectar. 
KIM: You insisted I try it. 
NEELIX: The Nar Shaddan consider it a delicacy. To refuse would have insulted them. 
KIM: I didn't hear you insisting that Commander Chakotay try it. 
NEELIX: Commander Chakotay's a vegetarian. 
KIM: It was made from meat? 
NEELIX: More like a meat by-product. 
KIM: I'm going to be sick. 
NEELIX: Not after you drink this. 
KIM: What is it? 
NEELIX: Leola bark tea, to settle even the queasiest of stomachs. 
KIM: Oh, it smells worse than the meat nectar. I'll wait for the Doctor to treat me. At least I'll be sleeping in my own bed tonight. 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Harry, I know you're not feeling well, but I need you and Neelix up here. 
KIM: On our way. 
[Delta Flyer - cockpit] 
NEELIX: Anything wrong, Commander? 
CHAKOTAY: We're at the rendezvous coordinates, but there's no sign of Voyager, and they're not responding to hails. Start scanning on all frequencies. They've got to be out there somewhere. 
KIM: So much for my own bed. 
[Engineering] 
(The EMH has red shoulders on his uniform. The ECH has been activated, and is trying to repair Voyager..) 
EMH: Re-initialise the subspace transponder. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Main computer is failing. 
EMH: Switch to backup processors. 
COMPUTER: Main computer stabilised. 
EMH: Good. Now, let's try this again. Re-initialise the subspace transponder. 
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. 
EMH: Why not? 
COMPUTER: Insufficient power. 
EMH: And they say I'm difficult. Reroute power from the replicator system. 
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. 
EMH: Clarify. 
COMPUTER: Relays to the transponder are fused. 
EMH: Any suggestions? 
COMPUTER: Please restate inquiry. 
EMH: Can the power relays be bypassed? 
COMPUTER: Negative. 
EMH: Then I suppose I'll have to replace them by hand. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Intruder alert. 
EMH: Where? 
COMPUTER: The bridge. 
EMH: How many? 
COMPUTER: Two humanoids. 
EMH: Can you identify them? 
COMPUTER: Negative. Sensor resolution is below twenty percent. 
[Bridge] 
(The ECH sneaks onto the bridge, phaser ready. His wrist beacon reveals two figures in environment suits.) 
EMH: Stop what you're doing and turn around! 
KIM: Take it easy, Doc. It's us. 
EMH: It's good to see some friendly faces. For that matter, it's good to see any faces at all. I'm sorry I haven't gotten life support back online yet, but since I've been the only one aboard it hasn't been a priority. 
CHAKOTAY: What the hell happened? 
EMH: We ran into some problems. 
CHAKOTAY: I can see that. Can you be a little more specific? 
EMH: Of course. About twelve hours after you left on your away mission, things started to go wrong. 
[EMH narrative - Doctor's office] 
EMH [OC]: We hit some sort of subspace mine. 
(The ship shudders, the EMH flickers and dashes into his office.)
EMH: Computer, transfer the EMH to the mobile emitter. Sickbay to bridge. Sickbay to Engineering, please respond. 
EMH [OC]: It wasn't long before I was inundated with casualties, all suffering from tetryon radiation poisoning. Pretty soon the Captain arrived. 
JANEWAY: Doctor, can you treat these people? 
EMH: I can stabilise them, but if we can't contain the radiation 
JANEWAY: Get everyone to the escape pods, quickly. Not you, Doctor. I need you here. 
EMH: Captain? 
JANEWAY: Computer, activate the Emergency Command Hologram. Authorisation Janeway omega three. 
COMPUTER: Command codes transferred. 
JANEWAY: You've wanted this chance for a long time. Now you've got it. 
EMH: Aye, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Try to vent the radiation. The rest of us will get out of the contaminated area and head for the nearest habitable planet. 
EMH: You need medical care. 
JANEWAY: Unless someone answers our distress call we'll have to made do with medkits. We'll rendezvous as soon as it's safe to come back on board. Take good care of Voyager. 
EMH: You can count on me, Captain. 
[EMH narrative - Bridge] 
EMH [OC]: The crew abandoned ship and I began to assess the damage caused by the mine. But before I could even get started with the repairs, I got some unexpected company.
(Whumph!)
EMH: Computer, report. 
COMPUTER: An alien vessel has locked on to Voyager with a tractor beam. 
EMH: Open a channel. This is the Federation starship Voyager. Disengage your tractor beam. 
COYOTE [on viewscreen]: Our scans show no lifesigns aboard your vessel. Identify yourself. 
EMH: I am the Emergency Command Hologram. 
COYOTE [on viewscreen]: Hologram? 
EMH: That's right. Now release my ship. 
COYOTE [on viewscreen]: Your crew's abandoned it. It belongs to me now. 
EMH: I beg to differ. Computer, target the vessel's tractor emitter and fire. 
(The tractor beam is cut off. The other ship starts shooting.)
EMH: Come about, heading nine zero three mark six. Engage at warp two. 
COMPUTER: Warp engines are offline. 
EMH: Evasive pattern beta four. Target the vessel's engines.
(The computers puts holes in those parts of the ship.) 
COMPUTER: Warning. Two vessels approaching bearing three three six mark one. 
EMH: Reverse course. Full impulse. 
[Bridge] 
EMH: I managed to evade the other two ships and hid inside this nebula. I vented the radiation, repaired as many systems as I could, but with no help? Let's just say I'm glad you found me.
KIM: It wasn't easy picking up your homing signal. 
EMH: Well, I had to encrypt it. Every time I left the nebula I detected more ships searching for me. 
CHAKOTAY: Any idea who they are? 
EMH: No, but I've analysed all of their weapons signatures. They match the subspace mine. It was a deliberate attempt to disable Voyager. 
CHAKOTAY: Good thing you were here. 
KIM: What about the rest of the crew? 
EMH: Not a word. 
[Tuvok's memories - Quarren Medical Facility] 
(Tuvok is at the Power Distribution Plant, looking down on Janeway working. He recalls the time when the pair of them were rescued from their escape pods.)
KADAN: Make them comfortable. We're going to treat your injuries. 
JANEWAY: Who are you? 
KADAN: My name is Doctor Kadan. We're in a Quarren Medical Facility. 
JANEWAY: My crew ? 
KADAN: My understanding is that they've all been rescued from their escape pods. 
JANEWAY: Treat my people first. 
KADAN: Everyone will be taken care of. 
JANEWAY: Thank you. 
TUVOK: What is that medication? 
KADAN: An anti-radiation serum. Perfectly safe. 
(Janeway is injected, then an open helmet is placed over her head.)
TUVOK: What are you doing? 
KADAN: She's suffering from dysphoria syndrome. Don't worry, it's treatable. 
(Lights from the helmet shine on her face.)
TUVOK: Release her immediately. 
KADAN: Restrain him. 
TUVOK: Captain! No, no! 
(Tuvok is injected, just as he remembered in the inoculation queue.) 
[Power Distribution Plant] 
(Tuvok approaches Janeway.)
TUVOK: Excuse me. 
JANEWAY: Hi. 
TUVOK: I believe we know each other. 
JANEWAY: You're Tuvok, right? We met last week at the shift briefing. 
TUVOK: Before that. Before we were working here. 
JANEWAY: Oh, I don't think so. I mean, we're obviously not from the same place. 
TUVOK: Still, I believe I know you. From the hospital, perhaps? 
JANEWAY: What hospital? 
TUVOK: I am not certain. We were patients. 
JANEWAY: You must have me confused with someone else. I've never been sick enough to go to a hospital. I'm sorry, I have a lot of work to finish. 
TUVOK: Please, try to remember. It may be important. 
JAFFEN: Is there a problem here? 
JANEWAY: I think it's just a misunderstanding. 
JAFFEN: Tuvok? 
TUVOK: She's right. It's, er, it's, er, a misunderstanding. 
JAFFEN: You don't look well. Maybe you should go to the infirmary. 
TUVOK: No, no, I'm fine. Fine. Er, I'll go back to my station. Sorry to have bothered you. 
(Tuvok leaves.)
JAFFEN: What was that all about? 
JANEWAY: I'm not sure. Strange man. 
JAFFEN: And a terrible joke teller. So, we having dinner tonight? 
JANEWAY: Again? 
JAFFEN: What, you don't like my cooking? 
JANEWAY: No, it's wonderful. It's just 
JAFFEN: I'm a perfectionist. I'm going to keep trying until I make you the perfect meal. 
JANEWAY: And then we stop eating together? I'll have dinner with you, on one condition. I make it. 
JAFFEN: I think I can accept those terms. 
JANEWAY: Good. Now go back to your station before the Efficiency Monitor catches us fraternising. 
[Bar] 
(Torres is sitting alone at a table, reading a PADD.)
PARIS: Can I bring you something else? 
TORRES: No, thank you. 
PARIS: I haven't seen you in here before. 
TORRES: You probably just didn't notice. 
PARIS: Oh, I'd have noticed. 
TORRES: Well, apparently you aren't as observant as you think you are. 
PARIS: Oh, really? 
TORRES: I've been coming in here the same time every day, for the past two weeks. 
PARIS: Well, that explains it. I usually work nights. 
TORRES: Me, too. 
PARIS: At the Power Distribution Facility. You see? I am observant. 
UMALI: Tom, I need you for a moment. 
PARIS: I'll be right there. Listen, you should come back in when you get a night off. It's a lot more fun when there's a crowd. 
TORRES: I don't really like crowds. 
PARIS: Well then, maybe we could get together during the day sometime, take a walk by the river. 
TORRES: I don't think so. 
PARIS: Why not? I'm a very engaging conversationalist. 
(Then he sees her big bump.) 
PARIS: Oh. 
TORRES: Yeah. Still want to get together? 
PARIS: You're married. 
TORRES: No. 
PARIS: Oh. 
TORRES: Enjoy your day. 
First Officer's log, stardate 54597.9. After restoring primary systems, we've left the nebula to try to find the crew. Though there's still a lot of damage, we have been able to reconfigure sensors to detect subspace mines. Ensign Kim's been running continuous scans but there's still no sign of our people. On the bright side, the ships that were searching for us seem to have given up. With only four people on board, repairs are going slowly. 
[Engineering] 
COMPUTER: Power to the secondary propulsion systems has been restored. 
KIM [OC]: Kim to Doctor. Report to Astrometrics. 
EMH: On my way. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
EMH: Any luck? 
KIM: I've scanned ships and planets in eighty three systems. No humans, no Vulcans, no Bolians. 
EMH: Maybe we can increase the range of the sensors by tying them into the main deflector? 
KIM: I've already done that. 
EMH: Oh. Well, we can boost resolution by 
KIM: I appreciate your input, Doc, but I didn't call you down here to help me scan. I'm still feeling kind of queasy from that nectar. 
EMH: I treated you days ago. 
KIM: Whatever you did hasn't worked. Maybe all those command subroutines are compromising your medical abilities. 
EMH: Maybe all that sarcasm is compromising your natural charm. 
[Bridge] 
EMH: I've repaired the deuterium injectors, brought secondary propulsion back online, and soothed Ensign Kim's upset tummy. 
CHAKOTAY: Good work. Why don't you get started on the ruptured plasma conduits on deck ten? 
EMH: Can't you take care of those? 
CHAKOTAY: I beg your pardon? 
EMH: Emergency Command Hologram. Doesn't that suggest my place is here, in Voyager's command centre? 
CHAKOTAY: Look, Doc, I'm impressed with the way you handled yourself while we were gone. But right now we've got to prioritise. 
KIM [OC] : Kim to Chakotay. 
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. 
[[Astrometrics lab] 
KIM: I've found them, Commander. They're on an M class planet. At maximum warp, we can be there in less than three days. 
[Bridge] 
CHAKOTAY: Transfer the coordinates to the helm. I'll be in Astrometrics. Doctor, the command centre is yours. 
[Jaffen's apartment] 
JAFFEN: Mmm, smells good. 
JANEWAY: It's only burnt on the outside. Your cooking console's a little temperamental, huh? 
JAFFEN: Did you try talking to it? 
JANEWAY: Once I cut off the charred part, I'm sure it'll be fine. 
(Jaffen tries a piece.)
JAFFEN: It's good. 
JANEWAY: Really? 
(He shakes his head.) 
JAFFEN: Let's go. 
JAFFEN: Where? 
JANEWAY: I promised you dinner. We'll just have to get it somewhere else. 
JAFFEN: Wait. I'm not really hungry. Are you? 
JANEWAY: No. 
JAFFEN: Let's stay here.
(They kiss passionately.) 
First Officer's log, stardate 54608.6. We've traced the crew's life signs to a large city on a planet called Quarra. Unfortunately, the local officials aren't being very cooperative. 
[Bridge] 
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I have personally interviewed several of the individuals on your crew manifest. None of them know who you are, nor have they heard of a starship Voyager. 
CHAKOTAY: I'd like to speak to them myself. 
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: That's not possible. 
CHAKOTAY: If you're telling the truth, you have nothing to lose by letting us talk to them. 
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Unlike other planets in this system, we grant our guest workers the full protection of our laws. 
EMH: What exactly are you protecting them from? 
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Unscrupulous individuals attempting to acquire skilled labourers. 
EMH: We're not trying to acquire labourers. We're trying to find our friends. 
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Most of your friends have excellent positions in the Central Power Facility in the capital. Why would any of them want to travel thousands of light years to a planet on the other side of the galaxy when they have safe, comfortable lives right here? 
CHAKOTAY: Because it isn't their home. 
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I suggest you look elsewhere to increase your labour supply. And if you attempt to disturb any of our citizens, we will respond with force. 
(Transmission ends.)
CHAKOTAY: Any luck? 
KIM: There's no way to beam them through the shield grid. 
CHAKOTAY: Take us out of orbit. 
EMH: We're not leaving them behind? 
CHAKOTAY: No, but I want these people to think we are. 
[Jaffen's apartment] 
JAFFEN: I hope the cooking console's not being temperamental again? 
JANEWAY: Making a hot drink is one thing I can do. 
JAFFEN You're right. It's good. 
JANEWAY: I told you. 
JAFFEN: What's even better is being here with you. Are you comfortable? 
JANEWAY: The blanket's nice and warm. 
JAFFEN: No, I mean here with me. 
JANEWAY: I can't remember being more comfortable in my life. 
[Bar] 
PARIS: (to barman) Yeah, I'll take care of it.
(He sees Torres sitting on her own again.)
PARIS: Hi. Listen, I get off work in a few minutes. I thought maybe you and I could go 
TORRES: You don't give up, do you? 
PARIS: You don't even know what I was going to say. 
TORRES: Let me guess. You're going to invite me to take a walk by the river, or maybe to your living quarters to admire the view. 
PARIS: Actually I was going to offer to introduce you to some people I met. A couple, expecting their first baby in a few weeks. I thought you might want to get to know some other parents. You know, swap stories, maybe even find a playmate for your baby? If it's a bad idea 
TORRES: No. No, it's nice. 
PARIS: Listen, I'm sorry about the other day. 
TORRES: I'm the one who should be apologising. I shouldn't have assumed 
PARIS: Forget it. 
TORRES: Look, it's rare that I admit I'm wrong so you might as well take advantage of it while you can. It's been hard, being alone with a baby coming. I have a habit of keeping my guard up. 
PARIS: That's understandable. 
TORRES: It's just, a romantic relationship is really out of the question for me right now, and when you started asking 
PARIS: How about a friend? 
TORRES: What? 
PARIS: Well, you said romance is out of the question, but could you use a friend? 
[Astrometrics lab] 
CHAKOTAY: Any progress? 
NEELIX: I've spoken to the captains of eight vessels that left Quarra in the last two weeks. 
EMH: No one knew anything about the crew? 
NEELIX: No, but every one of them asked me if I was looking for employment. Apparently, there's a severe labour shortage throughout this system. There's a lot of competition for workers. 
CHAKOTAY: That Ambassador said most of our people were working at the main power facility. I wonder if they still have any positions to fill? 
NEELIX: I can make some inquiries. Why? 
CHAKOTAY: Because you and I are going to find ourselves jobs. 
EMH: Re-entering orbit might arouse their suspicion. 
NEELIX: Not if we take my ship. 
CHAKOTAY: Good idea, Neelix. 
EMH: Commander, you've spoken directly with several government officials. You could be recognised. 
CHAKOTAY: Isn't reconstructive surgery one of your specialties? 
[Sickbay] 
(Chakotay gains heavy orbital bones and loses the tattoo.)
NEELIX: I still say you should have posed as a Talaxian. We'd have made a striking pair. 
CHAKOTAY: Whiskers make me itch. How did it go? 
NEELIX: As soon as I told the Supervisor our qualifications, he was eager to hire us. He even helped me get a docking permit for my ship. We'll be gainfully employed by tomorrow morning. 
KIM: Here you go, Doc. 
EMH: Give me your hand, Mister Neelix. 
NEELIX: What's this? 
KIM: A sub-dermal transponder. It will allow us to maintain an open comm. link so we can transport you through the shield grid if there's trouble. 
CHAKOTAY: Hold position at maximum transporter range. 
KIM: Aye, sir. 
EMH: I assumed I'd be in charge during your absence, Commander. 
KIM: Excuse me? 
EMH: An Emergency Command Hologram programmed with over two million tactical subroutines outranks an Ensign. 
KIM: A few words to the computer and this Ensign can delete those subroutines. 
EMH: Then you'd be depriving yourself of a skilled leader for the sake of your ego. 
KIM: Oh, my ego? 
CHAKOTAY: Gentlemen. Work it out. 
BOTH: Aye, sir. 
[Power distribution plant] 
SEVEN: Employee eight five eight three. Mister Tuvok. According to my records, you've neglected to report for your last three inoculations. These inoculations are for your protection. A sick worker is not an efficient worker. Report to the infirmary. 
(Tuvok is looking a bit sweaty.)
TUVOK: Seven of Nine. 
SEVEN: What?
TUVOK: Seven of Nine. It's your designation. 
SEVEN: My employee number is eight five eight six. Take your hands off me! 
(Tuvok starts a mind meld.) 
SEVEN: Call security! 
(He shows her herself stepping down from her regeneration alcove.)
TUVOK: I don't believe you are who you think you are. 
(Security drag him away. Janeway goes to Seven.) 
TUVOK: We don't belong here. We don't belong here! This isn't right! We don't belong here! 
(Next day -)
SUPERVISOR: Qualification level three in micro-kinetics. You could use some improvement there. Level five in thermionic conversion. Good, We lost a thermionic specialist yesterday. 
CHAKOTAY: Did he find a better job? 
SUPERVISOR: Health problems. 
(Chakotay looks at a female human worker.) 
SUPERVISOR: Someone you know? 
CHAKOTAY: No, just an unusual species. 
SUPERVISOR: We have a diverse workforce. Our thermionic converters operate on a rotating frequency, so they have to be closely monitored. You'll be required to report your readings to the controller at a regular interval. Any questions? 
(Chakotay has spotted Janeway.)
SUPERVISOR: Are you listening to me? 
CHAKOTAY: Sorry, sir. I'm just excited to be here. 
SUPERVISOR: Carry on. 
(The supervisor leaves. Chakotay goes over to Janeway.)
CHAKOTAY: Kathryn. 
JANEWAY: Yes? 
CHAKOTAY: It's Chakotay. 
JANEWAY: I'm sorry? 
CHAKOTAY: I'm new here. The supervisor said you would be a good person to speak to if I had any questions. 
JANEWAY: What can I help you with? 
CHAKOTAY: Nothing. I just wanted to introduce myself. 
JANEWAY: Oh. What did you say your name was? 
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay. Actually, that's just what my friends call me. My employment file lists my given name, Amal Kotay. 
JANEWAY: Well, whatever your name is, I'm happy to help you any way I can. 
[Quarren Medical Facility] 
TUVOK: No. No.
KADAN: You're experiencing a relapse of dysphoria syndrome. This is going to make you feel better. 
TUVOK: Get away from me.
(They finally manage to inject him.)
[Bar] 
(Paris is behind the counter.)
PARIS: Losing my job there was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
NEELIX: Why's that? 
PARIS: Well, so many rules and regulations. It was like a military operation. 
NEELIX: I know what you mean. Report here, reroute power there. It's almost like serving aboard a starship. 
PARIS: Have you ever done that? 
NEELIX: You're looking at the former captain of his own cargo vessel. 
PARIS: Hmm. Must be quite a life. 
NEELIX: What about you. Ever worked on a ship? 
PARIS: Oh, no. Space travel makes me sick. 
(Torres is with a couple, and laughing.)
NEELIX: So, do you know most of the people that come in here? 
PARIS: A lot of them. This is a great place to work. 
NEELIX: Seems like it. 
PARIS: I could put in a good word for you to my employer. 
CHAKOTAY: Ah, Neelix. 
NEELIX: I was wondering when you'd get here. Amal Kotay, this is my new friend, Tom Paris. 
PARIS: What can I get you? 
CHAKOTAY: That looks good. 
NEELIX: I was assigned to the Primary Fusion Chamber along with Mulchaey and Celes. Neither of them recognised me. 
CHAKOTAY: Let me guess. They really love their jobs. 
NEELIX: It's like they've all been programmed to be happy here. 
CHAKOTAY: It's a safe bet they're not going to leave willingly. 
PARIS: Here you go. 
(Janeway and Jaffen go up to the bar.)
JANEWAY: Hi, how was your first day? 
CHAKOTAY: Not bad. 
JANEWAY: Would you and your friend like to join us? 
CHAKOTAY: That would be nice. 
JAFFEN: Er, actually I was hoping we could eat alone tonight. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe another time. 
JANEWAY: That was rude. 
JAFFEN: I'm sorry, I just, er. There's something I'd like to talk to you about. 
TORRES: Thanks. 
WOMAN: Thank you for joining us. 
PARIS: B'Elanna. I'm due for a break. I'll walk you to the transport. 
TORRES: Stop worrying. I'll be fine. 
PARIS: It's not you that I'm worried about. 
TORRES: The baby will be fine, too. 
(Torres leaves. Neelix and Chakotay follow her out.) 
JAFFEN: So, what I was thinking is. If we were to combine our resources, we would reduce our expenses. 
JANEWAY: Are you asking me to move in? 
JAFFEN: Yes. I know it's impulsive, I know we haven't known each other very long. But things are so easy when we're together, and I just thought I 
JANEWAY: Okay. 
JAFFEN: What? 
JANEWAY: Maybe I'm out of my mind, but let's try it. 
[Street] 
(Neelix is walking behind Torres. Chakotay bumps into her from the front.)
CHAKOTAY: Excuse me. 
TORRES: It was my fault. I should watch where I'm going. 
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna? 
TORRES: How do you know my name? 
CHAKOTAY: What if I told you we were old friends? 
TORRES: That's a ridiculous statement. 
CHAKOTAY: I know it sounds strange, but I can prove it to you. 
TORRES: Look, I'm sorry, but I'm late for work. 
(Chakotay drags her off the street.)
TORRES: Let go of me! 
CHAKOTAY: I'm not going to hurt you. 
TORRES: No. 
(Torres punches Chakotay. Neelix grabs her from behind.) 
TORRES: Security, help! 
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Voyager. We've got B'Elanna. 
[Bridge] 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Lock on to Neelix's signal and transport them to Sickbay. 
KIM: Acknowledged. 
[Street] 
TORRES: Help me! 
SECURITY: Let her go. 
(Neelix and Torres beam out. Chakotay runs) 
SECURITY: Stop! 
CHAKOTAY: Harry, I need an emergency transport now! 
[Bridge] 
KIM: Sorry, Commander, we're under attack. I had to raise shields. 
(Voyager leaves orbit with two ships in pursuit.)
[Sickbay] 
TORRES: No, leave me alone. 
NEELIX: We're friends. We're trying to help you. 
TORRES: No, don't touch me!
(Meanwhile, Tuvok is being brainwashed for the second time, and Janeway and Jaffen are kissing.) 
[Gantry] 
SECURITY: He turned into the access way. 
SECURITY 2: I'll call for reinforcements. 
(Chakotay encounters a forcefield protecting a very big drop.) 
SECURITY 2 [OC]: I think he went in there! 
SECURITY [OC]: Be careful, he might be armed.
