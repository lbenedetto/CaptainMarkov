Human Error
(The metronome helps the pianist keep time to Chopin's Nocturne no 1 in E minor, opus 72. She is revealed to be Annika Hansen, the grown woman with no Borg implants.)
[Mess hall] 
(A baby shower is in progress. Torres weighs a present in her hands.)
TORRES: Feels heavy. Baby's first tricorder? 
TUVOK: Not exactly. 
(Torres opens the box to reveal a pyramidical object decorated with er, pyramids.) 
TORRES: Thank you, I'm sure she'll love it. What is it? 
TUVOK: A pleenok. Vulcans use them to train their infants in primary logic. 
PARIS: Never too early to train those synapses, eh, Tuvok? Let me see that. I love a good puzzle. 
NEELIX: This one's from Mister Kim. 
TORRES: Starfleet diapers. 
(Disposable nappies with the Starfleet logo on them.)
KIM: Standard issue. 
PARIS: Well, we know who to call if there's a containment breach.
(Seven is fully human here, too.)
JANEWAY: Now that your Borg implants have been removed, you might think about having children of your own one day.
SEVEN: One day. I have been considering some less radical changes in my personal life. 
JANEWAY: Such as? 
SEVEN: I realise I don't have a rank, but I would like to request a uniform. 
JANEWAY: Consider it done. The Doctor tells me you don't need to regenerate any more. I can arrange some quarters for you, unless you enjoy curling up in the Cargo Bay. 
SEVEN: A bed would be more comfortable. Since I arrived on Voyager, your guidance has been invaluable. Thank you, Captain. 
JANEWAY: All I did was chart the course. You're the one who made the journey. 
CHAKOTAY: Seven, it's traditional for everyone to share their best wishes for the baby. I thought you might like to start. 
SEVEN: To the newest member of our crew. May all her desires be fulfilled except for one, so she'll always have something to strive for. 
JANEWAY: Very good.
ALL: Hear, hear. 
(Paris is struggling with the pleenok. He has it in pieces and cannot get it back together again.)
SEVEN: And may she inherit a sense of logic from her mother. 
KIM: I'll drink to that. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: That was strange. 
CHAKOTAY: Care to explain? 
PARIS: I wish I could. Long range sensors picked up an energy discharge, but now it's gone. There. There's another one. 
TUVOK: They're occurring approximately five point nine light years ahead. 
CHAKOTAY: Source? 
TUVOK: We're too far away to get a clear reading. 
JANEWAY: Bridge to Seven of Nine. 
[Mess hall] 
SEVEN: Go ahead. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Report to the Astrometrics lab. 
SEVEN: Acknowledged. Computer, end programme.
(Seven returns to her semi-Borg self, and puts her hair back up as she leaves.) 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: I wasn't able to find the cause of the discharges, but the region ahead contains unusual amounts of subspace radiation and metallic debris. 
TUVOK: Vessels? 
SEVEN: Not within range. But I'll have more data once we move closer. 
JANEWAY: I see no reason to alter course. Keep an eye on your sensors. 
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Now, on to more pressing matters. Does B'Elanna suspect anything? 
PARIS: Not a clue. 
JANEWAY: Good. Mess hall, fourteen hundred hours, be on time. I don't want to spoil the surprise. I expect both of you to show up. 
SEVEN: I'll be busy here. 
PARIS: What's wrong, Seven? No baby showers in the Collective? 
JANEWAY: I'm sure you can spare a few minutes. 
(Janeway and Paris leave.) 
TUVOK: If it's any consolation, I share your discomfort with social gatherings. 
SEVEN: They seem to occur with alarming frequency. 
TUVOK: Mister Neelix would argue that they improve morale. 
SEVEN: I have been looking for ways to improve my social skills. Perhaps I'll attend. 
[Holodeck - Seven's quarters] 
(Human Seven in her Starfleet uniform, standing in an empty room.)
NEELIX: Well, it certainly is efficient. No clutter, plenty of room to move around. But it's a little impersonal, don't you think? 
SEVEN: Explain. 
NEELIX: Well, these are your quarters, Seven. They should reflect your individuality. How about a table and a couple of chairs? Give yourself a place to work, entertain guests. Try to add a little colour. Photographs, artwork, knick-knacks. 
SEVEN: Knick-knacks? 
NEELIX: Little things, like the wood carvings in Ensign Kim's quarters. 
SEVEN: I've never been to Ensign Kim's quarters. But I suppose I could replicate some items and disperse them throughout the room. 
NEELIX: That's a start. Some people like to display pictures of family and friends. 
SEVEN: There's a photograph of my parents in the ship's database. I'll make a copy and place it in a frame. 
NEELIX: Good, good. 
SEVEN: A multispectral star chart might enhance this bulkhead. 
NEELIX: Or a painting. 
SEVEN: A painting of a star chart. 
NEELIX: I was thinking of something more abstract, more artistic. Drapes. Nothing livens up a room like good window dressing. Not to mention the added privacy. 
SEVEN: Privacy? We're in space. 
NEELIX: You never know when we'll be docking at a crowded space port. But we'll have to make sure that they match the carpet. I'm thinking of a Talaxian mosaic. Tulaberry blue stripes with an orange inlay. 
SEVEN: I appreciate your aesthetic insights, but I believe I can proceed on my own. 
(Doorbell)
SEVEN: Enter. 
(Chakotay is carrying a bag.)
CHAKOTAY: Am I interrupting? 
SEVEN: Please come in. 
CHAKOTAY: Love what you've done with the place. 
SEVEN: We're in the process of decorating. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe this will help. Consider it a housewarming gift. 
(Chakotay hands Seven a traditional netted loop of wood with dangling feathers.)
NEELIX: It's beautiful. What is it? 
SEVEN: A dream catcher. According to Native American mythology, it wards off nightmares. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm impressed. 
SEVEN: I've familiarised myself with your culture. 
CHAKOTAY: Now that you'll be sleeping instead of regenerating, I thought it might come in handy. 
SEVEN: I'm sure it will. Thank you. 
NEELIX: I'll let you two find a place to hang that, but it would look perfect right above the bed. Pleasant dreams. 
(Neelix leaves.) 
SEVEN: It was thoughtful of you to stop by. 
CHAKOTAY: On move in day? I wouldn't miss it. 
SEVEN: I suppose this makes you my inaugural guest. I'd be a negligent host if I didn't offer you a beverage. Tea? 
CHAKOTAY: That might be difficult. No replicator. 
SEVEN: Another flaw in the decor. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll requisition one for you first thing tomorrow. 
SEVEN: I'd appreciate that, Commander. 
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay. We're off duty. We can drop the formalities.
SEVEN: Yes, sir. 
CHAKOTAY: I enjoyed your toast today. You've come a long way. I hope to see more. 
SEVEN: You will. 
CHAKOTAY: Good night. 
SEVEN: Chakotay. As you might know I've taken an interest in culinary science. I'm preparing a meal tomorrow night, and I thought perhaps you could attend to evaluate my work. 
CHAKOTAY: I'd be happy to. 
SEVEN: Nineteen hundred hours? 
CHAKOTAY: I'll bring the wine and the furniture. 
SEVEN: Then you accept?
CHAKOTAY: It's a date. 
[Sickbay] 
EMH: (sings) Rock-a-bye baby, in the space dock. When the core blows, the shuttle will rock. When the hull breaks, the shuttle will fall. And down will come baby, shuttle and all. 
SEVEN: Are you trying to soothe the infant, or traumatise her? 
EMH: The lyrics are rather grim, but it's the melody they respond to. I recorded twenty nine in all, including a couple of Klingon lullabies. My favourite is 'quong vaj Ocht. Sleep, little warrior. I could tell by the look on their faces that my gift made quite an impression. 
SEVEN: No doubt. 
EMH: I wish you'd been there. It was a lovely shower. Tom and B'Elanna were disappointed that you didn't attend. 
SEVEN: I was occupied. 
EMH: Are you experiencing any shoulder pain? 
SEVEN: Yes. 
EMH: Hmm. Your biradial clamp is out of alignment by point three microns. I'm afraid it will have to be repaired. 
SEVEN: Can't you simply extract the component? 
EMH: Not if you want to keep using that arm. I know it's an inconvenience, but until we can find a way to remove your cybernetic systems, they'll have to be maintained. It's a minor procedure. We might as well take care of it now. 
SEVEN: I prefer to wait. 
EMH: We'll be done in an hour. 
SEVEN: I have research to complete. 
EMH: Oh. I suppose we can put it off until next week's physical. I also noticed that your electrolyte levels are down by twelve percent. Have you missed any regeneration cycles? 
SEVEN: Last night. 
EMH: Don't tell me. More research? This must be some project. Mind if I ask what you're working on? 
SEVEN: It's complicated. 
EMH: How do you mean? 
SEVEN: My personal life is none of your concern. 
EMH: I wasn't aware you had a personal life. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY: Report.
PARIS: It was an energy discharge, two hundred thousand kilometres starboard. 
TUVOK: It produced a level nine shockwave. 
CHAKOTAY: Some kind of weapon? 
TUVOK: Possibly. 
PARIS: Another one, five million kilometres to port. 
TUVOK: A shockwave is approaching. 
JANEWAY: Full power to the shields. 
(The shockwave hits them broadside on.)
KIM: Our warp field's destabilising. 
TUVOK: I'm detecting another. Distance, fifty thousand kilometres. 
JANEWAY: Turn our bow into the wavefront. It'll minimise the damage. 
PARIS: Sorry, Captain. There wasn't enough time. 
KIM: We've lost warp drive. 
TUVOK: I'm reading another. Distance, twenty six million kilometres. Too far to pose a threat. 
CHAKOTAY: If they are weapons, they don't seem to be directed at us. 
JANEWAY: Or whoever's firing them is a lousy shot. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: Astrometric sensors recorded the explosions. I believe it's a long range subspace warhead. The debris in this region suggests that dozens have been fired in the last several weeks. 
TUVOK: The warhead destroyed something. What was it? 
SEVEN: It appeared to be an unmanned probe. 
JANEWAY: This is all very intriguing, but I'd just as soon get out of here before we cross paths with another one of these things. Where do we stand on repairs? 
TUVOK: Subspace radiation from the explosions is making it difficult to create a stable warp field. Lieutenant Torres estimates forty eight hours. 
JANEWAY: Can you find a way to detect the warheads before they emerge from subspace? 
SEVEN: I believe so. The weapons create minor gravimetric distortions as they approach the subspace barrier. But I need to recalibrate my sensors to isolate the effect. 
JANEWAY: Do it. Even a few seconds' warning would help us. 
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. 
(Later, Icheb enters.)
SEVEN: Your duty shift doesn't begin for two hours. 
ICHEB: The Doctor sent me to relieve you early. He wants you to spend more time regenerating. 
SEVEN: I see he's enlisted an ally. 
ICHEB: Don't kill the messenger. Sophocles, Oedipus Rex. I've been studying Earth literature as a part of my Academy training. 
SEVEN: Continue these scans of the subspace barrier. Look for any gravimetric distortions. 
(Seven returns to Cargo Bay two and activates her alcove. Instead of stepping in, she leaves.) 
[Engineering] 
TORRES: Run another diagnostic on the injector ports. Make sure they're aligned. 
KIM: They're aligned, I checked. 
TORRES: Check again. Come to join the party? We're trying to cold start the warp core for the fifteenth time. 
SEVEN: Perhaps this will enhance your day. It's a belated gift for your baby shower. I apologise for my absence. 
TORRES: Oh. 
SEVEN: Proceed. 
(Torres opens the box to reveal a pair of baby booties.) 
SEVEN: They're lined with biothermal insulation. Your infant's feet will be protected even if the external temperature drops below minus forty degrees Celsius. 
TORRES: Well, they're certainly unique. Thank you. 
SEVEN: You're welcome. I wish to ask you a personal question. 
TORRES: Shoot. 
SEVEN: You have an appealing coiffure. What is your grooming regimen?
TORRES: You're asking me what I do with my hair? 
SEVEN: Yes. 
TORRES: Um, well, nothing too elaborate. Sonic shower, a little engine grease. Thinking about a new look? 
SEVEN: Perhaps. I'll keep you apprised, if you'd like. 
TORRES: Please do. 
(Seven leaves.) 
TORRES: Was that Seven of Nine? 
KIM: There must be an alien intruder on board. 
[Holodeck - Seven's quarters] 
SEVEN: Computer, make the following modifications to holodeck file Seven of Nine alpha three, personal quarters. 
COMPUTER: Modifications complete. 
SEVEN: Begin programme. 
(Human Seven is in a low-cut red dress, hair down. Piano music plays in the background, Chopin's Barcarolle.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You look perfect. Give me a hand with this? 
SEVEN: I'm surprised your Starfleet training didn't include cork extraction. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I must have been sick that day. (The cork refuses to budge from the bottle neck.)
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Looks like wine's off the menu. 
SEVEN: Unless you brought a phaser. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Never on the first date. 
SEVEN: Assist me. Slice these vegetables transversally in five millimetre increments. 
(Seven's pretend quarters include a kitchenette.)
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Aye, aye. 
(Seven carrots for two people?)
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: That smells delicious. 
SEVEN: Our appetizer is braised leeks. Primary course, rack of lamb with wild rice. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: No dessert? 
SEVEN: Dessert will be a surprise. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I can't wait. 
SEVEN: Does this contain enough sodium chloride for your taste? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Could use another point six milligrams. But you're the chef. 
(She sucks a sample off his little finger.)
SEVEN: I concur. More salt.
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Liszt? 
SEVEN: Chopin. I've discovered that classical music has intriguing mathematical properties. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Do you play an instrument? 
SEVEN: The Doctor's been giving me piano lessons. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I'd love to hear you play. 
SEVEN: I require more practice. 
(She looks at the way he is chopping the carrots.) 
SEVEN: Your technique is flawed. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Sorry. I'm a replicator man. 
SEVEN: Use your left hand to guide the food. Observe closely. Pay attention to the vegetable. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You're beautiful when you're chopping. I don't mean to sound like an old holonovel, but you've got a wonderful smile.
SEVEN: It wasn't a smile. It was a smirk. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Oh no, it was a smile. I could check the internal sensors if you'd like. 
SEVEN: Remain still. 
(She strokes his face.)
SEVEN: You have an intriguing facial structure. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I'll take that as a compliment. 
(They kiss, long and slow.)
SEVEN: I require more practice. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You're doing just fine. 
(Seven hears an electric zizzing sound.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: What's wrong? 
SEVEN: Nothing. 
[Seven's dream] 
(She's playing Chopin to the beat of a metronome, then kissing Chakotay.) 
EMH: I wasn't aware you had a personal life. 
(Seven sees her reflection in the mirror as her fully Borg self.) 
[Holodeck - Seven's quarters] 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay to Seven of Nine. 
(Seven wakes up next to Holo-Chakotay, on the couch. They are both fully clothed, though.)
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay to Seven, respond. 
SEVEN: Go ahead. 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Report to Astrometrics. We've found something. 
SEVEN: Yes, Commander. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Good morning. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
CHAKOTAY: Good morning.
SEVEN: You've found something? 
CHAKOTAY: At first, we thought it was another one of the probes. Then Icheb picked up an automated transmission. It's a warning beacon. 
VOICE [OC]: You have entered subspace munitions range four three four. Evacuate immediately. 
ICHEB: Apparently, this entire region is an alien testing ground. 
CHAKOTAY: We've been sending out emergency hails, but so far no response. Whoever's conducting these tests could be dozens of light years away. Any progress detecting their warheads? 
SEVEN: Not yet. 
CHAKOTAY: You seem a little distracted. 
SEVEN: I'm fine. 
CHAKOTAY: It's not like you to be late for a duty shift. Rough night? 
SEVEN: Not at all. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll be on the bridge if you find anything. 
(Chakotay leaves.) 
ICHEB: Better late than never. Titus Livius, A History of Rome. 
SEVEN: You're relieved. Get some rest. 
[Holodeck - Music room] 
(Seven is playing the piano to the beat of a metronome, as Chakotay watches.)
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Bravo. 
SEVEN: You approve? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Approve? I'm amazed. I was expecting Chopsticks. I had no idea you were so good. 
SEVEN: The Doctor's an efficient instructor. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: It won't be long before you're giving a recital for the entire crew. 
SEVEN: The Doctor did suggest that I accompany him during his next operatic performance. Your turn. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Unfortunately, I don't play. But I'd love to hear you again and this is one of my favourites. 
(He puts some sheet music on the stand. Seven starts the metronome and plays Schumann's Of Foreign Countries and Peoples. Chakotay stops the metronome.)
SEVEN: You want me to stop? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: No. I want you to play. 
SEVEN: I don't understand. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Look, your technique is flawless. But try to put a little more heart into the piece. More of yourself. 
(She starts again, but stops after a few bars.)
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: That's all right. Keep going. Tell me what you're feeling. 
SEVEN: My tempo is erratic. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Not what you're thinking, what you're feeling. Your emotions. 
SEVEN: Frustration, anxiety. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Stop thinking about the notes. Just play. 
SEVEN: I can't. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Yes, you can. Don't you see what's happening? The metronome is holding you back. It gives you a sense of order, but it also cuts you off from your feelings. Remember when you first came aboard? The thought of disconnecting from the hive mind terrified you. This is no different. It doesn't have to be perfect.
(Seven resumes playing the piece.) 
[Bridge] 
(More missiles are being tested on the subspace mines.)
TUVOK: Eight hundred thousand kilometres off the starboard bow. 
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Seven of Nine. 
SEVEN [OC]: Go ahead, Commander. 
CHAKOTAY: We need those sensor calibrations. 
[Holodeck - Music room] 
SEVEN: I'll need a moment to return to my station. 
[Bridge] 
CHAKOTAY: That would be a good idea. 
PARIS: Hull fracture, deck twelve. 
JANEWAY: Seven of Nine, report. 
SEVEN [OC]: Stand by, Captain. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: Lieutenant Paris, isolate subspace band omicron theta. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: Acknowledged. 
SEVEN [OC]: Direct your sensors to 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: Coordinates one seven eight mark two six. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: Nothing there. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: Correction, one seven eight mark three six. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: I can see them. Two warheads are about to emerge. Adjusting course. 
JANEWAY: Full power to the forward shields. 
PARIS: Impact in five, four, three, two. 
(The shockwave washes over Voyager as she meets it head on.)
PARIS: Shields are holding. 
JANEWAY: Why wasn't Seven at her post?
CHAKOTAY: Good question. Maybe you should ask her. 
[Ready room] 
JANEWAY: It was your responsibility to locate those warheads. 
SEVEN: I succeeded. 
JANEWAY: Not before we took heavy damage. You told Chakotay you'd have those sensor calibrations hours ago. 
SEVEN: The work took longer than I anticipated. 
JANEWAY: It might've gone faster if you'd stayed at your post, as you were ordered to do. 
SEVEN: I didn't realise I was confined to the Astrometrics lab. 
JANEWAY: You were on duty. This isn't the first time you've left your station over the past few days. Holodeck two? You've logged a lot of time in there. Mind if I ask why? Well, it must be something important, Seven. Forty nine hours in six days. 
SEVEN: I was running a simulation. 
JANEWAY: Of what? 
SEVEN: A new gravimetric array I've been developing. I wanted to perfect the design before I brought it to you. 
JANEWAY: I appreciate your efforts to improve our systems, but I can't have you dividing your time right now. When the ship's on alert I expect you to perform your duties. If you need to leave your post, inform Commander Chakotay. Understood? 
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. I apologise for my lapse in judgment. 
JANEWAY: We all make mistakes, Seven. I've even been known to make a few myself. It sounds intriguing, your new gravimetric array. When this crisis is over I'd be happy to take a look. Maybe I can lend a hand. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
ICHEB: I've analysed the sensor data from that last barrage. I've refined your detection method. We'll be able to see the weapons ten point three seconds earlier. 
SEVEN: The Captain will be pleased. 
ICHEB: Have I offended you? 
SEVEN: No. You've done nothing wrong. I was negligent in my duties. As a result, Voyager was nearly destroyed. I was hoping you could provide a quotation to help alleviate my guilt. 
ICHEB: I, I can't think of one, but I'd be happy to search the database. 
SEVEN: That won't be necessary. Stay here until I return. 
ICHEB: Where are you going? 
SEVEN: To correct an error. 
[Holodeck - Seven's quarters] 
SEVEN: Computer, activate Chakotay simulation. (Doorbell.)
SEVEN: Come in. 
(Chakotay enters with flowers and a plate under a cover.)
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I hope you're not allergic. Antarian moon blossoms, extremely rare. I had to smuggle them out of Airponics. Don't tell Neelix. I thought I'd cook for you tonight. How does roasted chicken sound? I slaved over the replicator for hours. Not hungry?
SEVEN: I called you here to thank you. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: For what? 
SEVEN: The past few days have been memorable. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: To say the least. You're ending this. 
SEVEN: In a manner of speaking, yes. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Why? 
SEVEN: Our relationship is interfering with my responsibilities on Voyager. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I could speak to the Captain, have her cut back on your duty shifts. Seven, the past few days have been more than memorable. They've been an important step forward for both of us. Don't throw that away. 
SEVEN: I'm sorry, Commander. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You're making a mistake. 
SEVEN: No, I'm trying to correct one. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Ask yourself why you want to end this. Is it out of a sense of duty, or something else? Every time you move closer to your emotions, you back away. Like hiding behind that metronome.
SEVEN: Your analogy is flawed. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Is it? I think you're afraid that embracing your humanity will make you weak, less than perfect. But think about what you stand to gain. 
SEVEN: It's irrelevant. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: No, it's not. Real intimacy with another person? Nothing's more relevant. 
(Seven hears the little noise again.)
SEVEN: I must return to my station. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Stay here with me. 
SEVEN: This ship needs me. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: So do I. 
(That sound again.)
SEVEN: I can't function this way. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You're not a drone anymore, you're human. 
SEVEN: Stop! 
(The noise becomes constant.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Seven, what's wrong? 
(Seven picks up her comm. badge and activates it.)
SEVEN: Sickbay, medical emergency. 
[Sickbay] 
EMH: Seven? Computer, locate Seven of Nine.
COMPUTER: Seven of Nine is in Holodeck two. 
[Holodeck - Seven's quarters] 
(The EMH appears.)
EMH: What happened? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: We were having an argument, then she just collapsed. 
EMH: Her cortical node is shutting down. She's going into neural shock. And what happened to her facial implants? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I thought you removed all her cybernetic systems. 
(The penny drops.)
EMH: Computer, end programme.
(Normality is resumed. Electricity plays over Seven's cortical implant.) 
[Sickbay] 
SEVEN: Commander? 
EMH: If you're looking for your other holographic friend, he's offline at the moment. Your cortical node began to shut down. Fortunately, I managed to stabilise it before there was any permanent damage. 
SEVEN: It was functioning properly when you examined me two days ago. 
EMH: I'm going to run a diagnostic on your entire cortical array, but it might help if I knew what you were doing before you collapsed. Did you suffer a physical injury of some kind? 
SEVEN: No. 
EMH: Were you exposed to any unusual radiation? 
SEVEN: No. 
EMH: What exactly were you doing in there? 
SEVEN: Research. 
EMH: That simulation of Commander Chakotay mentioned that the two of you were having an argument. Was that part of your research? I couldn't help but notice that you'd created some quarters for yourself. A new dress, dinner for two. 
SEVEN: I trust you'll respect doctor-patient confidentiality. 
EMH: Of course. 
SEVEN: I've been conducting simulations to explore different aspects of my humanity. 
EMH: Such as? 
SEVEN: Social activities, friendships with the crew, intimate relations. 
EMH: I take it our First Officer is your romantic interest.
SEVEN: Commander Chakotay seemed like an appropriate choice. He has many admirable qualities. 
EMH: So he does. What prompted all this? 
SEVEN: Unimatrix Zero. I've been trying to recreate some of the experiences I had there. Ever since it was destroyed, my life has seemed incomplete. I wanted to feel those emotions again. 
EMH: Well, this is encouraging. You might be ready to start forming deeper relationships. I'm proud of you, Seven. 
SEVEN: Your pride is misplaced. I intend to delete the programmes. 
EMH: Why? 
SEVEN: I can no longer perform my duties efficiently. My personal life has become a distraction. 
EMH: It's supposed to be a distraction. You simply have to find the right balance between work and recreation. 
SEVEN: Inform me when you finish the diagnostic. 
EMH: Seven. For what it's worth, you have excellent taste. Your quarters. They suited you. 
[Engineering] 
KIM: Antimatter flow stable, injector ports aligned. That should do it. 
TORRES: Torres to the bridge. Looks like we've got warp drive back. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY: Well done. Tom. 
PARIS: With pleasure. 
(Voyager goes to warp.)
PARIS: I'm detecting another subspace warhead. 
JANEWAY: Range? 
PARIS: Twelve million kilometres, closing from astern. 
CHAKOTAY: Red alert. Where's the target probe? 
PARIS: It's on a totally different trajectory. 
TUVOK: When we engaged the engines, the warhead must have diverted from its target and locked onto our warp signature. 
JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres. 
PARIS: It's matching our course. Eight million kilometres. 
JANEWAY: Can you get a weapon's lock? 
TUVOK: Affirmative. 
JANEWAY: Photon torpedoes, full spread. 
(Four wasted torpedoes.)
TUVOK: Our torpedoes have been neutralised. 
PARIS: Five million kilometres. 
JANEWAY: Bridge to Seven of Nine. 
SEVEN [OC]: Here, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Can you get me anything on 
[Astrometrics lab] 
JANEWAY [OC]: The warhead's internal circuitry? 
SEVEN: Stand by. I have it. 
JANEWAY [OC]: What can you tell me about the detonator? 
SEVEN: The weapon is armed with proximity resonance circuitry. 
JANEWAY [OC]: What's the activation frequency? 
SEVEN: Four point eight four gigahertz. 
[Bridge] 
TUVOK: I may be able to disarm it with an anti-resonance pulse. 
JANEWAY: Do it. 
PARIS: Two million kilometres. 
TUVOK: Initiating the pulse. 
JANEWAY: Seven, status? 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: The warhead's rotating its activation frequency. It's still armed. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: One million kilometres. 
CHAKOTAY: Can you compensate? 
TUVOK: Negative. 
SEVEN [OC]: Captain, I believe I can disarm

SEVEN: The warhead. 
JANEWAY [OC]: How? 
SEVEN: By extracting the detonator with our transporter. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY: At this velocity? The device is too small. You'd never get a lock. 
SEVEN [OC]: I can use the sub 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: Micron imager to focus our targeting scanners. Please give me transporter control. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: Eight hundred thousand. 
(Janeway nods to Tuvok.)
JANEWAY: All right, Seven, it's up you. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: I have a lock. Energising. The detonator's protected by tritanium shielding. I can penetrate it, but not at this distance. We'll have to wait until it's closer. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: Five hundred thousand. 
JANEWAY: Status. 
SEVEN [OC]: Not yet, Captain. 
PARIS: Four 
[Astrometrics lab] 
PARIS [OC]: Three, two. Brace for impact! 
(The missile falls apart on the hull.) 
[Cargo Bay two] 
SEVEN: Doctor. You've come to deliver unpleasant news. 
EMH: Is it that obvious? I've completed my diagnostic. What you experienced was no malfunction. Your cortical node was designed to shut down your higher brain functions when you achieve a certain level of emotional stimulation. 
SEVEN: Clarify. 
EMH: It appears to be a fail-safe mechanism to deactivate drones who start to regain their emotions. Knowing the Borg, it makes perfect sense. Finding one's heart is the surest road to individuality. 
SEVEN: I'm no longer linked to the hive mind. 
EMH: The technology's built into your node. It simply remained dormant, until now. 
SEVEN: Can you repair me? 
EMH: Possibly. I've been thinking about a way to reconfigure the micro-circuitry. I won't lie to you, Seven. It would entail multiple surgeries, and the recovery might be difficult. But I believe we could eventually succeed. I'll prepare the surgical bay. We can begin tomorrow morning. 
SEVEN: No. 
EMH: Without the procedure, you won't be able to continue your simulations. 
SEVEN: I've experienced enough humanity for the time being. They were only holographic fantasies, Doctor. An inefficient use of my time. 
EMH: You don't really believe that. 
SEVEN: The fail-safe device will insure that I'm no longer distracted.
EMH: That's the Borg talking, not you. As your physician. As your friend, I'm asking you to let me proceed. 
SEVEN: I need to regenerate.
EMH: Seven. 
SEVEN: Goodnight, Doctor. 
[Corridor] 
CHAKOTAY: Where's the fire? 
SEVEN: Fire? 
CHAKOTAY: You seem to be in a hurry. 
SEVEN: I have to finish my report on the subspace warheads. 
CHAKOTAY: The ship's out of danger, thanks to you. You've earned a break. Why don't you join me in the mess hall. Neelix is going to give a cooking lesson. Talaxian tenderloin in ten minutes.
SEVEN: I'm no longer interested in cooking. 
CHAKOTAY: Then come for the company. B'Elanna's going to be there, Tuvok even promised to show up. It'll be fun. 
SEVEN: I appreciate your offer. Another time perhaps. 
CHAKOTAY: You know, you should try socialising with the crew a little more. It might do you some good.
