Memorial
[Delta Flyer] 
KIM: Who left their dirty plate in the replicator? Tom? 
PARIS: It wasn't me. 
KIM: It's a biohazard. 
PARIS: Take it easy. We'll decontaminate you when we get back home. 
KIM: If I ever volunteer for a two week away mission again, would somebody please confine me to Sickbay? 
CHAKOTAY: Too much togetherness for you, Harry? 
KIM: Nothing personal, Commander. 
NEELIX: To tell you the truth, I've enjoyed our little junket together. It's given the four of us a chance to bond.
KIM: The bonding stopped when the sonic shower went offline. 
NEELIX: That's all part of the experience, the adventure. Think of the great explorers that came before us. They survived without creature comforts. 
KIM: I wouldn't want to bunk with them, either. 
PARIS: Now there's a sight for sore eyes. 
(Voyager is ahead.)
CHAKOTAY: Delta Flyer to Voyager. We're on our approach. 
JANEWAY [OC]: We've kept a candle burning in the window for you.
PARIS: Forget the candles, break out the champagne. 
JANEWAY [OC]: I take it the mission was a success? 
PARIS: Fifteen planets scanned in fourteen days. We've got a cargo hold overflowing with dilithium ore. 
JANEWAY [OC]: That's the kind of news I like to hear. 
[Corridor] 
EMH: The explorers return. 
(Paris gets a kiss from Torres.)
TORRES: Welcome home. 
PARIS: I should go away more often. 
KIM: I'm not going away for a long, long time. 
TORRES: Homesick, Harry?
KIM: Let's just say I'm looking forward to a hot shower and a comfortable bed. 
EMH: Don't forget to stop by Sickbay for your check-up. 
PARIS: Check-up? For what? 
EMH: Away team protocol. Crew members are required to submit to a physical if the mission lasts more than two weeks. Now, who's first? 
CHAKOTAY: I'll let you know in the morning, Doctor. 
(They all head off down different corridors.)
EMH: Why put off till tomorrow what you can do today? Commander? Mister Paris? 
(Further on.)
TORRES: I've been working on a little surprise for you. 
PARIS: Oh? Naughty, or nice? 
TORRES: Close your eyes. 
PARIS: I like it already. 
[Paris' quarters] 
TORRES: Come on. So what do you think? 
PARIS: Oh! A television set. 
TORRES: Circa 1956. I replicated the components, but I assembled it myself. This is the remote control. You select what you want to watch by pressing this button. 
(A simple remote with just four buttons.)
PARIS: A slight problem. There were no remote controls in the 1950's. 
TORRES: I took a little poetic license. 
PARIS: Cartoon! 
TORRES: I found them in the ship's database. 
(He changes channels.)
TV: Vacuum Action! Mop, mop, don't stop
PARIS: What's that? 
TORRES: That is called a jingle. According to the research I did, they inserted them into the entertainment programs. I know, it's confusing, but I kept them in for authenticity. I even replicated popcorn. 
PARIS: Everything is perfect except for one tiny detail. 
TORRES: What? 
PARIS: You forgot the beer. 
TORRES: I can fix that. 
(Paris switches back to the old cartoon, Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur.)
TORRES: You didn't miss much while you were away. The Doctor gave a lecture on insects indigenous to the Delta Quadrant. 
PARIS: Ah ha. 
TORRES: It was pretty boring, until Ensign Farley started snoring and then no one could keep a straight face. Of course, the Doctor wasn't at all amused. 
PARIS: Ooo! Hockey!
TORRES: It was a shame that we had to cut the lecture short, but the warp core overloaded and then the Borg invaded and we were all assimilated. 
PARIS: Mmm hmm. 
TORRES: You haven't heard a single thing I've said, have you? 
PARIS: Oh! Look at that!
TORRES: Maybe this was a bad idea. 
(Later, Paris is on to The Untouchables. Torres has fallen asleep on the couch.)
TV: This is Eliot Ness. Come out, we don't want any trouble! 
(During a gun fight, the picture changes to a different set of people under fire.) 
TV: We're under attack. Stay down. Keep moving. Somebody cover me. 
(Paris tries changing channels, but the show remains the same. He goes for the final resort, manual controls, before hitting the set. Then he sees that one of the combatants is himself.)
TV: We need a medic over here. Stay down. Move it. Stay low. 
[Battlefield] 
SOLDIER [OC]: I said hold your fire! 
SOLDIER 2 [OC]: I need a medic. 
(Paris checks on some nearby bodies.)
SOLDIER [OC]: Keep moving. 
(Paris gets shot in the upper left arm.)
TORRES [OC]: Tom? 
[Paris' quarters] 
(Paris is lying on the floor.)
TORRES: Tom? Tom. (he wakes) It must have been one hell of a dream. 
(The Untouchables is back on the television set.)
PARIS: I was, I was in the middle of a battlefield. I was grazed right, right here. They always said television was a bad influence. 
TORRES: How about a nice cartoon? That should chase away the nightmare.
PARIS: No! No, I think I've had enough. 
(In a Jefferies tube, Kim hears sounds of battle. The hatch recedes from him, and he feels dizzy. He drops the instrument he is holding and crawls on his elbows towards the hatch. Panting, he opens it and gets out into a larger junction.) 
[Sickbay] 
EMH: It sounds like you had an anxiety attack. 
KIM: I've never been claustrophobic before. 
EMH: There's a first time for everything. 
KIM: Do you know what could have caused it? 
EMH: Let's see. You spend two weeks on an away mission, working eighteen hour days, then as soon as you return to Voyager you become Ensign Eager, back on duty and raring to go. 
KIM: I had work to do. There was a plasma leak on deck five. 
EMH: Plasma leak or no plasma leak, you're suffering from exhaustion. I'm recommending you take the next two days off. 
KIM: But I 
EMH: I can always make it three. 
KIM: You win. I guess I am pretty tired. 
[Mess hall] 
(A kettle whistles, and Neelix nearly jumps out of his skin whilst holding a large knife. Then he sees what it is and takes it off the stove.)
NAOMI: Welcome back. 
NEELIX: Oh, hello. 
NAOMI: Did you have a good trip? 
NEELIX: Wonderful, thank you.
NAOMI: You look tired.
NEELIX: Do I? Just a little shuttle lag. Don't you have a geometry lesson? You don't want to keep your teacher waiting.
NAOMI: Seven of Nine assigned me a special project. I'm supposed to build a tetragon but I have to use everyday things. I'm not allowed to use a replicator. I was thinking about using some vegetables from the airponics bay. Carrots and celery? Neelix? 
NEELIX: Carrots and celery. A good idea. 
NAOMI: Will you help me? 
NEELIX: I don't think I'll have time today. 
NAOMI: Tonight? 
NEELIX: I don't think that I'll have time then either. Lot of work to do. 
NAOMI: Then why don't I help you? What's cooking? (she touches a hot pan lid) Ouch!
NEELIX: Let me see your hand! 
NAOMI: I'm okay. 
NEELIX: Your hand! We've got to get you to Sickbay. 
NAOMI: I'm fine. 
NEELIX: Sickbay! 
(Some crew enter the mess hall, laughing.)
NEELIX: Get down. Stay behind me. 
NAOMI: What? 
NEELIX: I said get down! 
[Forest] 
(The battle continues amongst the trees at night.)
SOLDER [OC]: I'm hit! 
SOLDIER 2 [OC]: Someone help me with this, please 
SOLDIER 3 [OC]: Keep moving. Move out to the left contingent. 
CHAKOTAY: Try not to move. 
DYING COLONIST: Get away from me. 
CHAKOTAY: I can help you. 
DYING COLONIST: I don't want your help. 
CHAKOTAY: Hold your fire. I said, hold your fire! 
SOLDIER ONE: We're under attack, sir. 
CHAKOTAY: Saavdra, where is he? 
YOUNG SOLDIER: I think he's at base. 
SOLDIER [OC]: Let's move out. 
CHAKOTAY: We were supposed to evacuate the colony, not destroy it!
SAAVDRA: That was before the Nakan started shooting. 
CHAKOTAY: They're civilians! 
SAAVDRA: Civilians with particle weapons. 
TUVOK [OC]: Tuvok to Commander Chakotay. 
[Chakotay's quarters] 
TUVOK [OC]: Commander, please respond. 
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. 
TUVOK [OC]: We have a security breach in the mess hall. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm on my way. 
[Mess hall] 
NEELIX: Tell them to call off the attack. 
TUVOK: Put down your weapon, Neelix. Let us help you. 
NEELIX: Stay away! I won't let you hurt her! Get back! 
(Neelix shoots at a security guard trying to enter through one door. Chakotay enters through the other and ducks down.)
TUVOK: He appears to be hallucinating. 
CHAKOTAY: Neelix, this is Commander Chakotay. Let Naomi go. No one's going to hurt her. That's an order. 
NEELIX: No! Not until Saavdra's called off his attack. 
TUVOK: There's a back entrance to the galley. If you can distract him, perhaps I
CHAKOTAY: I want to try something first. Neelix, listen to me. It's okay, Saavdra ordered a cease-fire. The colony's secure. The battle is over. 
NEELIX: Why do I still hear weapons fire? 
CHAKOTAY: It's just a few soldiers. They're celebrating. The battle's over. 
NAOMI: Neelix, please. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll protect Naomi. 
NEELIX: How do I know you won't trick me? 
CHAKOTAY: Because I'm on your side. I want to end this conflict as much as you do. Let her go. It's safe now. The killing's over.
(Neelix lets Naomi run to Chakotay, then hands him his phaser. Neelix clings to Chakotay as he takes him away.) 
[Sickbay] 
EMH: I gave him a mild sedative. 
JANEWAY: Any idea what caused the delusions? 
EMH: His norepinephrine levels are three times what they should be. Neurochemically speaking, he's suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress syndrome. 
CHAKOTAY: I dreamed I was fighting in an alien war. The same war Neelix seemed to be reliving. 
EMH: Harry Kim was in earlier. He had an anxiety attack. I haven't spoken with Mister Paris yet. 
JANEWAY: Three members of the same away team. Did you run into any kind of trouble while you were gone? 
CHAKOTAY: None. The mission was by the book. 
EMH: Your engramatic activities contradict that, Commander. These are real memories, not mere dreams or hallucinations. 
JANEWAY: Maybe you were abducted, manipulated into fighting. Our memories have been tampered with before. We're going to retrace your mission. Start reviewing the Delta Flyer's sensor logs. See if you come up with anything unusual. How long before Neelix is back on his feet? 
EMH: I can wake him now, if you'd like. 
JANEWAY: Do it. Each of you seems to hold a piece of the puzzle. Let's see if we can start putting them together. 
[Briefing room] 
PARIS: I don't remember much, just bits and pieces. I dreamt I was on a planet in the middle of a battle. I have no idea how I got there. I can't remember. 
KIM: When I was in the Jefferies tube I heard weapons fire, screams. People were screaming. I got so frightened. 
JANEWAY: Of what? 
KIM: I, I don't know. 
PARIS: I remember getting shot. 
EMH: There's no evidence of a wound. 
CHAKOTAY: If our memories were wiped, our physical injuries could have been masked as well. 
JANEWAY: Do any of you recall who you were fighting? 
NEELIX: It was dark. I couldn't see them very well.
PARIS: They were firing at us.
NEELIX: The Nakaa. The Nakana. 
KIM: The Nakan. They were called the Nakan. 
PARIS: Right. Right. They, they lived in a remote colony. We were trying to evacuate them. 
NEELIX: But they were fighting us. 
KIM: Why couldn't they just do what they were told? 
NEELIX: We had no right to be there! 
KIM: It was for their own good. 
JANEWAY: Gentlemen, stay focused. You said you were trying to evacuate their colony. Why? 
PARIS: Those were our orders. 
EMH: Who gave them? 
CHAKOTAY: Saavdra. 
PARIS: Commander Saavdra. 
KIM: He was in charge of our unit. We were part of an attack force. 
JANEWAY: You were coerced. 
PARIS: No. No, I volunteered. We all did.
EMH: I find that difficult to believe. You were obviously manipulated somehow. 
NEELIX: No. No, no, no, no, I remember now. We held a briefing to plan the evacuation. You were there, Commander. Mister Paris. 
PARIS: It was a command post. 
KIM: That's right. It was night, oh two hundred hours. 
CHAKOTAY: We'd been awake for days. We were exhausted. 
[Command post] 
SAAVDRA: What do our spotters report? 
KIM: The Nakan are unarmed. They won't put up a fight. 
SAAVDRA: Once we've disabled their shield generators, we'll deploy units five and six. They may be unarmed, but they won't be happy to see us. Don't provoke them. I want to come out of this with zero casualties on both sides. 
SOLDIER ONE: Understood. 
PARIS: The perimeter's the weakest in sector fourteen. The terrain's very flat. 
NEELIX: It's an ideal landing spot for transports. 
SAAVDRA: Once we've secured the village, take the colonists there. Get them aboard. Do your best to reassure them. Make them understand that this is a temporary relocation. That they're going to be back there in a few weeks. Understood? 
NEELIX: Aye, aye, sir. 
SAAVDRA: Problem? 
CHAKOTAY: Just one. This unit could use a little sleep. I suggest we wait until daybreak. 
SAAVDRA: I promised Command we'd have this colony secured today. 
CHAKOTAY: It can wait a few hours. 
SAAVDRA: I'm sorry. But when this mission's over, how does a week on Toranius Prime sound? 
CHAKOTAY: Never been there. 
SAAVDRA: Compared to this place, it's paradise. 
[Briefing room] 
CHAKOTAY: The mission proceeded as planned. We disabled their shield generators and entered the colony. 
KIM: We were rounding up the Nakan. To be honest, I expected them to give us a little more trouble. 
NEELIX: But then we came to the last enclosure. Do you remember the last enclosure? It was empty. Where were they? They were supposed to be there. 
PARIS: Twenty four colonists unaccounted for. We thought the spotters had made a mistake. We should have known something was wrong. We should have gotten out then. 
[Enclosure] 
(Colonist are being walked out.)
YOUNG SOLDIER: This way. Stay in line. Keep moving. 
CHAKOTAY: Evacuation detail to base. We're ready for transport. 
SAAVDRA [OC]: Transport's on approach. 
FEMALE COLONIST: I have to find my husband. 
PARIS: Don't worry. He'll be on one of the transports. 
FEMALE COLONIST: Which one? 
PARIS: I don't know, but we'll find him. 
(Weapons fire.)
CHAKOTAY: Everybody down! Base, we're under attack. Repeat. We're under attack! 
[Briefing room] 
PARIS: Those missing colonists, they were armed. They fired the first shots. It wasn't our fault! 
CHAKOTAY: We can't be sure of that. It could have been one of our own people. Fatigue. A phaser malfunction. You just don't know! 
NEELIX: Either way, it doesn't justify what we did. 
JANEWAY: What did you do? What happened down there? 
[Enclosure] 
CHAKOTAY: Keep moving. Stay together. Hold your fire! 
NEELIX: Stay down! 
(The colonists panic and run.)
CHAKOTAY: Stay together. 
KIM: Stop running. Stop! 
NEELIX: Get down! Get down, get down, get down! Stop running! Stop running!
(The colonists get shot in the back.) 
[Briefing room] 
KIM: We didn't have any other choice.
CHAKOTAY: Like hell we didn't. 
KIM: They were wiping us out! 
CHAKOTAY: That didn't give us the right to murder civilians. 
NEELIX: I tried to protect the children, but I couldn't stop them from running away. 
KIM: I ran too. Sounds of phaser fire. People shouting. I had to get out of there. 
[Cavern] 
(Kim crawls through a narrow tunnel in to the cavern. There is a kettle on a stove, and some food on a plate. He hears a noise and knocks over a wall of barrels to reveal two people, a woman and her elderly father.)
WOMAN: Please, don't hurt us. 
KIM: Move where I can see you! Move! 
WOMAN: Please, please, he's no threat to you. 
KIM: Tell me how I can get out of these tunnels and I'll leave you alone. Tell me! 
WOMAN: Go back the way you came. At the second fork take the tunnel to your left. Follow it to the end. It will lead you to the river. 
(The old man moves forward. Kim opens fire.) 
[Briefing room] 
KIM: He was going to kill me. 
PARIS: Easy, Harry. 
KIM: They wouldn't listen! Why? Why wouldn't they listen? 
CHAKOTAY: We killed eighty two civilians that night. No one was left alive. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We've entered the system where the away team conducted its recent survey, hoping to find an explanation for their memories of the Nakan massacre. 
[Paris' quarters] 
(Doorbell. Paris is lying on the sofa.)
PARIS: Yeah. Yeah! 
TORRES: Missed you at breakfast. 
PARIS: I wasn't hungry. 
TORRES: Sleep a little? 
PARIS: Five, six minutes. 
TORRES: I found another episode of The Untouchables. Elliot Ness captures somebody named Al Caypone. 
PARIS: Capone. Maybe later. 
TORRES: Well, you've got to eat something. Pizza? 
PARIS: Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'd rather just be alone. 
TORRES: Tom. 
PARIS: No. I don't want to be comforted right now. 
TORRES: I know the last few days have been difficult. 
PARIS: Difficult. Difficult doesn't quite cover it. I helped murder eighty two innocent people. 
TORRES: You don't know that. 
PARIS: I know what I remember. 
TORRES: The Doctor says your memories could have been altered. 
PARIS: I was there! When I close my eyes, I can see the bodies. I, I can hear the weapons fire. I can feel where I was shot. 
TORRES: Then why isn't there evidence of a wound?
PARIS: I don't know! 
TORRES: All I'm asking is that you consider the possibility that this didn't happen. We'll keep investigating. There are sensor readings on the Delta Flyer that we haven't even analysed yet. 
PARIS: I can't concentrate on sensor readings right now. 
TORRES: Try. 
PARIS: I can't! Stop pushing me! I don't want your help! 
(Torres turns to leave.)
PARIS: I'm sorry. 
TORRES: You know where to find me. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: This was your first stop on the away mission. A class M planet with one natural satellite. 
JANEWAY: Did you send anyone to the surface? 
CHAKOTAY: No, we only scanned for dilithium deposits. We were in orbit for less than an hour. 
JANEWAY: Next. 
SEVEN: You came into contact with this vessel en route to your second destination. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain Bathar of Hodos. 
JANEWAY: Photogenic. 
CHAKOTAY: He's a merchant. Claimed to have a formula that stops the aging process. 
JANEWAY: Oh, you didn't happen to buy any, did you? 
CHAKOTAY: It was only a tripolymer enzyme. It makes a great shoe polish though. 
JANEWAY: Moving on. 
SEVEN: Your second stop. 
(Images of the massacre.)
JANEWAY: Tarakis. The planet, it's called Tarakis. I've been here.
(Now Janeway is one of the soldiers.) 
[Enclosure] 
(Bodies are being vaporised.)
JANEWAY: What the hell are you doing? 
SAAVDRA: Stand aside. 
JANEWAY: They're already dead. 
SAAVDRA: They were never here. We disabled their shield generators, entered the colony and they were gone. 
JANEWAY: No one's going to believe that. 
SAAVDRA: They will if we all keep to the same story. 
JANEWAY: I won't lie about what happened here. 
SAAVDRA: Then you say nothing. 
JANEWAY: We murdered these people!
SAAVDRA: In self defence. 
JANEWAY: If that were true, you wouldn't be vapourising the evidence. You don't have to listen to him! We've got to let people know we panicked. They'll understand! 
SAAVDRA: No, they won't. Move away. I said, move away! 
[Mess hall] 
(Janeway wakes with a cry.)
JANEWAY: Oh! How long have I been here? 
EMH: Three hours. You started hallucinating in Astrometrics. I'm afraid I had to sedate you. 
JANEWAY: I was there. I was at the colony with Saavdra. 
EMH: You're not the only one. Thirty nine crew members have begun to experience the same memories. 
TUVOK: It appears that the entire crew has been affected. 
(And the mess hall is an overflow ward.)
EMH: Their symptoms are identical. Increased engramatic activity, nightmares. 
JANEWAY: I can imagine the away team being pulled into an alien conflict, but these people weren't anywhere near this system. 
TUVOK: We've analysed Voyager's sensor records. If we did participate in a war, all evidence of it has been erased. 
JANEWAY: The dream was so vivid. As real as anything I've experienced. But I refuse to believe that we could 
EMH: Real or not, the memories are having a deleterious effect on the crew. The syndrome began to spread once we entered this system. I suggest we reverse course before it gets worse. 
JANEWAY: No. If this massacre really happened, someone is to blame. I want to be certain that it wasn't us. 
TUVOK: With all due respect, your judgment may be clouded by feelings of guilt about an incident that never occurred. The danger to our crew here and now is indisputable. 
JANEWAY: I've seen you looking better, Ensign. 
ENSIGN: Yes, ma'am. 
JANEWAY: I've felt better myself. But were going to get through this. The massacre took place on Tarakis. Go to Red alert and set a course.
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. 
EMH: A neural suppressant. It will help keep the memories from resurfacing. 
(Seven brings food to Neelix.)
SEVEN: Your favourites. Talaxian stew and terra nut soufflé. The soufflé has collapsed slightly, but its nutritional content is intact.
NEELIX: Thank you. It looks delicious.
SEVEN: When Naomi Wildman is sad, she consumes desserts. She claims it improves her emotional state. Perhaps you should try it. 
NEELIX: Naomi must be terrified of me, after what happened in the galley. 
SEVEN: She's concerned about you. She told me she wants to visit you. 
NEELIX: No. Not like this. I might do something to scare her again. 
SEVEN: I'll give her your regards.
NEELIX: Seven? When you were a Borg, you were involved in some unpleasant activities. 
SEVEN: I helped to assimilate millions. 
NEELIX: I don't mean to be insensitive, but do you ever feel shame about what you did? 
SEVEN: Frequently. 
NEELIX: How to you manage to keep going, knowing that you've done such horrible things? 
SEVEN: I have no choice. 
NEELIX: Guilt is irrelevant? 
SEVEN: On the contrary. My feelings of remorse help me remember what I did, and prevent me from taking similar actions in the future. Guilt can be a difficult, but useful, emotion.
NEELIX: It's certainly difficult. Is that chocolate mixed in there with the terra nuts? 
SEVEN: I altered the recipe slightly. I hope you don't object. 
NEELIX: Not at all. 
[Bridge] 
PARIS: Tarakis, dead ahead. 
JANEWAY: Shields. Stand by weapons. On screen. Scan for vessels. 
TUVOK: There are none. 
JANEWAY: Take us into orbit. 
PARIS: Ma'am? 
JANEWAY: Do it, Mister Paris. 
(He does.)
CHAKOTAY: Life signs? 
TUVOK: The planet appears to be uninhabited. 
KIM: Looks the same as it did a few days ago when we scanned for dilithium deposits. 
CHAKOTAY: Signs of weapons fire or phaser residue? 
TUVOK: Negative. 
JANEWAY: Run a full spectral scan. Look for anything unusual. 
TUVOK: Nothing on geometric sensors. 
KIM: Hold on. I'm picking up a power signature. 
CHAKOTAY: Source? 
KIM: I can't tell. The signal's erratic, but it's coming from the northernmost continent. Coordinates one seven two mark five. 
[Transporter room] 
(The away team is ready for anything.)
JANEWAY: Phasers. 
[Tarakis - open meadow] 
CHAKOTAY: Call it an educated guess, but I don't think this looks like a war zone. 
JANEWAY: There's something familiar about it, though. I recognise those mountains. 
KIM: Those trees weren't here. 
JANEWAY: Search the area. 
(They split up into two groups. A bird call makes Chakotay jump.)
TUVOK: Ensign? 
KIM: The tunnel. It's nearby. The one where I, er 
PARIS: How'd you get into it? 
KIM: There was a rock formation. It hid the opening.
JANEWAY: A faint energy signature. This way.
KIM: Over here. 
PARIS: There's your physical evidence. 
TUVOK: I suggest we proceed with caution. Stand guard. 
(Tuvok leaves Paris with a security guard. Janeway and Chakotay continue to track the energy source.) 
[Tunnel] 
KIM: I, I, I can't! 
TUVOK: Remain calm. Slow, deep breaths. 
[Cavern] 
(Everything is covered in cobwebs.)
KIM: They were over there. 
(Tuvok's wrist torch illuminates a pair of skeletons.)
TUVOK: I've found the remains of two humanoids, but you were not responsible for their deaths. They died over three hundred years ago. 
[Memorial field] 
(The energy source is a massive marble monument with a pulsing yellow ball on top. The base is inscribed with hieroglyphs.)
JANEWAY: I think we've found our war. 
[Astrometrics lab] 
SEVEN: The structure contains a synaptic transmitter. I believe it was designed to send neurogenic pulses throughout this system. 
JANEWAY: So anyone passing through would experience the Nakan massacre, like we did. 
SEVEN: Precisely. 
CHAKOTAY: Try running those symbols inscribed on the base through the translation matrix. (reads) Words alone cannot convey the suffering. Words alone cannot prevent what happened here from happening again. Beyond words lies experience. Beyond experience lies truth. Make this truth your own. 
JANEWAY: It's a memorial. We weren't victims of a conspiracy, we were witnesses to a massacre. 
CHAKOTAY: More than witnesses. By being forced to relive those events, half the crew's been traumatised. 
JANEWAY: Maybe that was the point. I certainly won't forget what happened here. 
CHAKOTAY: Anything in that database that might tell us who built this thing? 
SEVEN: No. The technology has been neglected for more than two centuries. Its power cells are deteriorating. 
JANEWAY: That could explain why our memories were so fragmented. It was probably designed to transmit the experience in sequence. 
CHAKOTAY: Fascinating. Now let's try to shut it down so nobody else has to go through this. Kathryn? 
JANEWAY: Yes, of course. 
[Briefing room] 
EMH: Even if we do shut down the transmitter, I'm afraid your memories of the massacre are permanent. 
TUVOK: But we'll prevent this from happening to other passing ships. 
NEELIX: If we do that, all record of what happened here would be lost. 
CHAKOTAY: The monument will still be here. 
NEELIX: But that doesn't really tell the story. Someone put a lot of time and care into building that transmitter. We can't just deactivate it. We don't have the right. 
KIM: Did they have the right to force us to relive all that?
NEELIX: They wanted others to know what it was like, in the hopes that nothing like it would happen again. 
CHAKOTAY: Why should anyone have to experience an atrocity they didn't commit? 
NEELIX: Because that's how you learn not to make the same mistake. If we destroy the evidence, we're no better than Saavdra. 
PARIS: Maybe he had a point. 
KIM: It wasn't our fault! 
TUVOK: Given the danger involved, it's only logical 
NEELIX: This isn't about logic. It's about remembering. 
CHAKOTAY: Some things are best forgotten. 
JANEWAY: Not this. I stood by once before and did nothing. Not again. 
EMH: Captain? 
JANEWAY: I watched while Saavdra vaporised the bodies. 
PARIS: No offence but, those were other peoples' memories. 
JANEWAY: The obelisk at Khitomer. The fields of Gettysburg. Those are other peoples' memories too, but we don't honour them any less. The eighty two colonists who died here, they deserve their memorial. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain. 
JANEWAY: We're not going to shut down the transmitter. Is that clear? Is that clear?
TUVOK: Are you suggesting we leave it intact? 
JANEWAY: I'm suggesting that we repair it. Recharge the power cells. I want that monument to function properly for another three hundred years. We'll place a warning buoy in orbit. Anyone who enters this system will know what to expect. Dismissed. 
[Memorial field] 
(The original away team place power transfer receivers on the monument base.)
CHAKOTAY: We're ready, Captain. 
JANEWAY: I know this was hardest on the four of you. But if you hadn't stopped at this planet all the people who died here would have been forgotten. And if they could, I know they'd thank you. Janeway to Voyager. Stand by to initiate power transfer. Five to beam up.
