The Killing Game
[Holodeck two - Klingon battle simulation] 
(Janeway, as a Klingon warrior, is fighting other warriors.)
JANEWAY: P'tahk! Prepare to meet your ancestors! 
(But the other warriors keep pushing her back until one manages to thrust the point of his bat'leth into her chest, knocking her down on her back.)
JANEWAY: This battle is yours today, but the House of Mo'kai will never yield. 
(She grabs a mace from a fallen Klingon and resumes the fight. She is interrupted by an Hirogen in Klingon armour.)
KARR: Doh-cha scree! Move away, coward. I want to make this kill. 
JANEWAY: You should have killed me when my back was turned. 
KARR: I want to see the fear in your eyes. 
JANEWAY: Look closely and you'll see your own destruction. 
KARR: You are resilient prey. 
JANEWAY: I'm no one's prey. 
(She raises the mace and he stabs her in the stomach.) 
KARR: You are mine, now and after death. Sickbay, this is Holodeck two. Janeway requires medical assistance. 
[Sickbay] 
(Voyager is surrounded by Hirogen vessels. Janeway now looks human on the biobed. An Hirogen is working in Sickbay.)
MEDIC: She'll survive. 
KARR: What about her neural interface? 
(The medic scans a Y shaped scar below Janeway's jawline.)
MEDIC: Stable. 
KARR: Are you sure? There were times when she seemed aware of who she is. 
MEDIC: Impossible. I was monitoring the crew during the entire simulation. She believes she's whoever we programme her to be. Shall I return her to the Klingon simulation? 
KARR: No. Bring her to Holodeck one. I've found another programme I want to try. A conflict that took place on her own planet. It should prove stimulating. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
(A French caf� during World War 2. Mademoiselle de Neuf is singing It Can't Be Wrong to piano accompaniment.)
SEVEN: Wrong, would it be wrong to kiss? Seeing I feel like this, would it be wrong to try? Wrong, would it be wrong to stay, here in your arms this way, under this starry sky? If it is wrong (Tuvok is the bartender in a white jacket, and the owner wears a white three piece man's suit � la Marlene Dietrich as she greets her Nazi and French customers. She moves amongst the tables.)
JANEWAY: Welcome to Le Coeur de Lion. I'm Katrine. The first round is with my compliments, on one condition. You leave the war outside. More escargot for table nine. Jacques, no lady tonight? Oh, we'll have to see what we can do about that. 
(She sits at a table.)
JANEWAY: Forgive my neglecting you. Now, where were we? Ah, yes, my latest adventure in Paris. 
(She looks over to the bar and sees Tuvok nod towards the entrance. Two Hirogen Nazi officers are entering.)
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I'll have to neglect you again. Excuse me. 
(She goes to the bar.)
TUVOK: That's him. 
JANEWAY: Our new Kommandant? 
TUVOK: British intelligence believes he's been sent here to oversee the occupation of the city. 
JANEWAY: What's his history? 
TUVOK: He served with Rommel in North Africa and Schmidt in Poland. He is a formidable military strategist, notorious for his cruelty. 
JANEWAY: Ah. Let's make him feel at home. Send him a bottle of Chateau LaTour. My compliments. 
TUVOK: The '29? 
JANEWAY: I hate to waste good wine. Give him the '36. 
TUVOK: As you wish. 
SEVEN: And I have waited so long. It must be right. It can't be wrong. 
(The song finishes, and she gets a round of applause.)
SEVEN: Merci. Be generous to Claude this evening. Without him, my voice is empty. Good evening. 
TURANJ: Sing. 
SEVEN: Tonight's performance is over. Return tomorrow. 
TURANJ: Now. 
SEVEN: Remove your hand. 
TURANJ: Obey me, or I will hunt you down and your bones will adorn the bulkhead of my ship. 
KARR: Sit down and play the game. In this setting, we have no ships. We are an ancient race of soldiers intent upon conquering this world. Play the game. 
JANEWAY: Now, now, what's this? Mademoiselle LeNeuf will be happy to sing another song. Just give her a few minutes to freshen up. 
SEVEN: It's late. 
JANEWAY: Freshen up. 
SEVEN: Very well. 
JANEWAY: Kommandant Karr. 
KARR: You know me. 
JANEWAY: Your reputation precedes you. I'm Katrine. Le Coeur de Lion is my establishment. The first round is with my compliments, on one condition. You leave the war outside. 
KARR: I wish to speak with her. Alone. 
(The nearby French patrons and the SS officer leave them.)
JANEWAY: Charming gentleman. 
KARR: He is disoriented. Your world is unfamiliar to him. 
JANEWAY: He'll be comfortable soon enough. The arms of France are open to all. 
KARR: I've heard otherwise. 
(They sit at a table.)
JANEWAY: What do you mean? 
KARR: I understand there is opposition to our presence here among your citizens. 
JANEWAY: The Resistance? In Paris perhaps. But this is a small city, defenceless. We've learned to be a little more diplomatic. When this war is over we want to remain on good terms with the victor. 
KARR: Whoever that may be. 
JANEWAY: Whoever that may be. 
(A waiter brings the wine and glasses.)
KARR: Your city may be defenceless, but it's crucial to the war. Any ground assault into Germany must pass through this province. The Resistance will come here. 
JANEWAY: If they do, I'll tell them what I tell everyone. Leave the war outside. 
(The Hirogen Alpha tries the wine.)
KARR: Excellent. 
(An Hirogen SS officer comes to the table.)
TURANJ: Kommandant, I've been informed there's a problem in the Engineering section. The warp plasma network has become unstable. 
JANEWAY: What's he talking about? 
KARR: It need not concern you. To the hunt. 
JANEWAY: The hunt? 
KARR: For the Resistance. I shall take great pleasure in tracking them down and making the kill. 
(He kisses her hand and leaves.)
JANEWAY: Au revoir. 
(Later, Seven is counting the takings.)
JANEWAY: How'd we do? 
SEVEN: Insufficient for a Saturday night. Twelve hundred forty seven francs and eighty one Reichmarks. 
JANEWAY: Well, it should be enough to buy an oscillator to extend the range of our radio. First thing tomorrow morning I want you to take a little trip to the countryside. There's a Monsieur Groleau who has a cottage just past the third bridge. He's got a wine cellar full of vacuum tubes. Tell him we need a high frequency oscillator. Offer him three hundred francs but don't go any higher than five hundred. 
SEVEN: We have more pressing needs. 
JANEWAY: Such as? 
SEVEN: Explosives. We need a launcher that can fire armour piercing grenades. 
JANEWAY: Planning on blowing up a German tank? 
SEVEN: If necessary. 
JANEWAY: We're not trying to build an army here. 
SEVEN: Then maybe it's time we did. Three more German battalions have occupied the city and a Panzer division is holding position eleven kilometres away. When the Americans arrive and the fighting begins, I don't intend to be standing next to a piano singing Moonlight Becomes You. 
JANEWAY: The Americans won't even be able to approach this city without our help. And if they can't liberate Sainte Claire the assault into Germany could fail. We need to be gathering information about German troop movements and relaying it to Allied Command. 
SEVEN: I'm tired of lighting the Nazi's cigarettes and laughing at their jokes. We should be helping the Allies by assassinating these pigs. 
JANEWAY: The moment we start shooting we expose ourselves. Right now, no one suspects us. And I am not about to risk our entire operation because you've suddenly developed a nervous trigger finger. 
SEVEN: That is your opinion, Madame. 
JANEWAY: I'm the leader of the movement here and right now my opinion is the only one that counts, so get the oscillator. I think we're all feeling the strain. It's been a hard four years. But believe me, the Third Reich is feeling it too. We just have to hang on a little while longer. Word from the Americans is going to come any day. 
SEVEN: Perhaps. 
(Seven leaves.)
TUVOK: Again? 
JANEWAY: Again. Why is she so adamant? What she's proposing would put us all at risk. 
TUVOK: Maybe that's her intention. 
JANEWAY: If you have suspicions, my old friend, let's hear them. 
TUVOK: From the beginning, she's been argumentative, and on more than a few occasions she's disobeyed your direct orders. 
JANEWAY: She's headstrong. Typical of the underground. 
TUVOK: Nevertheless, her behaviour has threatened our identities. 
JANEWAY: She's the only munitions expert we have, and she can carry a tune. We need her. Let's keep our eye on her. Have her followed for the next few days. If she is a Nazi infiltrator, we'll have to eliminate her. 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
(Neelix cycles down the road with baguettes and bottles of wine in his panniers.)
NEELIX: Bonjour, madame. 
WOMAN [OC]: Bonjour.
(Neelix snatches an apple as he passes a stall.)
NEELIX: Put it on my account. Guten Tag. 
TURANJ: You! Halt! 
(Neelix obeys.)
TURANJ: Get off your vehicle. What are you transporting? 
NEELIX: Nothing but the very essentials of life. 
(The Hirogen grabs a baguette and breaks it in two. Then he opens a bottle and pours the contents out.)
TURANJ: Proceed to your destination. 
NEELIX: That I will. That I most certainly will. 
TURANJ: If the choice were mine, you would already be dead. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
RADIO: More report rain. It's currently fifty nine degrees in Dover with low fog across the Channel. Temperatures are expected to range from a low of forty five degrees to 
(Torres is writing all this down when static breaks it up.)
TORRES: Damn, I'm missing it. 
(Meanwhile, Tuvok turns around a painting of a naked lady to look at a map fastened to the back.)
TUVOK: Our most recent intelligence shows two German divisions here and here. 
JANEWAY: How recent is this intelligence? 
TUVOK: Forty eight hours. 
JANEWAY: Old news. 
RADIO: I'm Reginald Smith and you're listening to the British Radio Network. This report will repeat in 
TORRES: Forty five seconds. 
RADIO: Forty five seconds. 
TORRES: Here's to English precision. 
(Someone knocks on the door. Janeway picks up a handgun.)
JANEWAY: We're closed. 
NEELIX [OC]: Morning delivery. 
(She lets him in.)
JANEWAY: You're late. What happened? 
NEELIX: Oh, just a t�te-�-t�te with a member of the Master Race. 
JANEWAY: That's the second time this week. Sounds like they're increasing their patrols. 
TUVOK: Perhaps it's time we chose another courier. Our baker is arousing suspicion. 
NEELIX: There's no need to worry. I change my route every day, and I've become quite friendly with most of the Gestapo. They just love my strudel. (Neelix carefully peels the label from the now empty bottle of Quart de Chaume.)
RADIO: A kind thank you to Jazzy McNulty and his Band. Now, the weather for today, September the twenty second, nineteen forty four. In London skies are grey, with a strong chance of afternoon rain. Temperatures will range from a low of fifty two degrees to a high of seventy one. The northern coast reports heavy rain and strong winds, ocean swells reaching four feet. Devonshire, Hertfordshire and Summershire all report rain. It's currently fifty nine degrees in Dover with low fog across the Channel. Temperatures are expected to range from a low of forty five degrees to a high of sixty three. I am Reginald Smith and you are listening 
(Torres turns off the radio.)
TORRES: Got it. Let's see the code key. 
JANEWAY: Every fifth letter, every third vowel. Use the Sunday decryption sequence. A, H, C. Straight from Allied High Command. 
NEELIX: It must be important. 
TUVOK: All messages regarding the war are important. It's only a matter of degree. 
NEELIX: I suppose you're right, but do you have to be so logical about everything? 
TUVOK: In any covert battle, logic is a potent weapon. You might try it sometime. 
JANEWAY: American Fourth Infantry to invade Sainte Claire Tuesday dawn. 
NEELIX: That's two days from now. 
JANEWAY: Require assistance. Disable enemy communications. End message. 
TUVOK: The German radio transmitter is housed at their headquarters. 
NEELIX: That building is surrounded by guards. We can't just waltz in there and plant a bomb. 
TORRES: Maybe I can help. 
JANEWAY: How? 
TORRES: I'm upset. I need to see my special friend. Even if it means bothering him at the office. 
TUVOK: A reconnaissance mission. 
TORRES: I'll try to locate the radio, see where the guards are posted, examine the locks. Gather enough information to get us inside. 
JANEWAY: It's too dangerous. If you're caught, you'll be tortured for information. 
TORRES: You don't know my friend. He would never do anything to harm his own child. 
(For the only time this season, the show acknowledges Roxanne's real-life pregnancy.)
JANEWAY: Encode a response to Allied Command. Confirm that we've received their message. Tell them we're proceeding according to plan. 
[Outside German HQ] 
(A woman spits at the ground when she sees Torres. Torres goes closer to the building, then grabs at her belly and stumbles. The guard comes over to help her, and they speak in German.)
GUARD: Was es ist, Fr�ulein? 
TORRES: Ich mu� mit ihrem Hauptmann sprechen.
GUARD: Kommen hier.
(He helps her go inside.) 
[Kapitan's office] 
(The Kapitan is a human, and an SS officer.)
KAPITAN: Ever since my days at the university I've admired this painting, and now it's mine. Our fellow officers might prefer gold or land, but for me the greatest prize of war is art. 
KARR: Trophies of the hunt. But was the hunt fair? 
KAPITAN: Sir? 
KARR: We entered this city with superior firepower against a weakened prey. Do you really deserve these prizes? 
KAPITAN: We are German. The German people deserve Europe and everything in it. 
KARR: Why? 
NAZI: Sir, you question our destiny? 
KARR: Of course not. But I want to hear it in your own words. Tell me, why are we the Master Race? 
KAPITAN: Our blood is pure. Our people lived and hunted on this land for a thousand years before the degenerate races brought their corruption. Europe must be purified. 
KARR: You yourself, are you stronger than these degenerate races? More cunning? 
KAPITAN: Yes, of course. 
KARR: And if you were alone without an army supporting you, would you continue the hunt? If your prey were armed instead of defenceless, what then? 
KAPITAN: I, Colonel, I, I don't know what you're trying 
(The Hirogen grabs his throat.)
KARR: You are superior to no one! Never underestimate your prey or disrespect its abilities. If you do, you will become the hunted. When the opposing army invades this city, remember my words. 
(The Kapitan nods. There is a knock on the door.)
KARR: Enter. 
(Torres is shown in. A copy of Da Vinci's lost Leda and the Swan is one of the paintings on the wall.)
KAPITAN: Brigitte. 
TORRES: I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to come here. Don't blame him. I told him that I was ill and I had to see you. 
KARR: I will leave you two alone. 
KAPITAN: Heil Hitler! 
(The Alpha leaves without returning the salute.)
KAPITAN: It's all right, the Colonel is in a strange mood today. 
(He hugs Torres.)
KAPITAN: What's wrong? Is it our child? 
TORRES: I don't know. I was dizzy. 
KAPITAN: I'll call the doctor. 
TORRES: No. I feel better now. Maybe I just needed to see you. Why haven't you shown me this place before? 
KAPITAN: I didn't want your neighbours to see you coming here. They make it difficult enough, knowing we're together. 
TORRES: I don't care what they think. It's beautiful. 
(She is referring to a small sculpture on a side table.)
KAPITAN: Praxiteles, master sculptor of ancient Greece. There are only three like this in all of Europe. 
TORRES: So many wonderful things.
(Including a soldier with headphones on sitting at a radio set.) 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
(Two Hirogen are walking together. )
TURANJ: The Kommandant would have us continue this simulation until we rot. It's pointless. We should begin the hunt. He believes we must learn more about our prey, but I have learned enough. Ready your weapon. Avoid the cranium. 
(Neelix is wheeling his bicycle along the street. They shoot at him. People scatter, but Seven shoots back.)
SEVEN: This way. 
NEELIX: But the message. 
SEVEN: There's no time! 
(They run around the corner and down an alleyway. The door they find is locked, but they are out of side when a motorbike and sidecar drive past. Neelix steps out of hiding, then Seven. The Hirogen Captain shoots her gun out of her hand, then both of them in the back as they try to run away.)
TURANJ: Computer, exit holodeck. We'll take them to the medical bay. 
[Sickbay] 
(The EMH is assisting the medic to treat Seven. Neelix is on another biobed.)
MEDIC: This neural interface has been damaged. 
EMH: That's because it took a direct hit when one of your bullets grazed the base of her skull. 
MEDIC: I'll provide you with another. Install it. 
EMH: Not until I've repaired her injuries. 
MEDIC: How long? 
EMH: She has two fractured vertebrae and a punctured lung. Another hour at least. 
MEDIC: Him? 
EMH: I've stabilised his vital systems, but he still has bullet fragments lodged in his shoulder. 
MEDIC: I will treat him. 
EMH: This time you might do a better job repairing the muscle lacerations. The last crewmember you treated was brought back in with internal bleeding. 
MEDIC: Your crew is fragile. They fall too easily. 
EMH: What do you expect? They've been stabbed, shot, beaten, phasered and bat'lethed over the past three weeks. Their bodies weren't designed for this kind of punishment. 
(The Hirogen Alpha enters.)
KARR: What happened? 
MEDIC: These prey were hunted by Turanj. Their injuries are severe. 
EMH: You assured me that your people would avoid causing serious head injuries. Another centimetre and the bullet would have penetrated her brain. If you can't keep your people under control, then you should put an end to this blood sport. 
KARR: The simulations will continue. 
EMH: At least activate the holodeck safety protocols. 
KARR: No. 
EMH: It'll prevent life-threatening injuries for your people as well. 
KARR: It will also eliminate the challenge. 
EMH: I have had twenty eight wounded and one fatality in the past twelve hours. Even I can't keep up with that level of triage. 
KARR: You will keep up or they will die. Their lives are in your hands, Doctor. Don't fail them. When that one is ready, place him in holodeck two. Let's see how he fares with the Klingons. 
MEDIC: What about her? 
KARR: Send her back to holodeck one. I like her voice. 
[Bridge] 
KARR: Progress? 
KIM: By cutting through the bulkheads on decks four, five and six we've been able to expand both holodeck grids by five thousand square metres. 
KARR: More. 
KIM: I can't give you any more. Not without compromising Voyager's primary systems. 
KARR: Then compromise them. 
KIM: Look, holodecks require a tremendous amount of energy. I've already rerouted power from all nonessential systems. Anything more, and we'll start losing propulsion, deflectors, even life support. 
KARR: I'll transfer a supply of power nodules from my vessel. Integrate them into your systems. I want to expand the holo-projectors into all surrounding sections. Replicate enough emitters for the task. 
(The Alpha walks away.)
KIM: Yes, sir. 
[Corridor] 
(Kim is working with a black crewman. An Hirogen stands guard nearby.)
KIM: The holo-emitters in this corridor are stable. Let's start working on section nineteen. (sotto) But first, tell the guard to escort you to Engineering. That we need more equipment. Specifically, a type three isolinear emitter. If he gives you any trouble, say I can't complete the assignment without it. 
(The crewman goes to their guard.)
ASHMORE: We need an isolinear emitter from Engineering. 
(The guard escorts Ashmore, and they both get into the turbolift. Kim summons the EMH.)
EMH: Ensign, how did I get here? 
KIM: I transferred you here, using the new emitters in this section. 
EMH: I assume you've got a plan? 
KIM: Half a plan. 
EMH: Let's hear it. 
KIM: Before we can retake the ship, we've got to get the crew back. That means disabling the neural interfaces. 
EMH: Easier said than done. The great Hunters are everywhere you turn. 
KIM: Don't worry, I think I've found a way to tap into the Sickbay diagnostic console. The only catch is 
(The guard and Ashmore return.) 
KIM: Standby with the emitter. I'm almost done here. 
(Kim goes around the corner and the EMH reappears.)
EMH: The catch, Ensign? 
KIM: Somebody's got to be inside the holodeck to engage the bridge control relays. 
EMH: We're short-handed. 
KIM: I know. 
EMH: Well, we've got a Borg on board, don't we? Maybe we can put her to good use. 
[Ready room] 
(Redecorated in the Hirogen style. The Hirogen SS officer enters.)
KARR: I've been studying Voyager's database looking for our next simulation. There are many to choose from. These people have a violent history. I believe I've found a worthy prey. The Borg. When World War Two is over, we will recreate a notorious battle known as Wolf 359. 
TURANJ: I look forward to it. 
KARR: I thought you might. But if you continue to disobey me, this is one hunt you will never see. You nearly destroyed two of my favourite prey. You were careless. 
TURANJ: I've become impatient. We penetrated this vessel, overcame their defences, and in the moment of the kill, you forced us to stop. Now we play these incessant games. It's time we took our trophies and moved on. 
KARR: Your lust for the kill has blinded you, like many young hunters. If you took the time to study your prey, to understand its behaviour, you might learn something. 
TURANJ: There is nothing to be learned. 
KARR: You're wrong. Each prey exposes us to another way of life and makes us re-evaluate our own. Have you considered our future? What would become of us when we have hunted this territory to exhaustion? 
TURANJ: We will travel to another part of space, search for new prey, as we have always done. 
KARR: A way of life that hasn't changed for a thousand years. 
TURANJ: Why should it? 
KARR: Species that don't change, die. We've lost our way. We've allowed our predatory instincts to dominate us. We disperse ourselves throughout the quadrant, sending ships in all directions. We've become a solitary race, isolated. We've spread ourselves too thin. We're no longer a culture. We have no identity. In another thousand years, no one will remember the name Hirogen. Our people must come back together, combine forces, rebuild our civilisation. 
TURANJ: What of the hunt? 
KARR: The Hunt will always continue, but in a new way. I intend to transform this ship into a vast simulation, populated with a varied and endless supply of prey. In time, this technology can be duplicated for other Hirogen. These holodecks will allow us to hold onto our past, while we face the future. 
TURANJ: Even if I were persuaded, others wouldn't be. 
KARR: Then you are with me? I must continue my research. I'll see you tomorrow on holodeck one. The Americans are due to invade. 
[Sickbay] 
(The EMH wakes Seven and whispers in her ear.)
EMH: Remain calm and stay quiet. There's a Hirogen working in the bio-lab. He might hear us. What's the last thing you remember? 
SEVEN: An attack. Hirogen vessels. They breached our hull and boarded the ship. I was in a phaser fight on deck three. I was struck several times. That's all I remember. 
EMH: Then you have no memory of the simulations in the holodeck? 
SEVEN: None. 
EMH: The neural interface must be circumventing your memory centres. 
SEVEN: Neural interface? 
EMH: It's a subdermal transmitter that links your neocortex to the holodeck. In essence, it makes you believe you're a character within the programme. 
SEVEN: Why am I in Sickbay? 
EMH: You were wounded in a simulation. It's my job to patch you all up and send you back in. Half the crew is under lock and key. The rest are fighting for their lives on the holodeck. This has been going on for nineteen days. Dozens of battle scenarios, one more brutal than the last. You should see what a mess you were after the Crusades. 
SEVEN: Will I be sent into another simulation? 
EMH: Yes, but this time with an advantage. I have found a way to disable the interface by remodulating one of your Borg implants to emit a jamming signal. Once the Hirogen have brought you back to the holodeck, the jamming signal will activate within seconds. 
SEVEN: My objective? 
EMH: You mind a control panel inside the holodeck and engage the bridge access relays. That will enable Ensign Kim and me to deactivate all the neural interfaces. After Captain Janeway and the crew regain awareness, you can work with them to mount a resistance against the Hirogen. 
SEVEN: What simulation will I be entering? 
EMH: World War Two. A twentieth century Earth conflict. Do you know anything about it? 
SEVEN: Nothing. 
EMH: That could be a problem. Once the interface is disabled, you won't remember anything about your role in the simulation. Think of it as a new social setting. Do your best to fit in. 
MEDIC: This is the last neural interface. When you've finished with her, you'll help me replicate more. 
EMH: I have to sedate you now. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
SEVEN: (singing) That old black magic has me in it's spell. That old black magic that you weave so well. Those icy fingers up and down my spine. The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet 
(There is a fizzing sound and she stops, confused.)
SEVEN: I must discontinue this activity. I am not well. 
KARR: If the entertainment is over, I'll be going. 
JANEWAY: Stay right there, Kommandant. I'm sure she's fine. Let me talk to her. 
(Janeway goes to Seven at the bar.)
JANEWAY: What's wrong? 
SEVEN: I require a glass of water. 
JANEWAY: Make it a quick one. I promised the Kommandant you'd be singing till midnight. I want to get a lot of information out of him tonight. 
SEVEN: I am ill. 
JANEWAY: Look, I don't care if you're dying. Get back out there. 
SEVEN: I won't. 
(Seven walks away.) 
JANEWAY: Maybe you're right about her. 
TUVOK: The evidence is increasing. She was present today when our courier was shot down in the street, yet somehow, she was unharmed. And now, on the eve of our liberation, she becomes uncooperative. 
JANEWAY: Leave this to me. 
[US Army - Captain's Tent] 
(Under a picture of President Roosevelt, a Native American with a nice tattoo over his left eye studies and marks maps.)
PARIS: Captain? 
CHAKOTAY: At ease. What's the word? 
PARIS: There is no word. At least not from the Resistance in Sainte Claire. 
CHAKOTAY: Then we won't get any support from inside the city. 
PARIS: You may be underestimating the good citizens of Sainte Claire. I spent a summer there when I was eighteen. 
CHAKOTAY: Let me guess. You ate a few snails, fell in love with a local girl and became an expert on the city? 
PARIS: Ah, well, yeah, pretty much like that. 
CHAKOTAY: I see. 
PARIS: But believe me, Captain, those people love their town. They'll fight for it and die for it. Don't count them out yet. 
CHAKOTAY: All right, but I won't count them in, either. We continue as planned. An assault from the north at first light. So, who was the mademoiselle? 
PARIS: Her name was Brigitte. Great gams. One hell of a temper. 
CHAKOTAY: Sounds like your kind of girl. 
PARIS: August 29, 1936, 12:17 p.m. That's when my train pulled out of Sainte Claire. That's the last time I saw her. We wrote to each other every week for three years. Then the war broke out and I never heard from her again. 
CHAKOTAY: Sainte Claire's not a big place. She shouldn't be too hard to find. 
PARIS: I'm counting on it. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
JANEWAY: You'll maintain position here, twenty metres from the front doors. Arm yourself with a submachine gun and watch for any sign of trouble. 
TUVOK: Understood. 
JANEWAY: Now, we've observed a twenty second break in the guard rotation at four fifteen a.m. That should you and me enough time to enter the building through the storm window on the eastern wall. 
TORRES: When I was there yesterday I saw guards posted at all three stairways. You'll have to reach the second floor through the elevator shaft. The command post is in the main gallery at the end of the hall. 
JANEWAY: Once inside, we plant the charges, blow the transmitter. You'll remain here. If something goes wrong and we're caught, destroy all evidence of the Underground. Our contact list, decryption codes, everything. 
TORRES: Right. 
JANEWAY: We leave in one hour. 
(Seven looks at a grenade. Janeway picks up a bar of plastic explosive.)
JANEWAY: This won't make much of a bang. You forgot to connect the detonator. 
SEVEN: I will correct the error. 
JANEWAY: It's lucky I found your little error. It might have undermined our mission. Are you having second thoughts about tonight? 
SEVEN: No. 
JANEWAY: Good, because I don't want any more mistakes. 
SEVEN: There won't be any. 
JANEWAY: Let's hope not. 
[Mess hall] 
EMH: We've got to stop meeting like this. 
KIM: I managed to grab a quick scan of holodeck one, and it looks like Seven of Nine is on the move. Are you ready in Sickbay? 
EMH: My Hirogen taskmaster is working in the bio-lab. I'll have access to the medical console for another twenty minutes at least. 
KIM: That'll give me enough time to get to the bridge. 
(The EMH vanishes and two Hirogen enter.)
KIM: Good afternoon. 
YOUNG HIROGEN: What are you doing in here? 
KIM: Trying to get the replicator system back online. Unless you prefer the emergency rations? Personally, I'm getting tired of synthetic protein. You're supposed to be the finest hunters in the quadrant, why don't you find us something a little more tasty? Is something wrong? 
YOUNG HIROGEN: An unauthorised transmission was sent from this room. 
KIM: What kind of transmission? 
YOUNG HIROGEN: I don't know. Maybe you can tell me. 
KIM: Well, I was trying to re-route power from the main computer to the replicators. Of course. I must have tripped a communications subroutine. Sorry about that. Didn't mean to worry you. Your people have damaged just about every system on this vessel. Accidents are bound to happen. Now, if you don't mind, I'm due on the bridge. 
YOUNG HIROGEN: Show it to me. 
KIM: What? 
YOUNG HIROGEN: I want to see this subroutine. Show me what you were doing when the accident occurred. 
KIM: Forget it. I don't have time. 
(The Hirogen knocks Kim down.)
YOUNG HIROGEN: Do as I say. 
KIM: All right! But you'd better call the bridge. Tell your superior I'm going to be late, that I'm working under your orders now, not his. Go ahead, make the call. I don't want to take the blame for this. 
YOUNG HIROGEN: Report to the bridge. 
KIM: Thanks. 
[Kapitan's office] 
(The radio operator is writing down a Morse code transmission. Janeway knocks him out.)
JANEWAY: Set the charges here, here and there. This looks like a message from one of their reconnaissance teams. 
(Janeway takes the headphones and listens. Seven removes books from a shelf to reveal the holodeck controls.)
JANEWAY: These must be instructions for troop deployments. The Germans must be taking up new positions outside the city. It looks like they're mobilising more troops than our sources originally expected. 
(The computer beeps up on the bridge. A monitor at the back of Ops says Holodeck One Access Enabled. Kim works consoles, and one in Sickbay proclaims Neural Interface Access Enabled. The EMH presses buttons to bring up Janeway's personnel file.) 
JANEWAY: They're moving armoured units into the valley. They must know the Americans are coming. We've got to warn them somehow. What are you doing? You haven't set the charges. What is that? 
SEVEN: I believe it is a transmitter. I'm attempting to disable it. 
JANEWAY: You're sending a message to the Nazis. 
SEVEN: No. 
JANEWAY: Step away, or I'll kill you. 
[Sickbay] 
MEDIC: What are you doing? 
EMH: Er, nothing. Just running a diagnostic. 
MEDIC: You've accessed the neural interface controls. Stop it immediately. 
[Kapitan's office] 
JANEWAY: I told you no more mistakes. You've just made your last one. 
(Janeway starts to squeeze the trigger on her gun. In Sickbay the console says Neural Interface Disabled. Janeway gets a stab of pain below her ear.) 
JANEWAY: Ow! Seven? 
SEVEN: Captain. 
[Holodeck two - Klingon simulation] 
(As a Klingon.)
NEELIX: Listen. A targ, just beyond that ridge. 
KARR: You would hunt down a simple beast even in the midst of our enemies? 
NEELIX: There is no enemy as great as hunger. 
(The Alpha's comms beeps.)
KARR: Why am I being interrupted? 
[Sickbay] 
MEDIC: The holographic Doctor, he's disabled their Captain's interface. 
KARR [OC]: How? 
MEDIC: I don't know, but I can't re-establish the link. 
KARR: Send a team 
[Holodeck two - Klingon simulation] 
KARR: To holodeck one. Remove her from the simulation. 
[Kapitan's office] 
(Outside, Tuvok fires his machine gun at a pair of Hirogen.)
SEVEN: Hirogen hunters. 
JANEWAY: Internal scans show thirteen of them on this holodeck. 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
CHAKOTAY: Need a hand, buddy? Captain Miller, Fifth Armoured Infantry. 
TUVOK: Welcome to Sainte Claire. 
CHAKOTAY: Get me artillery unit Charlie One. Take up positions along this street and start laying down fire. 
[Kapitan's office] 
(A Klaxon wails.)
SEVEN: The Americans have arrived. 
[Bridge] 
KARR: You circumvented our control. How? 
KIM: Go to hell! 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
(Torres takes a rifle from behind the bar and takes up position by the door. A figure enters.)
TORRES: Bobby. 
PARIS: You owe me a postcard. 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
CHAKOTAY: Distance eight hundred yards. Correct for crosswinds. Fire at will. Take cover, boys. Charlie One isn't known for accuracy. 
[Kapitan's office] 
(Seven watches from the windows as Janeway works the holodeck controls.)
JANEWAY: I can't access the ship's systems Didn't you say this was Nazi headquarters? 
SEVEN: I did. 
JANEWAY: Then it would stand to reason this building is being targeted. Let's get out of here.
(They run out of the front door. A missile makes a direct hit on the building.) 
[Bridge] 
(Voyager rocks.)
KARR: What happened? 
KIM: There was a simulated explosion on holodeck one. Somehow it blew out the hologrid across three decks. 
KARR: Is the programme still running? 
KIM: Yes. 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
(Where the building was is now a cross-section of several decks, with energy playing around the edges.)
TUVOK: What is it? 
CHAKOTAY: It looks like a bunker. 
(He grabs the field radio.)
CHAKOTAY: All units, listen up. We've just blown the lid off of some kind of secret Nazi compound. Converge on my position. We're going in. 
[Bridge] 
KIM: The breach opened the simulation into the surrounding sections. I'm picking up holographic soldiers moving into deck five. 
KARR: Shut down the holo-emitters until we can regain control. 
KIM: I can't. The programme controls are offline. You wanted a war? Looks like you've got one. 
To Be Continued... 
[Sainte Claire - Street]
CHAKOTAY: Move out.
[Corridor] 
(Janeway and Seven shoot a pair of German soldiers.)
JANEWAY: Looks like the Hirogen have been busy. This entire section has been equipped with holo-emitters. Let's get to Astrometrics. 
[Astrometrics] 
(A German officer there has to cross the room for his gun. Janeway knocks him out.)
SEVEN: There are eighty five Hirogen on board, concentrated on decks two through nine. 
JANEWAY: What about the bridge? 
SEVEN: Four Hirogen and Ensign Kim. 
JANEWAY: At least he's alive. The neural interfaces. You said they're controlled through Sickbay. 
SEVEN: Yes. There's only one Hirogen in Sickbay with the Doctor, but the corridors outside are heavily guarded. 
JANEWAY: That's our first objective, disable the interfaces. But we'll need help. 
SEVEN: We did have allies in the World War Two simulation. The French Resistance. 
JANEWAY: It's time we mount a resistance of our own. 
[Bridge] 
KIM: The battle was concentrated here, on holodeck one, but the fighting has spilled out onto decks five and six and it looks like a group of holographic Americans is invading deck seven. 
KARR: Show me the breach in the hologrid. 
(The monitor behind Kim goes blank.)
KIM: I've lost the visual link. It was the last active circuit connecting the bridge to the holodecks. There's only one way to stop this. I need to go to Engineering and initiate a power surge across the holo-emitter network. It'll blow out the entire system. 
KARR: No. That would destroy both the holodecks. 
KIM: Look, simulation or not, if this battle keeps going we could all be killed. 
KARR: I want that technology preserved. 
TURANJ: Commander. 
KARR: Status. 
TURANJ: I was able to reach deck five but holographic forces are massing near the breach. If I'm to get into the holodeck, I'll need help. 
KARR: Take the hunters from the Klingon simulation. 
TURANJ: When I find Captain Janeway, should I kill her? 
KARR: No. Bring her to me. 
TURANJ: This is no longer a game. This hunt is real. We should kill the prey. 
KARR: The Voyager crew must remain alive to make repairs, or we could lose everything. This vessel, it's technology. You said that you understood the importance of what we're doing here. 
TURANJ: I'll get the hunters. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
CHAKOTAY: We think it's a secret compound the Nazi's built after they took over the city. What I don't understand is how they managed to camouflage it so well. 
TUVOK: Indeed. We've been scruitinising German troop movements since the Occupation. We knew nothing of this installation. 
PARIS: Don't sweat it. Our recon planes missed it too. Any idea what they're hiding in there, Captain? 
CHAKOTAY: We saw all sorts of scientific equipment. Strange metals, instruments we can't identify. I've relayed the findings to Military Intelligence. They believe this could be an advanced munitions laboratory, designed to build some kind of super-weapon. 
PARIS: We've got to put it out of business. 
CHAKOTAY: I've already sent three squads in, but the Nazi's are putting up one hell of a fight. I've requested additional troops. Lieutenant, this restaurant will serve as our command post. Set up the transmitter and post guards around the perimeter. 
PARIS: Yes, sir. 
CHAKOTAY: You've done a bang-up job, but we'll take it from here. Tell your people to lie low, and that the Americans said thanks. 
TORRES: This is our city. We have no intention of lying low. 
CHAKOTAY: Listen, honey, the time for sneaking messages back and forth is over. This is war, and you aren't soldiers. 
TUVOK: He's right. We have weapons hidden throughout the city. Brigitte will tell you where they are. 
CHAKOTAY: Sounds good. Lieutenant, take care of it. 
(Chakotay and Tuvok leave them alone.)
PARIS: I can see you haven't changed. 
TORRES: Bring me one of those street maps. Most of the guns, we stole from the German army, the explosives we bought on the black market. 
PARIS: We could use both. 
TORRES: Our biggest stockpile is buried here, two metres below the last row of seats of the Cin�ma Myst�re. You remember it, don't you? 
PARIS: Hmm. I'm No Angel, with Mae West. There's heavy fighting in that area. What's the best way in? 
TORRES: We dug a tunnel that leads directly to the stockpile. Here, I'll show you. Incidentally, we saw Death Takes a Holiday. 
PARIS: It was the Mae West movie, I'm sure of it. She was singing Sister Honky Tonk, and I put my arm around you. And during the courtroom scene, I kissed you. 
TORRES: You know, I think you're right. 
PARIS: I guess the experience wasn't exactly burned into your memory. 
TORRES: Not the movie, but I do remember the kiss. 
PARIS: So, did you get my last letter? 
TORRES: You mean the one asking me to leave France? 
PARIS: Germany was about to invade. I thought you'd be safer back in the States with me. But, I guess you found someone else to take care of you. 
TORRES: There's never been anybody else. 
PARIS: Then who? 
TORRES: He's second in command of the Sainte Claire occupation. The first time he saw me, he said I was pretty. I took advantage of his interest. He doesn't know I'm in the Resistance. The child is his. 
PARIS: I'm sorry. 
TORRES: So am I. 
(There is a noise from behind the bar. Everyone points a gun at it. A Jefferies tube hatch opens and Janeway looks out.)
JANEWAY: Hold your fire. 
TUVOK: Katrine. You survived. 
JANEWAY: Are you surprised? 
TUVOK: Very. Nazi headquarters was destroyed. We assumed you were killed in the explosion. 
TORRES: What is that? Some kind of an escape tunnel? 
SEVEN: That's precisely what it is. 
CHAKOTAY: You're the leader of the local Resistance. 
JANEWAY: That's right. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain Miller, Fifth Armoured Infantry. This is Lieutenant Davis. I take it you've seen the German bunker we uncovered? 
JANEWAY: I just came from there. 
CHAKOTAY: We suspect it's a munitions lab. Can you confirm that? 
JANEWAY: Yes, a munitions lab. 
CHAKOTAY: Then this is it. We're calling in an air strike. Contact the RAF. 
JANEWAY: Hold on, Captain. There's an easier way to do this with the minimum of casualties. 
CHAKOTAY: Let's hear it. 
JANEWAY: I've located the generator that powers the entire complex. It's heavily guarded, but with your help I can get close enough to set off some explosives. 
CHAKOTAY: My orders are to blow the entire compound before the Germans send in reinforcements. 
JANEWAY: I saw technology in there you can't begin to imagine. Warheads powerful enough to destroy this entire valley if they're accidentally detonated. Call for an air strike, it may be the last call you make. 
CHAKOTAY: How can you get close enough? 
JANEWAY: This tunnel. I've been watching this compound for several months, and I've got a man inside. 
PARIS: The place is crawling with Krauts. 
JANEWAY: Yhat's why I need your help. If your men can clear these two corridors it'll give us access to this entryway. Get me there, and I can take care of the rest. 
CHAKOTAY: C Company, what's there status? 
PARIS: They're holding position about two hundred yards from here. 
CHAKOTAY: Get them on the horn. You'll lead us into the compound, but I'm coming with you. 
JANEWAY: I work better alone. 
CHAKOTAY: This isn't a request, it's an order. 
JANEWAY: Order? Do I look like I'm wearing one of your uniforms? I go alone. 
CHAKOTAY: I thought you needed our help. I'll be right behind you. 
(The men leave Janeway and Seven alone. Janeway packs a rucksack.)
JANEWAY: Even if I manage to disrupt the neural interfaces, we've still got a war to fight. We're going to need something a lot more effective than these old firearms. 
SEVEN: I believe I can enhance these weapons using Borg technology, but I'll have to access Cargo Bay two. 
JANEWAY: If something goes wrong and I don't succeed, you'll be the only one left who knows what's really going on. 
SEVEN: Understood. 
(Janeway walks away from the bar and is confronted by Tuvok.)
TUVOK: Have our suspicions been confirmed? 
JANEWAY: Suspicions? 
TUVOK: Is she a collaborator? 
JANEWAY: I think we can trust her. 
TUVOK: Are you certain? Three hours ago you were prepared to put a bullet in her head. 
JANEWAY: She's on our side. 
TUVOK: In your absence, I may be forced to make that determination for myself. 
JANEWAY: I've already made it. You're not to harm her. Is that understood? 
(Gunfire shatters a window.)
TUVOK: German forces are advancing on our position. 
CHAKOTAY: Let's give them a warm welcome. Mademoiselle, after you.
(Janeway and Chakotay enter the Jefferies tube.) 
[Sickbay] 
(A crewman is lying on a biobed.)
EMH: Punctured lung, arterial rupture, fracture of the thirteenth vertebra. He needs surgery. 
(An Hirogen Nazi is brought in.)
MEDIC: First and second degree burns to the face and neck. Treat him. 
EMH: His injuries are minor. He can wait. 
MEDIC: I said treat him. 
EMH: This man has massive internal injuries. If I don't operate now, he'll die. 
MEDIC: Treat the burns, or I'll deactivate your programme. 
EMH: What kind of physician are you? The first rule of triage states that the critical injuries take priority. 
MEDIC: You're rules, not mine. 
(He deactivates the EMH.)
MEDIC: From now on, leave the wounded prey where they fall. Tend only to our own. 
[Holodeck two - Klingon programme] 
(A trio of Klingons are getting drunk.)
NEELIX: I'm as dry as the crater at Tarpahk. In the middle of the dry season. When it's dry! 
KLINGON: No! I'm not done! 
NEELIX: Share with your brothers. It's the eve of battle. I may be drunk, but I can still send your soul to the next world and leave your body here to rot. Though from the stench of it, I'd say it's begun to already. 
(The Klingon passes out.) 
[Corridor] 
(Machinegun fire nearby. A holographic Nazi aims his weapon at Kim, and gets shot by -)
KIM: Tom! 
PARIS: Wrong guy. You speak English? 
KIM: Yeah. I speak English. 
PARIS: American? 
KIM: I didn't see him coming. You saved my life.
PARIS: Why are you out of uniform? What Company are you with? 
KIM: Well, er, I'm a civilian. 
PARIS: In the middle of a battle zone in France? The hell you are. 
(More gunfire. The GI with Paris moves forward.)
PARIS: Go one, I'm right behind you. Look, I don't have time for twenty questions. You say you're an American? All right then. If Betty Grable came around that corner, what part of her would you be staring at? Sorry. Time's up. 
KIM: Her legs! I'd be staring at her legs. 
PARIS: Bull's-eye. Lucky for you.
(Paris moves on.) 
[Jefferies tube] 
CHAKOTAY: You're a gung-ho kind of gal, aren't ya? 
JANEWAY: Does that bother you? 
CHAKOTAY: Nope. Just not used to it, that's all. The girls back home are a little different. 
JANEWAY: I guess when it comes to my people's safety, this girl tends to get a little gung-ho. 
CHAKOTAY: Nothing to apologise for. I'm the same way with my men. There's not a day goes by when I don't think to myself, I'm going to get 'em back safely, even if I die trying. 
JANEWAY: I know the feeling. We're about to enter some caves that run under the town. 
CHAKOTAY: Caves? 
JANEWAY: We're going to meet our contact there. I should warn you. There are eccentric people who live in the caves, but don't be alarmed. 
[Holodeck two - Klingon programme] 
(A drinking song is being mangled.)
JANEWAY: Good evening, gentlemen. 
NEELIX: Who are you? How did you get past our battle lines? 
JANEWAY: We're friends, allies. 
NEELIX: Sent by what house? 
JANEWAY: The house of K'toh-maag. 
NEELIX: K'toh-maag. I never heard of it. 
JANEWAY: I'm not surprised. It's a long way from here. 
NEELIX: This battle doesn't concern you. 
JANEWAY: Maybe not. But we'd be honoured to fight alongside such great warriors. If you prefer, we'll take our weapons elsewhere. 
NEELIX: Wait! I'll consider your request. But first, prove your fortitude. Drink! SanRoh t'patoh Cha! 
(The skin of bloodwine is thrown to Chakotay.)
CHAKOTAY: I guess my French is a little rusty. 
JANEWAY: Don't drink it. It's twice as strong as whisky. I'll be right back. 
(Janeway takes the rucksack and leaves them to find a computer interface.) 
NEELIX [OC]: Prove your fortitude, warrior. Drink!
EMH: Captain. Is, is it you? 
JANEWAY: Yes. We've got to disable the rest of those interfaces. 
EMH: The controls are routed through the surgical console in Sickbay, but it will take time to disable all of them. 
JANEWAY: We don't have time. I'll access the Jefferies tube that runs under that deck plate, set a few charges and blow out the console. 
EMH: Charges? The Hirogen have seized the armoury. 
JANEWAY: No problem. I've got all the ammo I need right here. 
EMH: Holographic explosives? 
JANEWAY: With the safety protocols offline, they're as good as the real thing. 
(They return to the Klingons.)
NEELIX: Another of your warriors? 
JANEWAY: Yes. 
NEELIX: He's a frail looking thing. 
JANEWAY: I'll contact you when I've disabled the rest of the interfaces. In the meantime, stay here. 
EMH: With the Klingons? 
JANEWAY: Believe me, it's peaceful compared to Sainte Claire. Captain. 
NEELIX: Ha! 
(Klingon Neelix slaps the EMH on the back.)
EMH: Please, don't do that. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
PARIS: They've got us outnumbered. 
TORRES: And outgunned. They're setting up a machine gun emplacement across the street. 
TUVOK: Where have you been? 
(Seven crawls out of the Jefferies tube.)
SEVEN: Obtaining supplies. 
TUVOK: What is this? 
SEVEN: German technology taken from their compound. I can use them to enhance our weapons. 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
TURANJ: I've cornered several Voyager crewmen. They've taken refuge in a guarded building. I need three nucleonic charges to penetrate the structure. 
[Bridge] 
KARR: Nucleonic charges could damage the holodeck further. Use your hand weapons. 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
TURANJ: Then I'll need more hunters. 
KARR [OC]: They're on the way. 
[Jefferies tube] 
JANEWAY: Damn, there's a level nine forcefield around the surgical console. We'll have to go in and shut it down. 
CHAKOTAY: Forcefield? 
JANEWAY: I'll explain later. Set the detonator for five minutes. 
[Doctor's office] 
MEDIC: Five hunters have been killed in the last hour. You must engage the safety protocols. 
KARR [on monitor]: Those protocols aren't functioning. 
MEDIC: Then I'll need assistance to 
(He hears a hatch opening.) 
MEDIC: Stand by. 
[Sickbay]
MEDIC: You. 
JANEWAY: Get him out of here. 
CHAKOTAY: There are ten pounds of dynamite under the floor set to blow in less than three minutes. Move.
(Chakotay escorts the Medic out at gunpoint. Janeway uses the desk computer in the office to access Auxilliary Systems 0470. Sickbay Security Field Authorized Access Only.) 
[Bridge] 
KARR: Bridge to Sickbay. Sickbay, respond. Bridge to deck five. Converge on the Sickbay.
(Janeway disables the Sickbay Security Field. Chakotay shoots at a pair of Hirogen who come around the corner outside, and the Medic overpowers him. He enters Sickbay and shoots Janeway in the leg. She runs out through the Medical lab and he goes to his computer. Access denied. KaBOOM! The Sickbay doors are blown out.) 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
(Paris and Torres grab the back of their necks in pain. Tuvok likewise.)
SEVEN: We are on the holodeck under attack. You must 
(The Kapitan enters with Hirogens. The Resistance and their allies are taken prisoner.)
TURANJ: Bridge, this is holodeck one. I have seized the building, and I have found another access to this holodeck. 
[Ready room] 
KARR: Seal it. How many captives? 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
TURANJ: Four. Their neural interfaces have been disabled. I will make the kill. 
KARR [OC]: No. 
[Ready room] 
KARR: They are not prey, they are hostages. I'll need them. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
TURANJ: As you wish. You, help me seal this hatch. 
PARIS: What do you think? A boy or a girl? 
SEVEN: It's a holographic projection. 
TORRES: Unfortunately, it's a very good projection. I feel twenty kilos heavier. It even kicks. 
TUVOK: I don't recognise this programme. 
PARIS: I do. He's wearing a Nazi uniform. We're on Earth during the Second World War. 
SEVEN: Nazi? 
PARIS: Totalitarian fanatics bent on world conquest. The Borg of their day. No offence. 
SEVEN: None taken. 
TORRES: What are you staring at? 
KAPITAN: Get up. You deceived me. 
TORRES: Really? 
KAPITAN: I should've seen through your flirtations. 
TORRES: If you say so. 
KAPITAN: The thought of you carrying my child disgusts me. 
TORRES: You're not the only one. 
(The Kapitan slaps Torres. Paris rises to protect her.)
PARIS: Look, I don't know what went on between the two of you, but it's obviously over now. 
KAPITAN: I see you're acquainted. Do you find her as attractive as I once did? I'll miss our nights together. 
PARIS: Pig! 
(The Kapitan aims his gun at Paris.)
TURANJ: Put the weapon away. Now. 
(He obeys and walks away.)
PARIS: Funny, he doesn't seem like your type. 
[Holodeck two - Klingon programme] 
NEELIX: Doctor, trouble. 
EMH: Now what? 
NEELIX: The Klingons are starting to wake up from their nap. 
EMH: All right, all right, hold on. 
NEELIX: What are you doing? 
EMH: I've established an interface with holodeck one. I want to monitor what's going on over there in case the crew needs my help. 
KLINGON: Qapla'! 
NEELIX: Uh-oh. What should we do? 
EMH: Not having a cure for Klingon hangovers, I couldn't tell you. 
KLINGON: The battle has begun. Our plan is to penetrate the enemy's position, cut his forces in half. 
NEELIX: And a very good plan it is. Best of luck with it. 
KLINGON: You will lead us into battle, Great Warrior.
(He throws a bat'leth to Neelix.)
NEELIX: Maybe I'll just watch from here. Try to offer up some pointers as things develop. 
KLINGON: Sto'Kar! Lead the attack or die here by my hand. 
EMH: You heard him. Don't argue with the man, run along! I'll reattach any severed limbs. Just don't misplace them. 
KLINGON: You! Cover our flank! 
(He gives the EMH a d'k tahg dagger.)
KLINGON: Qapla'! 
NEELIX: Qapla'. 
EMH: Tally-ho. 
[Ready room] 
KARR: Enter. Leave her. 
JANEWAY: I see you've done some redecorating. 
KARR: Your attempt to retake this vessel was inventive. From the day I seized Voyager, you put up a dauntless fight. But your fight is over now. You're going to help me shut down these simulations and repair the holodecks. 
JANEWAY: No. We'll destroy this ship before we surrender it. 
KARR: Don't threaten me, Captain. I've faced far more intimidating prey than you. If this fight continues, I promise you I will hunt down and kill every member of your crew. 
JANEWAY: Well, by then this ship will be damaged beyond repair and there won't be much of a trophy left, will there? 
KARR: Perhaps I should kill you and find someone who will cooperate. 
JANEWAY: Good luck. You'll get the same response from all of them. 
KARR: You don't realise what's at stake. 
JANEWAY: I know what's at stake. Your sick little game. 
KARR: This is not a game! 
JANEWAY: Then what is it? 
KARR: I'm trying to create a future for my people. 
JANEWAY: Future? 
KARR: I don't expect you to understand. You are prey. 
JANEWAY: You underestimate us. 
KARR: Yes, perhaps I do. 
JANEWAY: I'm listening 
KARR: My people are hunting themselves into extinction. Your holodeck technology might offer us an alternative, a new way of life. Instead of scattering ourselves across the quadrant in pursuit of prey, we could simulate the hunt and give ourselves a chance to rebuild our civilisation. 
JANEWAY: And confine your killing to holograms? 
KARR: With the safety protocols offline, the pursuit is just as challenging. 
JANEWAY: Oh, I understand what you're trying to do, but then why have you been torturing us? Why have you thrown my crew into one brutal simulation after another? 
KARR: I've been studying your behaviour, as I do with all my prey. But your holodecks allowed me to go further, to explore your culture, your history. I must admit, I've learned a great deal. 
JANEWAY: How so? 
KARR: Your people have faced extinction many times, but you've always managed to avoid it. You seem to recognise the need for change. 
JANEWAY: Yes. You've got one of those moments running right now on the holodeck. We called it World War Two. 
KARR: One of your most difficult eras. And yet you survived. 
JANEWAY: It wasn't easy. 
KARR: You are a resilient species. I admire your cunning. 
JANEWAY: Let's end this. I'll call a ceasefire and we can try to contain the damage. I want my ship back, but in return I will give you what you need to create the holodeck technology. It would be cunning for you to agree. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
(Turanj pours himself a glass of wine.)
TURANJ: Synthetic, and undrinkable. I am tired of this simulation. 
KAPITAN: Mein Herr, a word with you. 
TURANJ: And these holograms are becoming annoying as well. 
KAPITAN: What are we waiting for? Why don't we execute these prisoners? 
TURANJ: Orders from the Kommandant. 
KAPITAN: If I may speak freely. The Kommandant has been acting strangely the past few days. He's been questioning German superiority. Perhaps we shouldn't follow his orders so blindly. 
TURANJ: You will do as he says, as long as I tell you to. 
KAPITAN: I don't know how much longer I can stand being trapped in here. 
TURANJ: Perhaps you would enjoy some entertainment. Sing. 
SEVEN: I will not. 
TURANJ: Sing or you will die. 
SEVEN: Then I'll die. 
TUVOK: Seven, you are a valued member of this crew. The logical response would be to grant his request. 
SEVEN: Logic is irrelevant. One day the Borg will assimilate your species despite your arrogance. When that moment arrives, remember me. 
KARR [OC]: Bridge to holodeck one. 
TURANJ: Yes. 
[Bridge] 
KARR: I've come to an agreement with Captain Janeway. Call a ceasefire. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
TURANJ: What? 
TUVOK: Captain? 
JANEWAY [OC]: It's true, Tuvok. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY: Our first order of business is to call off the troops. I want you to find Chakotay 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
JANEWAY [OC]: And have him convince his soldiers to pull out of the city. 
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. 
KARR [OC]: Turanj 
[Bridge] 
KARR: Order our hunters to end the fighting. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
KAPITAN: This is madness. We're winning this battle. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
KARR [OC]: Our civilisation depends on this agreement. 
[Le Coeur de Lion] 
TURANJ: Acknowledged. You heard him, release the captives. I'll tell the others. Order all units to withdraw to these positions 
KAPITAN: I have always thought highly of you. 
TURANJ: Have you? 
KAPITAN: Yes. But the Kommandant is a fool. He doesn't understand. He's never embraced the Fuhrer or his vision. One does not cooperate with decadent forms of life. One hunts them down and eliminates them. The Kommandant speaks of civilisation. The ancient Romans were civilised. The Jews are civilised. But in all its moral decay, Rome fell to the spears of our ancestors, as the Jews are falling now. Look at our destiny. (the flag behind the bar) The field of red, the purity of German blood. The blazing white circle of the sun that sanctified that blood. No one can deny us, no power on Earth or beyond. Not the Christian Saviour, not the God of the Jews. We are driven by the very force that gives life to the universe itself. We must countermand the Kommandant's orders, stay and fight. We must be faithful to who we are. 
TURANJ: You two, follow me. 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
(Chakotay uses the field radio.)
CHAKOTAY: All units, clear the valley. Return to your previous positions. We're calling a ceasefire. Repeat, cease fire. Well, the word is out. 
TUVOK: Whether it will be acted upon is another question. 
CHAKOTAY: Oh, they'll follow orders. I'm their commanding officer, remember? 
PARIS: Keep it moving! Keep it moving! Get the lead out of your pants! 
SEVEN: Mid-twentieth century American slang. 
PARIS: You got a problem with that, sister? 
SEVEN: You're enjoying this simulation. I find that peculiar, given the circumstances. 
PARIS: Loosen up, baby doll, the war's almost over. 
(Gunfire.)
TORRES: So much for the ceasefire. 
KAPITAN: Fire! Fire! 
[Holodeck two - Klingon programme] 
EMH: I've been monitoring the other simulation, and the fighting's getting worse. The crew is taking heavy casualties. 
NEELIX: How can we help? 
EMH: I'll transfer my programme to holodeck one. You take the Jefferies tube and meet me there. 
NEELIX: There's only the two of us. 
EMH: Nevertheless we have to try and. Even half drunk, Klingons are among the best warriors in the galaxy. 
NEELIX: But they're already in the middle of a war with the house of whatever it is. 
EMH: Then you'll just have to convince them that there's a more important battle to be waged. 
NEELIX: Me? 
EMH: You are their Great Warrior. Lead them. 
NEELIX: Pardon me, gentlemen. I wonder if I might have a word with you. 
EMH: They're Klingons, not kittens.
(Neelix snatches the leg of meat from one Klingon's hand and throws it in the campfire..) 
NEELIX: You will listen! 
[Holodeck lab] 
JANEWAY: These sensors indicate you've placed holo-emitters on decks five through twelve? No wonder the system breached. You've turned Voyager into one big holodeck. 
KARR: Can you shut it down? 
JANEWAY: Yes, but I'm going to have to initiate an overload. We'll worry about making repairs later. Right now we've got to put an end to those simulations. Janeway to Ensign Kim. 
[Bridge] 
KIM: Yes, Captain. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Harry, I'm going to need your help overloading the holo-emitter network. 
[Holodeck lab] 
JANEWAY: I'm transferring optical processor control to you now. Start charging the secondary power relays. 
[Bridge] 
JANEWAY [OC]: We'll use them to trigger the overload. 
KIM: I'm on it. 
[Holodeck lab] 
JANEWAY: It's going to take some time. There are over eight hundred emitters that we have to 
(Turanj enters, armed with a rifle.)
TURANJ: Move away from the controls. 
KARR: Why haven't you ordered the ceasefire? 
(Turanj shoots his Alpha in the shoulder.)
TURANJ: Move away from the controls. 
KARR: Listen to me. 
TURANJ: No! 
(And shoots Karr again. He dies.)
JANEWAY: What are you waiting for? 
TURANJ: I am a hunter. You are my prey. Run.
(Janeway runs into the corridor. Turanj follows.) 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. Out. Our holographic allies are losing ground. The German troops are surrounding the city. 
PARIS: I don't know how much longer we can hold them off. These weapons are pretty crude. They're not much help. 
TORRES: Maybe we should fall back? 
CHAKOTAY: Where to? They're coming in from all sides. Tuvok, any chance we can get through that breach in the hologrid. 
TUVOK: Unlikely. Twenty more Hirogen have taken up position near the opening. We are outnumbered. 
CHAKOTAY: How's it going? 
SEVEN: I'm modifying this explosive device to emit a photonic burst. It will be harmless to organic tissue but it should disrupt all holographic activity within twenty metres. 
CHAKOTAY: We'll try to buy you some time.
(Janeway gets into the Jefferies tube network before Turanj catches up with her. He doubles back, feels the hatch, then opens it.) 
[Bridge] 
HIROGEN: I'll be in Sickbay. 
(Kim is left unsupervised. He does his bit on Auxilliary Systems 0470. Charging Holo-Emitters. Holo-Emitter Overload Initiated. The countdown starts at 9 minutes.) 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
NAZI: Schnell! Schell!
CHAKOTAY: They're closing in. Seven! 
(Seven pulls the pin on her modified grenade, stands to throw it and gets shot. A GI tries to get to it, then it goes off and he disappears, along with the weapons. The Nazi's weren't close enough.)
KAPITAN: Surrender. 
(Janeway limps to a place where a holographic soldier no longer has any legs. She drags him back and they reappear, and she carries on. Meanwhile, Seven is helped to her feet. Real life thunder rumbles overhead.)
KAPITAN: Verdamt. Bring that one to me. I will spare your life for now, but only because you are carrying a German child. 
[Corridor] 
(Turanj hears a noise and turns down a side corridor. Janeway is in the shadows, behind fallen debris. Turanj stands near the fallen soldier.)
JANEWAY: Please don't do this. I can be of use to you. I can help you repair the ship. Don't kill me.
(Turanj steps forward. His rifle starts to disappear, he looks down and she hits him with a metal pipe. Then she picks up the rifle and he runs away.) 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
(A firing squad is formed.)
KAPITAN: Against the wall. Your deaths will serve the glory of the Reich. Prepare to fire. 
(A swarm of Klingons burst through the barricade. The Nazi soldiers go to meet them. Turanj looks down on the melee.)
NEELIX: Fight on, warriors! This way! 
EMH: Qapla', gentlemen. Qapla'! 
(Neelix and the EMH stay under a cafe awning as the rain pours. The Kapitan knocks down Paris, then a Klingon kills him.) 
[Corridor] 
JANEWAY: This hunt is over. Tell your hunters to stand down. I'll use this if you force me to.
(Turanj steps forward. Janeway shoots him and he falls backwards into the holodeck, down three decks. Seven seconds to holo-emitter overload.) 
[Sainte Claire - Street] 
(All the holographics characters vanish.)
CHAKOTAY: It's over. Let's go. 
Captain's log, stardate 51715.2. The damage to Voyager has been extreme. Both sides have taken heavy casualties, and it's clear that no one is going to win this conflict. The fighting has reached a standstill and the remaining Hirogen have agreed to negotiate a truce. 
[Cargo Bay two] 
YOUNG HIROGEN: What is this? 
JANEWAY: An optronic datacore. You can use it to create holodeck technology on your own vessels. I made a promise with your leader before he died, that I would give this knowledge to the Hirogen. Take it. 
YOUNG HIROGEN: His ideas were unconventional. I do not share them. 
JANEWAY: Was he any more unconventional than you are? Calling a ceasefire with your prey? Only a few days ago, the thought of speaking with us on equal terms would've been inconceivable, but here we are. Accept this trophy. You can use it to create a new future for your people. At the very least, you can hang it on your bulkhead.
(She hands it to him, and he bows his head briefly. Janeway returns the gesture and the Hirogen leave Voyager to sail on alone.)
