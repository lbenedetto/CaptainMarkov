[2371 Transporter room] 
(Voyager is still under construction at Utopia Planitia. Janeway is greeted by an elderly Admiral.)
PATTERSON: You're late. 
JANEWAY: Sorry, sir. 
PATTERSON: What's the threshold of the H-two molecule? 
JANEWAY: Fourteen point seven electron volts. 
PATTERSON: Third brightest star in Orion? 
JANEWAY: Viewed from where? 
PATTERSON: Earth. 
JANEWAY: Gamma Orionis, or Bellatrix, if you prefer the original Arabic name. 
PATTERSON: Not bad. Now, give me a hug, Katie, that's an order. 
JANEWAY: I wasn't expecting a pop quiz. 
PATTERSON: Just wanted to make sure all those pips haven't made you forget you're a scientist first. 
JANEWAY: How could they? I still have nightmares about your fractal calculus final. 
[2371 Corridor] 
PATTERSON: There's still some work to be done, but once the sawdust clears, I think you'll be impressed. Voyager may not be as big as a Galaxy class ship but she's quick and smart, like her Captain. 
JANEWAY: Seven hundred thousand metric tons, fifteen decks, and computer systems augmented with bio-neural circuitry, top cruising speed warp nine point nine seven five. 
[2371 Turbolift] 
PATTERSON: Deck one. 
JANEWAY: Of course, I expect to get that up another notch or two. 
PATTERSON: Sounds like you already know your ship pretty well. 
JANEWAY: I've been buried in Voyager's schematics for the past three months. I could walk the corridors blindfolded. 
PATTERSON: You might not want to shut your eyes just yet. 
[2371 Bridge] 
PATTERSON: Captain on the bridge. 
JANEWAY: As you were. It's bigger than I expected. 
PATTERSON: Schematics never fully prepare you for the real thing. 
(She walks to the Captain's chair.)
PATTERSON: Try it on. Don't get too comfortable, I have more to show you. 
[2371 Ready room] 
PATTERSON: Your home away from home. 
JANEWAY: Coffee? 
PATTERSON: Ah, no thanks. 
JANEWAY: Coffee, black. Any word from Tuvok? 
PATTERSON: Not yet. 
JANEWAY: Shouldn't he have made contact by now? 
PATTERSON: We know he's aboard Chakotay's ship. He's probably decided not to risk exposure until he has to. 
JANEWAY: Catching up with him in the Badlands is going to be tricky, even in a ship as quick and smart as Voyager. I've heard about a pilot who might make the job easier. 
PATTERSON: Who's that? 
JANEWAY: Tom Paris. 
PATTERSON: Admiral Paris's son? Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's serving a sentence for 
JANEWAY: He's made some mistakes. But everybody deserves a second chance. 
PATTERSON: I'll look into it. 
[2371 Bridge] 
JANEWAY: If it's not too late, I'd like to recalibrate the navigational sensors. I think I can enhance the range. 
PATTERSON: Your coffee's not even cold, you're already making changes. 
JANEWAY: Excuse us, Ensign. I like a ship that knows where it's going. 
(Seven of Nine moves away from the console. She has no visible Borg implants.)
PATTERSON: I assure you, Voyager has the best sensors in the fleet. 
JANEWAY: There's always room for improvement. 
PATTERSON: I assume you've read (muffled under music) 
JANEWAY: I have. A few changes (muffled under music)
[2371 Briefing room] 
SEVEN: The bridge is clear. No sign of the weapon. 
DUCANE [OC]: Continue scanning. 
SEVEN: Acknowledged. 
PATTERSON: Your briefing room. 
JANEWAY: Starfleet's most up to date vessel and they still can't design a comfortable place to hold a meeting. What do you think, Ensign? 
SEVEN: Captain? 
JANEWAY: What's your opinion of this room? 
SEVEN: It is an efficient design. 
JANEWAY: Well, there you have it, Admiral. It's efficient. I must be wrong. Carry on. 
[2371 Sickbay] 
PATTERSON: We've added a new system we're thinking of installing throughout the fleet. 
JANEWAY: The Emergency Medical Hologram. I'm up to date. Computer, activate EMH. 
EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. 
PATTERSON: It's programmed with over four million surgical procedures. 
EMH: Five million, and the medical knowledge of over three thousand cultures. 
JANEWAY: Impressive. 
EMH: Did you call me to chitchat or is there an actual emergency? 
JANEWAY: Its personality could use some work. 
EMH: I'm designed to practice medicine as efficiently as possible. Small talk only compromises my performance. 
PATTERSON: Thank you, Doctor. Computer, deactivate EMH. 
[2371 Engineering] 
CAREY: Hello. 
SEVEN: Sir. 
CAREY: Lieutenant Carey. I don't think we've met. 
SEVEN: Jameson, Anna, Service number eight six zero seven nine zero. 
CAREY: I'm not security. I'm just trying to get to know all the new faces around here. What are you working on? 
SEVEN: I am attempting to realign the EPS manifolds. 
CAREY: Do you need a hand? 
SEVEN: No. 
CAREY: Well, maybe I'll see you in the mess hall later. 
SEVEN: Unlikely. 
CAREY: Hmm? 
SEVEN: I am not a member of Voyager's crew. I'm on assignment here at Utopia Planitia. 
CAREY: Too bad. Well, next time I'm in the neighbourhood, I'll drop by and say hello. 
[2371 Corridor] 
JANEWAY: I wish Starfleet would give me more than three weeks. With a little more time we could really explore the Badlands. 
PATTERSON: You haven't changed a bit. 
[2371 Engineering] 
PATTERSON: Main Engineering. Class nine warp drive, tricyclic input manifold. You'll be the first to test it in deep space. 
[2371 Jefferies tube] 
SEVEN: I've localised the temporal distortions. Deck four, section thirty nine. 
(She opens a panel in a junction. Her enhanced sight shows the otherwise invisible object.)
SEVEN: I've found the weapon. 
DUCANE: Begin the procedure. 
[2371 Engineering] 
JANEWAY: Problem? 
CAREY: One of the EPS relays just went offline. 
JANEWAY: Voyager's first malfunction. 
CAREY: I'm sorry, Captain. I tested those systems this morning. 
JANEWAY: As you were, Lieutenant. I've been looking forward to getting my hands dirty. 
[2371 Jefferies tube] 
SEVEN: The weapon is out of phase. You've sent me to the wrong time frame. 
DUCANE [OC]: At least we know where the weapon was placed. Now we have to determine when. 
[2371 Outside the Jefferies tube] 
JANEWAY: This hatch is locked from the inside. 
PATTERSON: This isn't a secure area. None of these hatches should be sealed. 
JANEWAY: I'm reading some kind of chronoton flux. 
PATTERSON: Chronotons? 
JANEWAY: It's coming from inside this Jefferies tube. 
PATTERSON: Patterson to Security. Seal off deck four. 
[2371 Jefferies tube] 
SEVEN: I've been detected. I must leave. 
BRAXTON [OC]: There's too much interference from the weapon. Recalibrate your temporal transport beacon. 
SEVEN: Understood. 
[2371 Corridor] 
JANEWAY: We can access section thirty nine through here. 
[2371 Jefferies tube] 
BRAXTON [OC]: Scramble the locking mechanism before they get in. Hurry, they're approaching your coordinates. You'll need to reset the command controls. 
DUCANE [OC]: Stand by. We're trying to get you out of there. 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: It's time. Pull her out. 
DUCANE: There's too much interference. If I transport her now we'll damage her bionetic implants. 
BRAXTON: If we don't, Captain Janeway's going to find her and it'll contaminate the timeline. 
DUCANE: Sir. 
BRAXTON: Now. 
CREWMAN: Temporal transport in progress. 
[2371 Jefferies tube] 
JANEWAY: Question, Admiral. What causes a chronoton flux of point zero zero three? 
PATTERSON: I don't know. 
JANEWAY: Neither do I, but whoever or whatever it was, it's gone now. 
[Relativity transporter room] 
CREWMAN: The subject is approaching the temporal threshold. 
(Seven of Nine solidifies, then collapses.)
DUCANE:I told you this was going to happen. She's dead. 
{Relativity]
BRAXTON: Any luck reviving her? 
DUCANE: No, sir. 
BRAXTON: We'll have to recruit her again. 
DUCANE: Sir, a fourth jump? She could suffer neural damage, even temporal psychosis. 
BRAXTON: Unless we repair the timeline, she's going to die. We're giving her another chance to save her crew and herself. We'll go back and retrieve Seven of Nine a microsecond before the explosion. That way no one will notice she's gone. Tempus fugit, Lieutenant. 
DUCANE: Raise shields. Time frame, stardate 52861.274. Delta Quadrant. Spatial coordinates eighty seven theta by two seventy one. Target, USS Voyager. 
[Cargo Bay two] 
(Seven's vision is slightly blurred.)
EMH: Follow the light. To the left, right, and up, and down. Hmm. 
SEVEN: I ran a complete self-diagnostic. 
EMH: Hmm hmm? 
SEVEN: At first I thought my ocular implants were malfunctioning. However, after consulting the Starfleet Medical database, I realise it is a flaw in my human physiology. 
EMH: Specifically? 
SEVEN: I'm experiencing dizziness, double vision. After considering all potential environmental and genetic factors, I've concluded I'm suffering from Albright-Salzman syndrome. 
EMH: A rare neurological condition that hasn't affected a single human being for over two centuries. Unlikely. 
SEVEN: Human physiology is imperfect, susceptible to a variety of disorders. 
EMH: True, but in this instance, we can safely say that you are suffering from a mild case of sensory aphasia. A minor disruption to your neuro-receptors. Neither rare, nor life-threatening. 
SEVEN: Apparently I was in need of a second opinion. 
EMH: That's the danger of self-diagnosis. Patients always assume the worst. This should clear it up. How do things look now? 
(Seven's vision comes back into sharp focus.)
SEVEN: Normal. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Doctor, please report to Sickbay. 
EMH: On my way. Next time your human physiology fails you, don't consult the database. Just call me. 
SEVEN: You are the database. 
EMH: With two legs and a splendid bedside manner. 
[Corridor] 
(Paris is walking along, bouncing a table tennis ball on a bat.)
SEVEN: A curious exercise. 
PARIS: Yeah. Ping-Pong. You should try it, it's a great test of hand-eye coordination. 
SEVEN: I don't require testing. 
EMH: Yeah, so the Doc tells me. A visual acuity index of ninety nine point six. You know, you'd be great at this game. Why don't you be my partner in the doubles tournament tonight? Chapman was supposed to play, but he's come down with a nasty case of space sickness. 
SEVEN: I'm busy. 
PARIS: Oh, too bad. Well, I guess I'll have to tell B'Elanna that you thought you couldn't beat her. 
SEVEN: You're attempting to appeal to my vanity. 
PARIS: Is it working? 
SEVEN: I will consider your request. 
PARIS: It's yes or no, Seven. The tournament's tonight. 
SEVEN: Yes. 
PARIS: Great. Meet me in the mess hall at nineteen hundred hours. We'll get in a little practice first. 
[Doctor's office] 
EMH: Captain, you don't look well. Come in, please. 
JANEWAY: I'm sure it's nothing serious. 
EMH: Symptoms? 
JANEWAY: Nausea, dizziness. 
EMH: It looks like a simple case of space sickness. The third one I've treated today. 
JANEWAY: That's odd. We haven't run into any turbulence. 
EMH: It's possible the inertial dampers are out of alignment. 
JANEWAY: Even so, I've been on some pretty rough rides. It's never affected me like this 
EMH: It happens to everyone. Twenty milligrams of inaprovaline should restore your space legs. 
JANEWAY: I'll check the dampers. Double check your bio-readings. See if there's another explanation. 
[Mess hall] 
(The doubles match is Paris and Seven versus Kim and Torres. Neelix is the umpire.)
PARIS: Yes! 
NEELIX: Point, server. 
PARIS: It's all in the wrist. 
TORRES: Score? 
NEELIX: Nineteen eighteen. 
PARIS: Say goodnight, Harry. 
(But the ball freezes in mid-air. Seven grabs a handy tricorder.)
KIM: What do you call that shot? 
SEVEN: I'm reading temporal distortions. 
(The ball resumes its trajectory.) 
[Astrometrics lab] 
JANEWAY: Report. 
TORRES: The temporal distortions are fracturing space-time throughout the ship. 
JANEWAY: Cause? 
TUVOK: Unknown. They appear to be emanating from deck four, section thirty nine. 
TORRES: We've already erected forcefields but they're not having much effect. If we can't find a way to stop them, they'll tear the ship apart. 
JANEWAY: How much time do we have? 
TUVOK: Two hours at most. 
JANEWAY: Go to deck four and find out what we're dealing with. Let's see if we can find a way to enhance the forcefields. 
[Sickbay] 
EMH: An injection a day keeps space sickness away. You try to be funny after treating thirty seven cases of nausea. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Sickbay. 
EMH: Go ahead. 
JANEWAY [OC]: We've found the source of our epidemic. Temporal distortions. 
EMH: I was beginning to suspect some kind of anomaly. I've designed a treatment that seems to be inhibiting the symptoms. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Keep me posted. 
EMH: Aye, Captain. 
NEELIX [OC]: Neelix to the Doctor. I've got a medical emergency in the Mess hall. Ensign Mannus is violently ill. 
EMH: On my way. Take over here. 
[Mess hall] 
NEELIX: Doctor, shall I whip you up a photonic snack? 
EMH: Where's the medical emergency? 
NEELIX: I hope you're not referring to this pot roast. 
EMH: You called me a few minutes ago. You said Ensign Mannus was ill. 
NEELIX: I did? 
EMH: Yes. 
NEELIX: Ensign Mannus is right over there. He came in an hour ago and he looks perfectly normal. 
(Then Mannus collapses.)
EMH: Acute space sickness. 
NEELIX: Good thing you were here. 
EMH: I wouldn't have been, if you hadn't. Temporal distortions. 
NEELIX: Doctor? 
EMH: This is all starting to make sense. In Sickbay, it's fifteen hundred hours forty three minutes, but in the mess hall, it's fifteen thirty six. 
NEELIX: Seven minutes earlier. 
EMH: I did get a call from you. You just haven't made it yet. 
[Ready room] 
JANEWAY: Coffee, black. (doorbell) Come in. Before you say anything, let me remind you what happens to bearers of bad news. 
CHAKOTAY: Don't kill the messenger. 
JANEWAY: Go ahead, fire. 
CHAKOTAY: It looks like these space-time fractures are growing stronger. We're detecting temporal paradoxes throughout the ship. 
JANEWAY: Paradoxes? 
CHAKOTAY: Internal chronometers show it's oh six hundred on deck nine and oh six hundred five on deck thirteen. Time's passing more quickly in some parts of the ship and slowing down in others. 
JANEWAY: Maybe that explains why this coffee tastes like it's three days old. 
CHAKOTAY: The same thing's been happening in the mess hall. Food replicated less than an hour ago is already spoiled. 
JANEWAY: I've been working on a way to enhance our containment fields, to keep the fractures from spreading, 
CHAKOTAY: I'll get a team on it right away. In the meantime, we should evacuate the affected areas. 
JANEWAY: See to it. 
CHAKOTAY: There's one other problem. 
(Several versions of Chakotay appear as he moves.)
CHAKOTAY: Turbolifts two and three are offline so we've been using the Jefferies tube. 
(And back to one person. Janeway grabs her tricorder.)
CHAKOTAY: Captain? 
JANEWAY: There's a temporal distortion intersecting this room. It's expanding. 
CHAKOTAY: Time to test your new containment fields. 
[Jefferies tube] 
TORRES: This is where they're coming from. I still can't tell what's causing them. 
(They open the correct panel.)
TORRES: What is it? 
SEVEN: A piece of technology. It's emitting temporal distortions. 
TORRES: Why can't I see it? 
SEVEN: My ocular implant can detect irregularities in space-time. 
TORRES: Torres to bridge. We've found the problem. 
[Bridge] 
TORRES [OC]: There's some kind of device in junction beta twenty eight. 
JANEWAY: Beam it off the ship 
TUVOK: I can't get a lock. 
KIM: The distortions are beginning to demolecularise the hull. Hull breach, ventral section fourteen. 
(Ducane and a Relativity crewman beam aboard.) 
KIM: Captain, I'm picking up a strange reading on deck four. 
JANEWAY: What kind of reading? 
KIM: It's a chronoton flux, point zero zero three. 
CHAKOTAY: More distortions? 
KIM: I don't think so. 
JANEWAY: Dry dock. 
KIM: Ma'am? 
JANEWAY: The first time I saw these readings was five years ago. Voyager was still in dry dock. Same readings, same location. 
KIM: What caused them? 
JANEWAY: I never found out. 
CHAKOTAY: We're losing structural integrity. 
TUVOK: Multiple breaches, all decks. Emergency systems are failing. 
CHAKOTAY: The distortions are ripping us apart. We have to abandon ship.
JANEWAY: All hands, this is the Captain. Proceed to the escape pods and abandon ship. Repeat, abandon ship. 
[Corridor] 
JANEWAY [OC]: Programme the pods for a heading of one seven eight mark four. We'll rendezvous in orbit of an M class planet at those coordinates. Repeat. All hands proceed to the escape pods and abandon ship. 
(Seven meets the two newcomers.)
SEVEN: Identify yourselves. 
DUCANE: No time. 
(He places a device on her arm and they are beamed away. Voyager goes KaBOOM!) 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: Welcome back. 
SEVEN: Why have you brought me here? 
BRAXTON: For some reason, I always think you'll remember. I'm Captain Braxton. This is Lieutenant Ducane. You're aboard the Federation Timeship Relativity. 
SEVEN: I'm no longer in the twenty fourth century? 
BRAXTON: No. For you, it's almost five hundred years later. We've brought you here to help us solve a mystery. Someone, we don't know who, has planted a weapon aboard Voyager. It's designed to fracture space-time within a radius of one hundred and fifty metres. 
SEVEN: Why do you need me? 
DUCANE: Your ocular implant. It can detect disruptions in space-time better than our sensors. 
BRAXTON: You're more familiar with Voyager and her crew, less likely to arouse suspicion. So far, you've been quite useful. 
SEVEN: So far? 
BRAXTON: We've recruited you twice before for this mission. Take a look. A force three temporal disrupter. Your previous attempts to disable it have been unsuccessful. 
DUCANE: We're trying to catch the saboteur before he places the weapon on Voyager. 
SEVEN: Do you have a suspect? 
DUCANE: Not yet. 
SEVEN: Do you know when the device was placed? 
DUCANE: Not precisely, but we've narrowed the window to a period two years before you joined the crew, when the ship was under attack. 
SEVEN: Species three two nine, the Kazon. 
DUCANE: Our database indicates Voyager was boarded twice during that period. 
SEVEN: The Kazon are an inferior species. They don't possess the technology to create such a complex weapon. 
DUCANE: We believe the saboteur infiltrated this time frame because Voyager's shields were down. It was the perfect opportunity to evade the detection. 
SEVEN: If I fail, you will recruit me again. 
BRAXTON: If necessary. This'll be the third time you're going to be removed from your time frame. If we do it a fourth, there could be certain side effects. 
SEVEN: Side effects? 
DUCANE: You might experience sensory aphasia. It affects the cerebral cortex and can lead to temporal psychosis. 
BRAXTON: But in your case we're hoping third time's a charm, eh? 
SEVEN: I'll do my best. 
BRAXTON: Bring her up to date on our protocols. 
DUCANE: Aye, sir. 
BRAXTON: When you're finished here, meet me in holomatrix one. I've prepared a simulation. 
(Later.)
DUCANE: Let's see how much you've assimilated. The Dali paradox. 
SEVEN: Also known as the Melting Clock Effect. It refers to a temporal fissure which slows the passage of time to a gradual halt. 
DUCANE: The Pogo Paradox. 
SEVEN: A causality loop in which interference to prevent an event actually triggers the same event. 
DUCANE: Excellent. Can you give me an example? 
SEVEN: The Borg once travelled back in time to stop Zefram Cochrane from breaking the warp barrier. They succeeded, but that in turn led the starship Enterprise to intervene. They assisted Cochrane with the flight the Borg was trying to prevent. Causal loop complete. 
DUCANE: So, in a way, the Federation owes its existence to the Borg. 
SEVEN: You're welcome. The Seven of Nine paradox. 
DUCANE: I beg your pardon? 
SEVEN: How we do know that my presence on Voyager will not alter the timeline? 
DUCANE: You know, you've asked me this every time. 
SEVEN: What's been your response? 
DUCANE: That uncertainty is part of the equation. We don't know what's going to happen. 
SEVEN: I don't enjoy uncertainty. 
DUCANE: Neither do I. But I trust Captain Braxton's instincts, just as you trust Captain Janeway's. 
[Relativity Holomatrix] 
(Seven is now in Starfleet uniform.)
BRAXTON: This is a simulation of junction forty nine on Voyager's fourth deck. Thanks to you, we've learned that the temporal disrupter was, and will be, concealed here. I gave up trying to keep my tenses straight years ago. 
SEVEN: How will I disarm it? 
BRAXTON: You've already tried, unsuccessfully. The weapon's out of phase. You'll have to find the saboteur before he plants it. This will detect any chronoton flux other than your own, and I'm authorising you to use whatever force may be necessary.
SEVEN: Understood. 
BRAXTON: One more thing. Watch out for the Janeway Factor. 
SEVEN: I am not familiar with that protocol. 
BRAXTON: Your Captain has a knack for sticking her nose where it doesn't belong, especially when it comes to time travel. 
SEVEN: Captain Janeway is quite resourceful. Has it occurred to you that she may be helpful? 
BRAXTON: Helpful? That woman has been responsible for three major temporal incursions. 
SEVEN: No doubt creating numerous paradoxes. 
BRAXTON: And who do you think had to repair the damage? Me. She's reckless. She has no regard for the integrity of the timeline. I asked for her help once. She refused and I ended up stranded in the late twentieth century. Have you ever been to that time frame? 
SEVEN: No. 
BRAXTON: Well, I don't recommend it. After three decades with those post-industrial barbarians I had to go through extensive rehabilitation before I could return to duty. Avoid contact with Janeway. That's an order. 
SEVEN: Yes, sir. 
[Relativity] 
DUCANE: This will occlude your Borg implants. Ready? 
SEVEN: Yes. 
BRAXTON: We have a saying in our line of work. There's no time like the past. 
DUCANE: Raise shields. Time frame, stardate 49123.5621. Delta quadrant. Spatial coordinates, twenty one alpha prime by nine three six zeta. Target, USS Voyager. 
[2372 Corridor] 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: All hands to battle stations. We're under attack. Repeat, all hands to battle stations.
(Seven is beamed in after some crew run past armed with rifles.) 
[2372 Bridge] 
JANEWAY: Return fire. 
PARIS: Dropping spatial charges. 
JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres. 
TUVOK: Shields down to twenty percent. 
CHAKOTAY: Another Kazon ship is approaching. 
[2372 Engineering] 
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Engineering. We need warp engines. 
TORRES: I can't give them to you. Not until I've repaired the containment generator. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Time? 
TORRES: I'll need ten minutes at least. 
[2372 Bridge] 
KIM: Captain, I'm picking up a strange reading on deck four. 
JANEWAY: What kind of reading? 
KIM: It's a chronoton flux, point zero zero three. 
CHAKOTAY: Any idea what's causing it? 
KIM: Not yet. 
TUVOK: It could be random interference from Kazon weapons fire. 
JANEWAY: I don't think so. I've seen these readings before. 
[2372 Jefferies tube] 
(Seven opens the panel.)
SEVEN: There's no sign of the weapon. 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: Any uninvited guests? 
[2372 Jefferies tube] 
SEVEN: Not yet. 
[Bridge] 
TUVOK: The lead vessel's been disabled. The others are regrouping. 
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, status. 
TORRES [OC]: Warp drive's online, but the containment field's still unstable. Warp two is the best I can give you. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll take it. Engage. 
PARIS: They're not pursuing. 
JANEWAY: Dry dock. 
KIM: Ma'am? 
JANEWAY: The first time I saw these readings was over two years ago when Voyager was in dry dock. Same readings, same location. 
KIM: What caused them? 
JANEWAY: I never found out. The signal vanished before we could isolate it. Erect a level ten forcefield around that section. 
CHAKOTAY: Is this really the time to be chasing sensor ghosts? 
JANEWAY: Something tells me this is more than a coincidence. Seal off deck four. Tuvok, you're with me. 
[2372 Jefferies tube] 
SEVEN: They've erected forcefields around my location. I may have been detected. How shall I proceed? Lieutenant, respond. 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: What's wrong? 
DUCANE: The forcefields are blocking our transmissions. 
BRAXTON: Compensate. Seven of Nine, report. 
SEVEN [OC]: Relativity, are you there? 
DUCANE: It's no use, sir. She can't hear us. 
[2372 Corridor] 
(Seven walks into a forcefield either side of the Jefferies tube access junction..)
JANEWAY: I don't believe we've been introduced, Ensign. 
SEVEN: Lower the forcefield. 
JANEWAY: I stand corrected. We have met. Utopia 
[Relativity] 
JANEWAY [OC]: Planitia, the briefing room. You told me it 
[2372 Corridor] 
JANEWAY: Was efficient. 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: Janeway. 
SEVEN [OC]: You've 
[2372 Corridor] 
SEVEN: Mistaken me for someone else. 
JANEWAY: Oh, I don't think so. 
[Relativity] 
JANEWAY [OC]: So, here you are, two years later 
[2372 Corridor] 
JANEWAY: On the other side of the galaxy. Imagine that. 
SEVEN: You're preventing me from completing a vital mission. 
JANEWAY: Who are you, and what are you doing on my ship? 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: Don't say anything 
DUCANE: She can't hear you, sir. 
SEVEN [OC]: My designation is irrelevant, But I assure you I have no hostile 
[2372 Corridor] 
SEVEN: Intentions. 
JANEWAY: Somehow, I don't find that very comforting. Are you working with the Kazon? 
SEVEN: No, I am not. 
TUVOK: I'm detecting biomechanical implants. They have a Borg signature. 
JANEWAY: Janeway to the bridge. Scan the vicinity for Borg ships. 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Did you say Borg? 
JANEWAY: Do it. 
SEVEN: You will find none. 
JANEWAY: Then how did you get here? 
SEVEN: I'm no longer Borg. 
JANEWAY: Then who are you? 
SEVEN: I can't answer your questions. 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: Good. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Why not? 
[2372 Corridor] 
SEVEN: It would be a violation of the Temporal Prime Directive. 
JANEWAY: You're from another time? 
SEVEN: Yes. 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: No. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Who sent you? 
[2372 Corridor] 
SEVEN: I can't tell you that. I would be risking damage to the timeline. 
JANEWAY: I don't care if history itself comes unravelled, I want to know 
[Relativity] 
JANEWAY [OC]: Why you're on my ship. 
[2372 Corridor] 
(Seven's tricorder beeps.)
TUVOK: What's that? 
SEVEN: You must release me. 
TUVOK: Why? 
SEVEN: Voyager is in grave danger. 
JANEWAY: So we've noticed. 
SEVEN: Not from the Kazon. From an act of sabotage. I've been sent here to stop it. The intruder has already boarded the ship. Please, your lives depend on it. 
JANEWAY: You're not going anywhere until you tell me what's happening. 
SEVEN: My name is Seven of Nine. I'm a member of your crew. Rather, I will be a member of your crew. 
[Relativity] 
SEVEN [OC]: I've travelled back in time to try to prevent a disaster that will destroy Voyager. 
BRAXTON: Get her out of there. 
DUCANE: I'm trying. 
[2372 Corridor] 
JANEWAY: Let's see if I've got this straight. You're a Borg drone attempting to prevent a disaster that won't occur for another three years?
SEVEN: Three years six months and two days. 
JANEWAY: Does this make any sense to you? 
TUVOK: Like most time paradoxes, it's implausible, but not necessarily illogical. 
SEVEN: Captain, when you take me from the Borg you are going to tell me that part of being human is learning to trust. Trust me now. 
JANEWAY: Lower the forcefield. 
SEVEN: Seven of Nine to Braxton. Respond. 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: Stay where you are. We're pulling you out. 
SEVEN [OC]: That would be unwise. I am pursuing the saboteur 
[2372 Corridor] 
SEVEN: With Captain Janeway's assistance. 
[Relativity] 
DUCANE: Tempus fugit. 
BRAXTON: Proceed. 
[2372 Corridor] 
SEVEN: Yes, sir. The intruder is in junction fifty two beta. 
JANEWAY: Take the starboard hatch. 
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. 
[Jefferies tube] 
(They discover the saboteur, dressed in a Starfleet uniform.)
SEVEN: Captain Braxton. Lower the temporal disruptor. 
BRAXTON: It's armed. I'll activate it. Lower your weapons. 
(Janeway nods, and they do.)
BRAXTON: Janeway. 
JANEWAY: Have we met? 
BRAXTON: Too many times, but you wouldn't remember. They haven't occurred yet. 
BRAXTON [OC]: Seven of Nine, report. 
SEVEN: I have located the saboteur. 
BRAXTON [OC]: Who is it? 
SEVEN: It's you, 
[Relativity] 
SEVEN [OC]: Captain Braxton. 
BRAXTON: Me? 
[2372 Jefferies tube] 
BRAXTON: More accurately, a future you. 
[Relativity] 
FUTURE BRAXTON [OC]: Now let me complete our mission. 
BRAXTON: Our mission? I don't know what you're talking about. 
FUTURE BRAXTON [OC]: Listen 
[2372 Jefferies tube] 
BRAXTON: very carefully. The circumstances of your life are going to change in the next few years. You'll be sent into rehabilitation again, forced to retire, and it's all because of Voyager. 
SEVEN: Captain, I believe your future self is suffering from temporal psychosis. 
BRAXTON: Well of course I am, you pedantic drone. The only way for me, for us, to recover is to obliterate Voyager from the timeline. That way, none of the events that caused this illness will have occurred. 
JANEWAY: What events? 
BRAXTON: Thirty years of exile on twentieth century Earth. The temporal inversion in the Takara sector. Three violations that I had to repair. 
[Relativity] 
BRAXTON: Can you get a lock on him? 
DUCANE: Negative. He's activated a dispersal node. I should say, you've activated a dispersal node. 
BRAXTON: Don't be absurd. I have no wish to sabotage Voyager. 
DUCANE: Not yet. 
BRAXTON: Remodulate the transporters. Find a way to cut through the interference. I gave you an order, Lieutenant. 
DUCANE: I'm sorry, sir. I'm taking command of this vessel, and I'm relieving you of duty for crimes you're going to commit. 
BRAXTON: I haven't done anything. 
DUCANE: Seven of Nine 
[2372 Jefferies tube] 
DUCANE [OC]: Apprehend Braxton. 
(Tuvok opens the hatch behind Braxton.)
BRAXTON: No. 
(Braxton beams himself away with the device.)
SEVEN: Relativity, he's escaped. 
[Relativity] 
DUCANE: I'm tracking him. He's travelled to another time frame, two years earlier. 
SEVEN [OC]: Transport me to those coordinates. 
DUCANE: That would be your fourth jump. 
SEVEN [OC]: I am aware of the risks. 
DUCANE: Stand by. 
[2372 Jefferies tube] 
SEVEN: Thank you for your assistance. 
[2371 Corridor] 
(Seven is beamed in, and staggers briefly.)
PATTERSON: There's still some work to be done but, er, once the sawdust clears I think you'll be impressed. Voyager may not be as big as a Galaxy class ship but she's quick 
(Janeway pulls Patterson aside as Braxton runs through.)
SEVEN: Take cover! 
(Seven fires and misses.)
JANEWAY: Security, report to deck four, section twelve. Erect forcefields around all access points. Is this part of the tour? 
(Braxton runs into a forcefield. Seven can see him, but she is not well. He beams himself away.) 
[Relativity] 
SEVEN [OC]: I've lost him. 
DUCANE: He's still on Voyager 
[2371 Corridor] 
DUCANE [OC]: But he's gone five years ahead. 
SEVEN: Initiate transport. 
(Seven is beamed away as Janeway and Patterson arrive.) 
[Mess hall] 
PARIS: Yes! 
NEELIX: Point, server. 
PARIS: It's all in the wrist. 
TORRES: Score? 
NEELIX: Nineteen eighteen. 
(Braxton runs in.)
PARIS: Who are you? 
(Future Seven staggers in and shoots Braxton.) 
PARIS: Bridge, intruder alert, deck two. 
(Braxton staggers, then she shoots his tricorder out of his hand before collapsing against the wall. Braxton grabs his tricorder and runs out.)
SEVEN: Explain. 
FUTURE SEVEN: No time. You must apprehend him. He's trying to destroy Voyager. 
DUCANE [OC]: Seven of Nine, status. 
FUTURE SEVEN: I am incapacitated. It's sensory aphasia. 
DUCANE [OC]: Stand by. 
[Relativity] 
DUCANE: I'm pulling you out. 
[Mess hall] 
FUTURE SEVEN: Stop him. Your future depends on it. 
(She is beamed away.) 
[Relativity Bridge] 
DUCANE: Braxton? 
SEVEN: I disabled his tricorder. He's trapped there. Seven of Nine is pursuing him. She is efficient. She will succeed. 
DUCANE: Let's hope so, because we've run out of options. 
[Corridor] 
(Braxton is cornered by Janeway, Security, and Seven. Seven takes the temporal disrupter and disables it.)
BRAXTON: You again! 
JANEWAY: I don't believe we've met, Ensign. No, I'm wrong, we have met. Captain Braxton. 
BRAXTON: Not anymore. I've lost my rank thanks to you. 
FUTURE SEVEN [OC]: Seven of Nine to Seven of Nine. What's your status? 
SEVEN: We've apprehended Braxton. How shall we proceed? 
FUTURE SEVEN [OC]: Stand by. 
[Relativity Transporter pad] 
(They beam the saboteur aboard.)
BRAXTON: Long time no see. 
[Corridor] 
JANEWAY: Are you all right, Seven? 
SEVEN: I believe we've just prevented Voyager's destruction. 
JANEWAY: Would you care to explain how you
(Janeway is beamed away.) 
[Relativity] 
JANEWAY: The Timeship Relativity. 
SEVEN: We need your help. 
DUCANE: This Seven of Nine stopped Braxton, but she created several temporal incursions along the way. She instigated a phaser fight at Utopia Planitia. She was seen by you and Lieutenant Tuvok two years before she joined your crew. And she interacted with her past self in front of fifteen crew members at a Ping-Pong tournament approximately six minutes ago. Your time frame, of course. 
JANEWAY: Of course. 
DUCANE: Needless to say, we need to clean up the timeline. Someone must go back to the beginning and prevent the chain of events from occurring in the first place. 
SEVEN: I can't make another jump without damaging myself. 
JANEWAY: I get the feeling I'm about to be drafted. 
DUCANE: In exchange for leniency, Captain Braxton informed us of the precise moment he boarded Voyager to plant the weapon. We'll be sending you to stop him. Tell her. 
BRAXTON: Deck four, section thirty eight. I'll stumble over a wounded crewmember. That will be your chance to capture me. 
DUCANE: Don't miss it, or we'll have to do this all over again. 
JANEWAY: Wait a minute, let me get this straight. I'm going back in time to stop Braxton. But you already have him. 
DUCANE: And there's a third one in our brig. I arrested him earlier today. But, don't worry. They'll all be reintegrated in time for the trial. 
JANEWAY: And Seven? 
DUCANE: Oh, I assure you, when all this is over there'll be just one Seven of Nine. 
JANEWAY: All right. Let's get started before my headache gets any worse. 
[2372 Corridor] 
(Torres runs up to short-haired Janeway.)
TORRES: Captain, a Kazon torpedo just blew out the containment generator. Do you want me to reroute emergency power or take the warp core offline? 
JANEWAY: Use your best judgment. 
TORRES: I thought you were on your way to the bridge. 
JANEWAY: I have to take care of something first. Now get moving, Lieutenant. 
(She reaches the place where a crewman is lying in the corridor, and hides.)
PAST JANEWAY: Send damage control teams to decks nine through fourteen. Seal the breaches if you can. I'll be on the Bridge. Keep me informed. 
(Bun of Steel Janeway marches past.)
CREWWOMAN: Yes, ma'am. 
(Braxton beams in. A Kazon weapons hit to Voyager makes him stagger. His foot catches the crewman's elbow and he falls to his knees.)
BRAXTON: Oh! 
(Janeway grabs him, phaser to his throat.)
JANEWAY: Come here often? 
[Relativity] 
DUCANE: Incursion factor point zero zero three six. It's better than I expected. 
JANEWAY: Glad we could lend a hand. When do we go home? 
DUCANE: You'll both be returned to your time frame. You'll be reintegrated with the other Seven of Nine. Since none of your time jumps were to your foreseeable future, only the past, I see no reason to resequence your memory engrams. But remember the Temporal Prime Directive. Discuss your experiences with no one. 
JANEWAY: Understood. 
DUCANE: Oh, Captain. Braxton was right about one thing. Voyager shows up on our sensors far too often. Try to avoid time travel. 
JANEWAY: See you in the twenty fourth century. 
SEVEN: I look forward to it, or should I say, backward? 
JANEWAY: Don't get started.
