KIRK: We should have intercepted by now. The Bridge said they'd call.#
KIRK: Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Certain you don't know what irritation is?#
KIRK: Terrible having bad blood like that. KELSO  Bridge to briefing lounge. Object is now within tractor beam range. KIRK: No visual contact, Mister Kelso?#
KIRK: Lock onto it, Mister Kelso.#
KIRK: Bring it aboard. Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected when something threatened the ship.#
KIRK: Let's hope its tapes are intact. We'll feed it through Mister Spock's computer.#
KIRK: Flash the Bridge. Put all decks on the alert.#
KIRK: Getting into shape?#
KIRK: Screen on.#
KIRK: Neutralise warp, Mister Mitchell. Hold this position.#
KIRK: Address intercraft.#
KIRK: This is the Captain speaking. The object we encountered is a ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S.S. Valiant two hundred years ago.#
KIRK: We hope to learn from the recorder what the Valiant was doing here and what destroyed the vessel. We'll move out into our probe as soon as we have those answers. All decks, stand by.#
KIRK: The old impulse engines weren't strong enough.#
KIRK: Extrasensory perception. Doctor Dehner, how are you on ESP?#
KIRK: I'm asking what you know about ESP.#
KIRK: Comments?#
KIRK: That's probably the best argument to continue the probe. Other vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what they'll be facing. We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell. Ahead, warp factor one.#
KIRK: Gravitation on automatic.  Emergency stations. All decks on fire alert. Neutralise controls. Kelso, put it on manual. Any radiation? Anything?#
KIRK: Helmsmen, take us out of here. (Dehner gets hit by an electric charge, then Mitchell) Helmsmen!  Lateral power! Take damage reports.#
KIRK: Gary. Gary, are you all right?#
KIRK: And you, are you feeling all right?#
KIRK: You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of extrasensory perception. So do the records of the others. Gary Mitchell has the highest esper rating of all.#
KIRK: Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind?#
KIRK: I've been worried about you ever since that night on Deneb IV.#
KIRK: Do you feel any different?#
KIRK: How?#
KIRK: I wasn't that bad, was I?#
KIRK: You what? You planned that?#
KIRK: I almost married her!#
KIRK: You? Spinoza?#
KIRK: Go on.#
KIRK: I'm going to ask Doctor Dehner to keep you under observation for a while.#
KIRK: Consider it a challenge.#
KIRK: Put a twenty four hour watch on the Sickbay. Fullest possible range of examinations and tests.#
KIRK: That's enough, Doctor.#
KIRK: It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to see I'm provided with that. Go ahead, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, would you repeat what you just told us?#
KIRK: Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude?#
KIRK: And you didn't think it worth mentioning?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: There'll be no discussion of this with the crew. Thank you.#
KIRK: I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings.#
KIRK: And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there. We haven't enough power to blast back out.#
KIRK: If you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it. That station is fully automated. There's not a soul on the whole planet. Even the ore ships call only once every twenty years.#
KIRK: Get out of here.#
KIRK: Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got a heart. We're talking about Gary.#
KIRK: Set course for Delta Vega. Star date 1313.1. We're now approaching Delta Vega. Course set for a standard orbit. This planet, completely uninhabited, is slightly smaller than Earth. Desolate, but rich in crystal and minerals. Kelso's task, transport down with a repair party, try to regenerate the main engines, save the ship. Our task, transport down a man I've known for fifteen years, and if we're successful, maroon him there.#
KIRK: Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary?#
KIRK: What would you do in my place?#
KIRK: I want him unconscious for a while.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Can you do it, Lee?#
KIRK: Take him.#
KIRK: Nobody but us chickens, Doctor.#
KIRK: The fuel bins, Lee. Could they be detonated from here?#
KIRK: Do it.#
KIRK: Doctor Piper. I want only one medical officer here at any one time. The other will monitor him on the dispensary screen.#
KIRK: And almost died. I remember.#
KIRK: You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise. In the transporter room, you said something about us seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us if we got in your way.#
KIRK: Yes. In the Sickbay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill a mutant like yourself.#
KIRK: Gary. Gary, don't!#
KIRK: His eyes went back to normal.#
KIRK: I didn't order any  Affirmative. Landing party out.#
KIRK: Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?#
KIRK: If Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if sitting here, you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button. Captain's log, Star date 1313.3. Note commendations on Lieutenant Kelso and the engineering staff. In orbit above us, the engines of the Enterprise are almost fully regenerated. Balance of the landing party is being transported back up. Mitchell, whatever he's become, keeps changing, growing stronger by the minute.#
KIRK: Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso. We'll all transport up together.#
KIRK: Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute. I think he knows that.#
KIRK: You're leaving with the ship, Doctor.#
KIRK: I gave you an order, Doctor.#
KIRK: Doctor Dehner?#
KIRK: Don't give him a pill until after I'm gone. It's my fault Mitchell got as far as he did. Did you see their direction?#
KIRK: When Mister Spock recovers, you'll both transport up immediately to the Enterprise.#
KIRK: If you have not received a signal from me within twelve hours, you'll proceed at maximum warp to the nearest Earth base with my recommendation that this entire planet be subjected to a lethal concentration of neutron radiation. No protest on this, Mark. That's an order.#
KIRK: You must help me Before it goes too far.#
KIRK: And for humanity? You're still human#
KIRK: At least partly, you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me.#
KIRK: What will Mitchell learn in getting there? Will he know what to do with his power? Will he acquire the wisdom?#
KIRK: Did you hear him joke about compassion? Above all else, a god needs compassion. Mitchell! Elizabeth.#
KIRK: Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties. As powerful as he gets, he'll have all that inside him.#
KIRK: You were a psychiatrist once. You know the ugly, savage things we all keep buried, that none of us dare expose. But he'll dare. Who's to stop him? He doesn't need to care. Be a psychiatrist for one minute longer. What do you see happening to him? What's your prognosis, Doctor?#
KIRK: Then watch him. Hang on to being a human for one minute longer.#
KIRK: A god, but still driven by human frailty. Do you like what you see?#
KIRK: To you? Not to both of you?#
KIRK: There'll only be one of you in the end. One jealous god. if all this makes a god, or is it making you something else?#
KIRK: Do you like what you see? Absolute power corrupting absolutely. (Dehner zaps Mitchell, he returns fire, she continues and his eyes return to normal)#
KIRK: Gary, forgive me.#
KIRK: Enterprise from Captain Kirk, come in.#
KIRK: Captain's log, Star date 1313.8. Add to official losses, Doctor Elizabeth Dehner. Be it noted she gave her life in performance of her duty. Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, same notation. I want his service record to end that way. He didn't ask for what happened to him.#
KIRK: I believe there's some hope for you after all, Mister Spock.#
KIRK:  Just a few seconds more.#
KIRK: You're killing me. You're killing me.#
KIRK: You'd be the last one I'd tell. (sees light, goes to desk monitor) Kirk here. What's going on?#
KIRK: What's that?#
KIRK: A vessel of some kind?#
KIRK: I'll be right up. You could see the alarm lights flashing from there, McCoy. Why didn't you tell me?#
KIRK: Bridge. Captain to Bridge.#
KIRK: Any changes?#
KIRK: Any indication of danger from it?#
KIRK: I'll change first then. Captain out.#
KIRK: Captain to Bridge.#
KIRK: Any signs of life?#
KIRK: Have you tried all hailing frequencies?#
KIRK: Have the department heads meet me on the Bridge.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura.#
KIRK: Navigation.#
KIRK: Scotty.#
KIRK: I'll buy speculation.#
KIRK: Life sciences.#
KIRK: I'll keep that in mind, Mister Bailey, when this becomes a democracy. Captain's Log, star date 1513.8. Star maps reveal no indication of habitable planets nearby. Origin and purpose of the cube still unknown. We've been here, held motionless, for eighteen hours.#
KIRK: Anything further, gentlemen?#
KIRK: Second?#
KIRK: And you don't recommend sticking around.#
KIRK: It's time for action, gentlemen. Mister Bailey#
KIRK: Countermand. I'll select what kind of action.#
KIRK: Are you explaining Mister Bailey? I haven't requested an explanation. Now, as I was about to say, Navigator, plot us a spiral course away from the cube.#
KIRK: Engage, Mister Sulu. Quarter speed.#
KIRK: Let's see if it'll give way. Ahead half speed.#
KIRK: All stop. Hold position.#
KIRK: Power astern, half speed.#
KIRK: Engines astern, full speed.#
KIRK: Helm, give us warp speed.#
KIRK: Phaser Crew stand ready.#
KIRK: Lock phasers on target. Mister Bailey, lock phasers.#
KIRK: Fire main phasers. Captain's Log, star date 1514.0. The cube has been destroyed. Ship's damage minor but my next decision, major. Probe on ahead or turn back.#
KIRK: Care to speculate on what we'll find if we go on ahead?#
KIRK: Intelligence different from ours or superior?#
KIRK: No, I'm not. The mission of the Enterprise is to seek out and contact alien life.#
KIRK: It gives me emotional security. Navigator, set a course ahead.#
KIRK: Engage.#
KIRK: Mister Bailey, phaser crews were sluggish. You were slow in locking them into your directional beam. Helmsman, engineering decks could have been faster, too. Programme a series of simulated attacks and evasion maneuvers. Keep repeating the exercise until we're proficient, gentlemen.#
KIRK: Captain's quarters. Aren't you the one who always says a little suffering is good for the soul?#
KIRK: I think he'll cut it.#
KIRK: Why, Doctor, you've been reading your textbooks again?#
KIRK: What's next? They're not machines, Jim?#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I've heard you say that man is ultimately superior to any mechanical device.#
KIRK: I could've sworn I heard you say that. Kirk here.#
KIRK: Let's try for one hundred, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I'm going to take it, and I'm going to#
KIRK: What the devil is this? Green leaves?#
KIRK: Will you stop hovering over me, Yeoman?#
KIRK: Bring some for the doctor, too.#
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman.#
KIRK: When I find the headquarters genius that assigned me a female yeoman#
KIRK: I've already got a female to worry about. Her name's the Enterprise.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Coming.#
KIRK: Half speed. Prepare for evasive action.#
KIRK: All engines stop.#
KIRK: Phaser crews stand ready.#
KIRK: What's its mass, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Reduce image. Let me see all of it.#
KIRK: Ship to ship.#
KIRK: This is the United Earth ship Enterprise. We convey greetings and await your reply. What is it, Mister Bailey?#
KIRK: Pick it up.#
KIRK: Ship to ship.#
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. The warning nature of your space buoy was unknown to us. Our vessel was blocked. When we attempted to disengage#
KIRK: Does the recorder marker have this on its tapes?#
KIRK: Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker. Mister Bailey?#
KIRK: Captain to crew. Those of you who have served for long on this vessel have encountered alien lifeforms. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, an irrational fear of the unknown. But there's no such thing as the unknown, only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood. In most cases we have found that intelligence capable of a civilisation is capable of understanding peaceful gestures. Surely a lifeform advanced enough for space travel is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives. All decks stand by. Captain out. Ship to ship.#
KIRK: This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise. We came seeking friendship but we have no wish to trespass. To demonstrate our goodwill, our vessel will now return the way it came. We (humming noise) Lay in a course ahead, Mister Bailey.#
KIRK: Engage, warp factor one.#
KIRK: Switch to impulse.#
KIRK: Yes, of course you were.#
KIRK: They want us to lose our heads.#
KIRK: Bailey, you're relieved! Escort him to his quarters, Doctor.#
KIRK: Ship to ship.#
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. It is the custom of Earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible. We destroyed your space buoy as a simple act of self-preservation. When we attempted to move away from it, it emitted radiation harmful to our species. If you've examined our ship and its tapes, you know this to be true.#
KIRK: What's the matter with them out there? They must know we mean them no harm.#
KIRK: There must be something to do, something I've overlooked.#
KIRK: Is that your best recommendation?#
KIRK: Nobody's given up yet.#
KIRK: That's my decision, Doctor.#
KIRK: I'm ordering you to drop it. I have no time for you, your theories, your quaint philosophies.#
KIRK: Any time you can bluff me, Doctor.#
KIRK: All right, Doctor. Let's hope we have time to argue about it. Not chess, Mister Spock, poker. Do you know the game? Ship to ship.#
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise. Our respect for other lifeforms requires that we give you this warning. One critical item of information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of any Earth ship. Since the early years of space exploration, Earth vessels have had incorporated into them a substance known as corbomite. It is a material and a device which prevents attack on us. If any destructive energy touches our vessel, a reverse reaction of equal strength is created, destroying#
KIRK: Destroying the attacker! It may interest you to know that since the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago, no attacking vessel has survived the attempt. Death has little meaning to us. If it has none to you then attack us now. We grow annoyed at your foolishness.#
KIRK: Doc. Sorry.#
KIRK: Permission granted.#
KIRK: It does have advantages over chess.#
KIRK: Here it comes. Is it raise or call?#
KIRK: Hold on that. Let him sweat for a change. Ship to ship.#
KIRK: Request denied.#
KIRK: It's a small ship.#
KIRK: I want a right angled course. Shear away from him no matter which way he turns.#
KIRK: Maximum acceleration when I give the word.#
KIRK: Engage.#
KIRK: More power.#
KIRK: Shear away, Mister Bailey.#
KIRK: Now, Mister Sulu. Impulse power two.#
KIRK: All engines stop.#
KIRK: Then we're not home yet.#
KIRK: Any reply?#
KIRK: Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey.#
KIRK: Dead ahead. This is the Captain speaking. First Federation vessel is in distress. We're preparing to board it. There are lives at stake. By our standards, alien life but lives nevertheless. Captain out.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, ready the transporter room.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres. Ahead slow.#
KIRK: What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor? To seek out and contact alien life, and an opportunity to demonstrate what our high-sounding words mean. Any questions? I'll take two men with me. Doctor McCoy to examine and treat the aliens if necessary, and you, Mister Bailey.#
KIRK: The face of the unknown. I think I owe you a look at it.#
KIRK: Denied. If I'm wrong, if it's a trap, I want you here.#
KIRK: Transporter ready?#
KIRK: Air sample?#
KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. Ready, Doctor?#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: It's a dummy. A puppet of some kind.#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: Commander Balok.#
KIRK: Commander, that puppet.#
KIRK: I see.#
KIRK: But you probed our memory banks.#
KIRK: Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can find a volunteer, Mister Bailey?#
KIRK: But you'd find out more about us that way, and I'd get a better officer in return.#
KIRK: Don't lose him, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Earth ship, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Stay with him, Mister Sulu. Communication?#
KIRK: He's receiving us alright.#
KIRK: Deflectors on, Mister Farrell.#
KIRK: Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them.#
KIRK: Try to warn him. If he loses power now#
KIRK: Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell. Scotty, Spock, stand by in the transporter room.#
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room. If you don't start beaming that crew over soon#
KIRK: Scotty, we're getting a distress signal.#
KIRK: Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard?#
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room.#
KIRK: Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell. Save the power.#
KIRK: I want him there whether he can walk or not. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Come.#
KIRK: Good. Now, if you don't mind telling#
KIRK: And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain?#
KIRK: Your name, please.#
KIRK: Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions. Mister Spock will supply you with any legal information you may need for your defence.#
KIRK: And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each other. Security! Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters. Confine him there.#
KIRK: Well, switch to by-pass circuits.#
KIRK: If it makes you feel better, Engineer, that's one jackass we're going to see skinned.#
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Location and distance.#
KIRK: Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: This hearing is convened. Stardate 1329.2, on board starship U.S.S. Enterprise. Formal hearings against transport captain Leo Walsh. Start computer.#
KIRK: Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation.#
KIRK: You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's license.#
KIRK: Destination and purpose of journey?#
KIRK: Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what?#
KIRK: Data on witnesses.#
KIRK: Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings?#
KIRK: Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record.#
KIRK: Did these ladies come voluntarily?#
KIRK: The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a vessel. Do you have any defence to offer?#
KIRK: The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity.#
KIRK: Miss McHuron, if you don't mind#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Miss McHuron, would you mind. Mister Spock, will you contact the miners on Rigel 12? Notify them that we'll need the lithium crystals immediately upon arrival.#
KIRK: As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do.#
KIRK: Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the ladies with you, its, er#
KIRK: Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron#
KIRK: Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is.#
KIRK: Neither have I.#
KIRK: Miss McHuron, I don't#
KIRK: I asked for a preorbital course, Mister Farrell.#
KIRK: That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen. We're down to battery power, and we're low on that.#
KIRK: Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty. That's all we need.#
KIRK: Ridiculous. What are we running here. Did you examine them? Did you examine Eve?#
KIRK: Well, come on, you're the doctor. What is it? Is it that we're tired, and they're beautiful? They are incredibly beautiful.#
KIRK: What are they?#
KIRK: I asked you first.#
KIRK: I don't follow you.#
KIRK: Lay in. Computer?#
KIRK: More than enough time. Communications, have a representative of the Rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs. Beam him up first pass over their camp.#
KIRK: Not at all, Mister Spock. The choice was burning this lithium crystal or the destruction of another man's ship. Come.#
KIRK: Good. Show them in. I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise. This is my science officer Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price.#
KIRK: What did you have in mind?#
KIRK:  Is there anything else?#
KIRK: No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider those facts too?#
KIRK: It's still no deal.#
KIRK: All right, Childress, you've won. Now I'll take the lithium crystals.#
KIRK: Childress.#
KIRK: You got a better idea?#
KIRK: Just have those crystals here when I get back.#
KIRK: Eve! Eve! Captain's log. Have transported aboard the Enterprise to implement search with infrared scanners and sensing system. Magnetic storms on the planet's surface are cutting down speed and efficiency of our equipment. Search now in progress for three hours, eighteen minutes.#
KIRK: But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way. Satisfied, Mister Scott?#
KIRK: Has Childress reported in yet?#
KIRK: Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left?#
KIRK: Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room.#
KIRK: The name of this game.#
KIRK: Sit down. Tell him. Tell him, Harry.#
KIRK: The Venus drugs, Harry.#
KIRK: Oh, it exists, illegally.#
KIRK: He gave it to the women before you met them.#
KIRK: They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress. They're married. Subspace radio marriage. It was a fraud. They can get out of it.#
KIRK: Quite a woman, eh, Childress?#
KIRK: By herself. She took no drug.#
KIRK: Coloured gelatin.#
KIRK: There's only one kind of woman.#
KIRK: You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk.#
KIRK: Stand by. Do I beam down a search party?#
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium crystals.#
KIRK: Eve?#
KIRK: Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd.#
KIRK: I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness at your trial. If you think that'll help.#
KIRK: Why should I work your side of the street?#
KIRK: Ahead full.#
KIRK: That should make a good specimen.#
KIRK: Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero.#
KIRK: What happened?#
KIRK: Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay.#
KIRK: Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy.#
KIRK: I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the transporter room unattended.#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to.#
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman.#
KIRK: That's all.#
KIRK: Saurian brandy. Back to duty status, Fisher. I have no sympathy for clumsiness.#
KIRK:  I said, give me the brandy! (leaves with bottle and goes to Rand's quarters)#
KIRK: Yeah.#
KIRK: Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?#
KIRK: Like what?#
KIRK: That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it?#
KIRK: Our good doctor's been putting you on again.#
KIRK: I'll tell him you were properly annoyed.#
KIRK: What is it, Scotty?#
KIRK: Yes?#
KIRK: Oh, my.#
KIRK: Jim will do here, Janice.#
KIRK: You're too beautiful to ignore. Too much woman. We've both been pretending too long.  Stop pretending. Let's stop pretending. Come here, Janice. Don't fight me. Don't fight me, Janice.#
KIRK: Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! (forces her onto the floor, she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as Fisher is passing by)#
KIRK: Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting here since you left me. Alone, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's going on.#
KIRK: Sickbay. (just missing the other Kirk nursing grazed knuckles, who goes into his quarters)#
KIRK: Us?#
KIRK: Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any scratches?#
KIRK: Yeoman. I was in my room. It wasn't me.#
KIRK: Fisher saw?#
KIRK: It wasn't me!#
KIRK: Do you know what you're saying?#
KIRK: How did all this happen?#
KIRK: Does the transporter work at all?#
KIRK: How long will it take you to find the trouble?#
KIRK: We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark. They'll die. The surface temperature of that planet goes down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night.#
KIRK: Yes, I know, Scotty.#
KIRK: Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister Spock. Organise search parties.#
KIRK: Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed. The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked, on setting number one. There can't be any chance of him being killed. He's to be taken without. If the men are forced to fire, he can't be killed.#
KIRK: Tell them.#
KIRK: Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know.#
KIRK: Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock. What I don't know is why I forgot that just now. Mister Spock, if you see me slipping again, your orders, your orders are to tell me.#
KIRK: Section chiefs, assign personnel to the search. All search parties#
KIRK: Something?#
KIRK: Oh, yes, yes. All hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force.#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk!#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! Wilson!#
KIRK: Wilson, give me your phaser.#
KIRK: How have you been?#
KIRK: Isn't there any way we can help them?#
KIRK: Then we've got to get those men up.#
KIRK: We've got to find him before he, but how?#
KIRK: The lower levels. The Engineering deck.#
KIRK: No. I don't want anyone else to see the#
KIRK: Mister Spock, if I'm to be the Captain, I've got to act like one.#
KIRK: You can't hurt me. You can't kill me. You can't. Don't you understand? I'm part of you. You need me. I need you.#
KIRK: Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me?#
KIRK: What is your point, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: For how long?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: I'll see what we can do.#
KIRK: Engineering deck, Kirk here.#
KIRK: That unit, Scotty, status report.#
KIRK: How bad is it?#
KIRK: Kirk here, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store.#
KIRK: What happened?#
KIRK: He's not dying? KIRK: Yes, he is.#
KIRK: How can he die? Can I survive without him?#
KIRK: Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it!#
KIRK: I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without him. I don't want him back. He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me. Me.#
KIRK: Human.#
KIRK: What do I have?#
KIRK: Not enough. I have a ship to command.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Coming.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Yes, yes. Go ahead.#
KIRK: Don't hurt him.#
KIRK: Yes, yes, that sounds likely.#
KIRK: Get the transporter room ready.#
KIRK: That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check everything.#
KIRK: No, I don't think I've for#
KIRK: Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones. Their lives#
KIRK: Help me. Somebody make the decision.#
KIRK: No. No, I'm not.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the autopsy.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die.#
KIRK: Go through the transporter, both of us.#
KIRK: It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to do.#
KIRK: Janice, hello.#
KIRK: Yeoman, I owe you an explanation.#
KIRK: Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later?#
KIRK:  Bridge.#
KIRK: Yes, I know.#
KIRK: Can half a man live?#
KIRK: Then we'll both die.#
KIRK: You will. Both of us.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: If this doesn't work.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Get those men aboard fast.#
KIRK: How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.#
KIRK: Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us.#
KIRK: The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him.#
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman.#
KIRK: This is the Captain speaking. Navigator, set in course correction. Helmsman, steady as she goes.#
KIRK: Shall we pick some flowers, Doctor? When a man visits an old girlfriend she usually expects something like that.#
KIRK: They'll be along. You rushed us down ten minutes early. (enter building) [Crater's home]#
KIRK: Professor Crater? Professor? Mrs. Crater? Nervous, Dr. McCoy?#
KIRK:  Mrs. Crater. I've heard a great deal about you.#
KIRK: Something wrong, Darnell?#
KIRK: Why don't you step outside, Darnell.#
KIRK: Maybe I'll step outside, too.#
KIRK: Plum?#
KIRK: Professor Crater, I'm Captain Kirk. This is#
KIRK: Quote. All research personnel on alien planets are required to have their health certified by a starship surgeon at one year intervals. Like it or not, Professor, as commander of the starship, I'm required#
KIRK: He's all yours, Plum. Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: She went out to get you.#
KIRK: Yes. Why?#
KIRK: Quite all right.#
KIRK: She's got some grey, Bones. Excuse me, Professor, she's a handsome woman, yes, but hardly twenty five.#
KIRK:  McCoy.#
KIRK: What happened?#
KIRK: I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what happened.#
KIRK: We're well aware of our next duties, Professor. We'll complete your examinations tomorrow. Transporter room.#
KIRK: Lock onto us. Three beaming up.#
KIRK: Something new to me.#
KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. She said she saw him eat the plant.#
KIRK: There were bits of the plant in his mouth.#
KIRK: Then what kills a healthy man#
KIRK: How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest me. I've lost a man. I want to know what killed him.#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: And Professor Crater and wife?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: Can you explain that, Doctor?#
KIRK: How? There isn't a mark on his body.#
KIRK: You called that skin mottling.#
KIRK: I'm not counting them, Bones. Are you in the mood for an apology?#
KIRK: Perhaps you were. Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to mention one item they needed.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, outfit a landing party. We're beaming down with some questions. [Crater's home]#
KIRK: I have, Professor. Believe me, I have. Where is Mrs. Crater? I want to talk to her, too.#
KIRK: Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again.#
KIRK: Green, find her.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Sturgeon, transport a sample of the plant to Mister Spock. We'll check if it's actually the Borgia plant or something we don't understand.  You got that, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Your complaint is noted, sir. Look, something we don't understand killed one of my men. It could prove to be a danger to you and Mrs. Crater, too.#
KIRK: Bones, tell the professor what the autopsy revealed.#
KIRK: And by coincidence, both you and Mrs. Crater requested salt tablets.#
KIRK: We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet like this, Professor, but it's a mystery, and I don't like mysteries. They give me a bellyache and I've got a beauty right now.#
KIRK: One of the missions of the Enterprise is to protect human life in places like this. I'm going to have to ask you and Mrs. Crater to stay aboard my ship until we find out what killed that crewman.#
KIRK: But I can, Professor. How? You've been here five years. Will a couple of days make a difference? Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Arrange quarters for Professor and Mrs. Crater. Did you get the plant analysis?#
KIRK: Professor Crater! Professor! Professor!#
KIRK: We'd better locate Crewman Green. Green! Green! Crewman Green, report! Green!#
KIRK: I don't know. Green!  Did you see this?#
KIRK: Crater!#
KIRK: We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor.#
KIRK: We can't search this whole planet on foot.#
KIRK: You could learn something from Mister Spock, Doctor. Stop thinking with your glands. We've equipment aboard the Enterprise that could pinpoint a match lit anywhere on this planet, or the heat of a body. Transporter room, Kirk speaking. Three to beam up. [Transporter room]#
KIRK: Kirk to Bridge.#
KIRK: Break out the surface search equipment. I want co-ordinates on two people.#
KIRK: There's a body down there. Sturgeon.#
KIRK: You could use some sleep, Bones.#
KIRK: Bridge.#
KIRK: Professor and Nancy Crater.#
KIRK: Expand search radius.#
KIRK: All right. We'll triangulate on him. We'll let Professor Crater explain what happened to his wife.  Remember my instructions, Lieutenant. Keep a tight fix on us. If we let out a yell I want an armed party down there before the echo dies.#
KIRK: Professor Crater.#
KIRK: We? Where's your wife, Professor? We're concerned about her.#
KIRK: Where's your wife, Professor?#
KIRK: We're worried about her safety. Aren't you? Professor, you're a reasonable man, let me  Kirk here.#
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Sulu. Spock has something.#
KIRK: He beamed up to the ship with us.#
KIRK: Enterprise from Kirk.#
KIRK: You have an intruder aboard. Could be masquerading as Crewman Green. General quarters, security condition three.#
KIRK: Negative, Lieutenant, but keep locked in on us. Kirk out. Let's get him.#
KIRK: Set your phaser on one quarter. I'll leave mine on stun.#
KIRK: He's not trying to kill us, he's trying to frighten us, and he's doing a pretty good job.#
KIRK: Set.#
KIRK: Your wife, Professor. Where is she? Your wife, Professor. Where is she?#
KIRK: The last of her kind?#
KIRK: Just stunned. You'll be able to think in a minute.#
KIRK: Where's your wife? Where is she now?#
KIRK: When?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: It's definite, Mister Sulu. The intruder can assume any shape. Crewmen, you, myself, anyone. Do you understand?#
KIRK: Go to GQ four.#
KIRK: Kirk to transporter room. Three to beam up.#
KIRK: There's one, Professor. Your creature is killing my people.#
KIRK: Yeoman Rand, how long was this Green with you?#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Dr. McCoy?#
KIRK: Medical department report, Doctor.#
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Continue the search. Crater, we don't know who or what we're looking for. We need your help, and now.#
KIRK: Can you recognise this thing When you see it? Professor, I'll forego charges up to this point but this creature's aboard my ship and I'll have it, or I'll have your skin, or both. Now where is it?#
KIRK: And it becomes Nancy for you.#
KIRK: You bleed too much, Crater. You're too pure and noble. Are you saving the last of its kind or has this become Crater's private heaven, here on this planet? This thing becomes wife, lover, best friend, wise man, fool, idol, slave. It isn't a bad life to have everyone in the universe at your beck and call, and you win all the arguments.#
KIRK: Have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes?#
KIRK: Are you going to help us find it?#
KIRK: Doctor?#
KIRK: Take him.#
KIRK: Dead. But it had you, too.#
KIRK: Move aside, Bones.#
KIRK: She's not Nancy, Bones.#
KIRK: It killed four crewmen. Now Crater.#
KIRK: The creature. It kills. It needs salt to live. Bones, move aside.#
KIRK: My guess is she needs more. You want it, Nancy? Come and get it.#
KIRK: Not fright. Hunger. Look at her.#
KIRK: Come on. You want this, Nancy? Come on Nancy. Come and get it. Come and get it. Here it is.#
KIRK: McCoy, get out of the way!#
KIRK: Get out of the way. (McCoy and Kirk struggle for the phaser while Nancy grabs and eats the salt tablets. McCoy wins and is pushed away, then she transfixes Kirk and reaches for his face)#
KIRK: I'm sorry, Bones.;#
KIRK: I was thinking about the buffalo, Mister Spock. Warp one, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Captain here.#
KIRK: Better have Medicine look them over too. Tell Mister Spock I'll meet him there in ten minutes. Kirk out.#
KIRK: How are they?#
KIRK: You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here. You keep wondering, you keep signing on. Any guesses, Mister Spock? Any idea of what happened down there?#
KIRK: You'd better get some rest.#
KIRK: Set up those tapes, Mister Spock. We'll see if the answers are there.#
KIRK: Almost as though they were irrational, drugged. An engineer sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything. A woman strangled. A crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand.#
KIRK: And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower. If the image wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable. Not even a theory, gentlemen?#
KIRK: Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the breakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?#
KIRK: The purpose of a briefing, gentlemen, is to get me answers based on your abilities and experience. In a critical orbit, there's no time for surprise.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: On our way, Lieutenant. I'll hold you to that half second, Scotty.#
KIRK: Compensate, Mister Riley.#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: Tormolen's record?#
KIRK: Was he trying to kill himself?#
KIRK: Doesn't sound like the man I know.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Compensate.  Compensate.#
KIRK: Uhura, monitor communications. Tell McCoy I'll be there when I can.#
KIRK: Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.#
KIRK: Engine room from Bridge.#
KIRK: Tie into the helm, Scotty. If we should call for power, we'll want it fast.#
KIRK: Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact.#
KIRK: Coincidence? Maybe.#
KIRK: That's exactly what I was going to ask.#
KIRK: That's not good enough.#
KIRK: Bones, I want the impossible checked out too.#
KIRK: What were their symptoms?#
KIRK: Irrational, or drugged.#
KIRK: Security, Lieutenant Uhura.#
KIRK: Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine. I want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked.#
KIRK: Put Security on it.#
KIRK: Present condition of Psi 2000.#
KIRK: Helmsman, stabilise position.#
KIRK: Warp us out of here.#
KIRK: Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her.#
KIRK: Sulu, put that  put that thing away.#
KIRK: I'd like you to teach me that sometime.#
KIRK: Scotty, we need power. Engine room, acknowledge!#
KIRK: Who's this?#
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. Get out of the engine room, navigator. Where's Mister Scott?#
KIRK: Clear that tube, will you?#
KIRK: And burn up. I know, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: How did Riley get in there?#
KIRK: He's cut off both helm and power.#
KIRK: Can't you get to the auxiliary?#
KIRK: Continue the alert, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Cut him off.#
KIRK: Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?#
KIRK: Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor. Is there any way, anything you can do to snap him out of it?#
KIRK: Please, not again.#
KIRK: Get me Sickbay.#
KIRK: See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead.#
KIRK: Get him out of here.#
KIRK: Take the helm.#
KIRK: Take the helm!#
KIRK: At least try cutting him off!#
KIRK: Sorry.#
KIRK: Scotty.#
KIRK: We've got twelve minutes left. It'll take at least two or three of them to get the engines up to power now.#
KIRK: Call me when you've cut through. I want to be there. Kirk out.#
KIRK:  Follow me through. Put your phasers on stun. Don't fire unless he's armed. Go.#
KIRK: Get him out of here.#
KIRK: Scotty, we haven't got much time left.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Scotty!#
KIRK: Scotty, we've got six.#
KIRK: We can balance our engines into a controlled implosion.#
KIRK: Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?#
KIRK: Where have you been? What happened?#
KIRK: We've got four minutes, maybe five.#
KIRK: We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off. No time to regenerate them. Do you hear me? We've got to risk a full-power start!#
KIRK:  You've got to hear me! We need a formula. We've got to risk implosion!#
KIRK: We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.#
KIRK: Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's possible. We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand chance!#
KIRK: Yes, I found Mister Spock! I'm talking to Mister Spock, do you understand?#
KIRK: I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't permit me my life. I've got to live hers.#
KIRK: I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock? You're allowed to notice her. The Captain's not permitted#
KIRK: Now I know why it's called she.#
KIRK: Flesh woman to touch, to hold. A beach to walk on. A few days, no braid on my shoulder.#
KIRK: Scotty, help.#
KIRK: I've got to hang on. Tell them. Clear the corridors, the turbo lift. Hurry.  Never lose you. Never.#
KIRK: Bridge.#
KIRK: Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course.#
KIRK: Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came.#
KIRK:  No beach to walk on.#
KIRK: Engage.#
KIRK: Are you?#
KIRK: Checked elapsed time, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Time warp. We're going backward in time. Helm, begin reversing power. Slowly.#
KIRK: Engines ahead. Warp one.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: The time warp. What did it do to us?#
KIRK: Not those last three days.#
KIRK: We may risk it someday, Mister Spock. Resume course to our next destination, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Steady as she goes.#
KIRK: All right, Chief, begin materialisation. Captain Ramart, I'm Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: How do you do?#
KIRK: Mister Evans. We've heard a great deal about you. Welcome aboard.#
KIRK: Four hundred and twenty eight, to be exact. Is there anything we can do for you, Captain? Medical supplies, provisions?#
KIRK: You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong.#
KIRK: We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen.#
KIRK: This must be a space first. A transport ship that doesn't need anything?#
KIRK: Not even Sarian brandy?#
KIRK: Thank you. KIRK: Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans. Show him to his quarters and drop his records off at Doctor McCoy's office, if you will.#
KIRK: That's a girl. Captain's Log, star date 1533.7. We have taken aboard an unusual passenger for transport to Colony Alpha Five. Charles Evans, the sole survivor of a transport crash fourteen years ago. The child, alone from age three, has not only survived, but has grown to intelligent, healthy adolescence.#
KIRK: Good. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out#
KIRK: Thank you. He's working out a training programme for Charlie Evans. Earth history, his own background, that sort of thing. I'd like you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of, um, er, adolescence.#
KIRK: The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere.#
KIRK: Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still exist on that planet in some form?#
KIRK: Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he needs our help.#
KIRK: Hmm. I'll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with that, or find him one.#
KIRK: On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving. If the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey. Charlie.#
KIRK: Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works.#
KIRK: Me. I see. Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady, er, Charlie, that you er. There's no right way to hit a woman. I mean, man to man is one thing, but, er, man and woman, er, it's, er, it's, er. Well it's, er, another thing. Do you understand?#
KIRK: Excuse me. Kirk here.#
KIRK: I'm on my way to the Bridge now.#
KIRK: I don't think so, Charlie.#
KIRK: Okay.#
KIRK: Kirk here, Captain Ramart.#
KIRK: Re-establish contact.#
KIRK: Keep trying.#
KIRK: Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe scanners, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie?#
KIRK: What about the Antares?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Chief, have you been;#
KIRK: A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost. No reason. Obviously, Captain Ramart was not aware of any trouble. I can't figure it.#
KIRK: I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time?#
KIRK: I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come in, Charlie.#
KIRK: Checkmate.#
KIRK: I prefer to call it inspired.#
KIRK: You play chess, Charlie?#
KIRK: I place you in the hands of our chess master.;#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: Charlie's a seventeen year old boy.#
KIRK: I talked to him about the swat.#
KIRK: Yes, Yeoman, I'll talk to him. I'll look into it.#
KIRK: Come in, Charlie. Er, Charlie. Charlie, do you know anything about this chess piece? Did you notice anything peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon?#
KIRK: Er, no. No, no. Sit down. Charlie, being seventeen is more than how many years you've lived. It's a whole other thing. Doctor McCoy could probably explain the biological conditions. Well, let's, let's use a specific. Yeoman Rand is a woman.#
KIRK: No, there's more to it than that.#
KIRK: Now wait, wait.#
KIRK: You'll live, believe me. There's nothing wrong with you that hasn't gone wrong with every other human male since the model first came up.#
KIRK: You go slow. You be gentle. I mean, it's not a one-way street, you know, how you feel and that's all. It's how the girl feels, too. Don't press, Charlie. If the girl feels anything for you at all, you'll know it. Do you understand?#
KIRK: She's not the girl, Charlie. The years are wrong, for one thing, and there are other things.#
KIRK: No, Charlie.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have and there are a million things you can't have. It's no fun facing that, but that's the way things are.#
KIRK: Hang on tight and survive. Everybody does.#
KIRK: Everybody, Charlie. Me, too.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Ask Mister Spock to see to it. Charlie, come on with me.#
KIRK: You've got to slap the floor to absorb the energy when you fall. Go ahead, try it. Like everything else, it takes practice, Charlie. Try again. Good. That's much better. Here, now I'll show you a shoulder roll. Try that.#
KIRK: Well, it makes it hard to teach you#
KIRK: All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today.#
KIRK: You have to learn to protect yourself in a fall before I do that. It's more than teaching you to defend yourself. Charlie, I want you to learn. Charlie? Hey, Sam, let me borrow you for a couple easy throws, all right?#
KIRK: Watch this, Charlie. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw him. Here we go, Sam.#
KIRK: Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go.;#
KIRK: That wasn't so bad, was it?#
KIRK: Cool off.#
KIRK: Charlie.#
KIRK: What happened to him, Charlie?#
KIRK: That's no answer.#
KIRK: Kirk here. Two men from security, on the double.#
KIRK: I'm confining you to quarters. I want you to stay there.#
KIRK: They won't hurt you, Charlie.  They'll take you to your quarters, Charlie. Go with them.#
KIRK: Go to your quarters.#
KIRK: Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there.#
KIRK: That's your choice, Charlie.#
KIRK: They won't hurt you.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: No, I heard you. Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in the Briefing room.#
KIRK: What are chances that Charlie's not an Earthling, that he's a Thasian?#
KIRK: Well, whatever he is, we have some idea of the power he has. I know what I saw him do in the gymnasium.#
KIRK: Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand. He needs, he wants. Nothing happens fast enough.#
KIRK: He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy.#
KIRK: It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us to Earth Colony Five. Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment. I've talked with him, listened. He's a boy in a man's body, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way.#
KIRK: Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie?#
KIRK: Answer me.#
KIRK: What about us, Charlie?#
KIRK: Lieutenant, raise Colony Five. I want to speak directly to the governor.#
KIRK: Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five. Buy me some time.#
KIRK: Spock, get the doctor up here on the double. How bad is it?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments?#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Release the transmitter.#
KIRK: See to her, Doctor.#
KIRK: That's enough, Charlie.#
KIRK: Leave my crew alone.#
KIRK: I know.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Let him go, too, Charlie.#
KIRK: Because I'm telling you to. Because you need me to run the ship, and I need him.#
KIRK: And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed?#
KIRK: Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one that's coming in.#
KIRK: I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on.#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away with anybody since he took over?#
KIRK: Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big ship. He's taken full control. If we could tax his power, turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you could tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five.#
KIRK: If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no choice, gentlemen, none at all.#
KIRK: Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now.#
KIRK: Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but you're going to have to.#
KIRK: You're going to have to take me on.#
KIRK: You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back, whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! (throws him out of command chair)#
KIRK: It's all right, Yeoman.#
KIRK: The boy belongs with his own kind.#
KIRK: With training, we can teach him to live in our society. If he can be taught not to use his power#
KIRK: Is there nothing you can do?#
KIRK: It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Maintain course to outpost four. Keep me informed. Kirk out. (At the door, a young lady in gold uniform and a pretty head-dress takes Scott's arm and is escorted into the room, to the strains of 'Here Comes The Bride'. Kirk goes to the rostrum.) KIRK: Since the days of the first wooden vessels, all shipmasters have had one happy privilege. That of uniting two people in the bonds of matrimony. We are gathered here today with you, Angela Martine, and you, Robert Tomlinson, in the sight of your fellows, in accordance with our laws and our many beliefs so that you may pledge your#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Full ahead. All decks, condition red.#
KIRK: Scotty.#
KIRK: Did Outpost 4 give anything at all on the attacking vessel, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, put this star sector on our screen. Now show our position. Signal this to all decks, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: By any man aboard. Listen carefully. Science Officer.#
KIRK: What you do not know and must be told is that my command orders on this subject are precise and inviolable. No act, no provocation#
KIRK: Both these outposts and this vessel will be considered expendable. Captain out.#
KIRK: After a whole century, what will a Romulan ship look like, Mister Stiles? I doubt they'll radio and identify themselves.#
KIRK: I had no idea that history was your specialty.#
KIRK: Their war, Mister Stiles. Not yours. Don't forget it. STILES; Yes, sir.#
KIRK: Outpost 2 was the first to go silent, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Open a channel to our nearest command base. Quarter hour reports on our position and status.#
KIRK: Call battle stations, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Energise main phasers, Mister Styles. All weapons to full power.#
KIRK: Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status?#
KIRK: Confirm what hit you, Hansen. What vessel? Identity?#
KIRK: Can you locate the intruder for us?#
KIRK: Tie us in.#
KIRK: Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen. What do you have on the intruder?#
KIRK: Lock us onto your screen.#
KIRK: Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range.#
KIRK: Make a challenge. Warn that ship off.#
KIRK: Position of the intruder, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: When they opened fire. Perhaps necessary when they use their#
KIRK: Go to full magnification.#
KIRK: I don't see anything. I can't understand it.#
KIRK: Discontinue. Contact remaining outposts. Have them signal us any sightings or sensor readings in their area.#
KIRK: Their invisibility screen may work both ways. With that kind of power consumption, they may not be able to see us.#
KIRK: Parallel course.#
KIRK: Negative. You and Mister Sulu will match its course and speed with the object on our sensors exactly, move for move. If he has sensors, I want him to think we're a reflection, an echo. Under no circumstances are you to cross into the Neutral Zone without my direct orders.#
KIRK: Cancel battle stations. All decks, standby alert.#
KIRK: Mister Stiles.#
KIRK: Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders?#
KIRK: Very well. All decks, security alert.#
KIRK: Pipe it in.#
KIRK: Put it on the screen. (Up shimmers an image of a group of four humanoids around a console. One leaves his post and salutes the figure with his back to us. That figure then turns, and we see someone who looks just like - a Vulcan. Both Spock's eyebrows hit the ceiling. There's a long silence and a lot of stares.) KIRK: Decoding?#
KIRK: I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles.#
KIRK: Repeat it.#
KIRK: I assume you're complimenting Mister Spock on his ability to decode.#
KIRK: Well, here's one thing you can be sure of, Mister. Leave any bigotry in your quarters. There's no room for it on the Bridge. Do I make myself clear?#
KIRK: Stay with him, helm.#
KIRK: What's our position, navigator?#
KIRK: Bring it to the briefing room. Are you ready, gentlemen?#
KIRK: Comments?#
KIRK: Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains. Can we engage them with a reasonable possibility of victory?#
KIRK: Meaning we can outrun them?#
KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions.#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: Sit down, Mister.#
KIRK: Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight?#
KIRK: Captain to Bridge.#
KIRK: What's our position?#
KIRK: Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports?#
KIRK: And at this distance?#
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Comet Icarus four. Composition?#
KIRK: And when an object passes through it, even an invisible object?#
KIRK: Our chance, gentlemen. Prepare to attack. All hands, battle stations. I hope we won't need your services, Bones.#
KIRK: Battle status?#
KIRK: Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles.#
KIRK: The moment he begins entering the comet's tail, he becomes visible. End run, gentlemen. We'll swing around the other side and catch him at that moment.#
KIRK: Let's get him, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Steady as she goes. Phaser crews ready?#
KIRK: He'll only be visible for a moment. Stand by.#
KIRK: At the last moment he must have guessed our move. Hard to starboard, helm!#
KIRK: He did exactly what I would have done. I won't underestimate him#
KIRK: Full astern! Emergency warp speed!#
KIRK: Do we have emergency warp?#
KIRK: Navigation?#
KIRK: Phasers, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately.#
KIRK: Yeoman. Affirmative. Continue log entries.#
KIRK: Limited range.#
KIRK: Back to his old course.#
KIRK: I wouldn't make that assumption. I don't think their Captain will either.#
KIRK: Same as before, Mister Sulu. Stay with him. {Romulan ship]#
KIRK: Let's get them while we are. Before we enter the Neutral Zone. Full ahead, Mister Sulu. Maximum warp.#
KIRK: Phasers, stand by.#
KIRK: We know their Achilles heel, Mister Stiles. Their weapon takes all their energy. They must become visible in order to launch it.#
KIRK: I'm aware of that, Mister Stiles. Are phasers ready?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, inform Command base, In my opinion, no option. On my responsibility, we are proceeding into the Neutral Zone. Steady as we go, Mister Sulu. Continue firing.#
KIRK: Cease fire.#
KIRK: However?#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: Go to sensor probes.#
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock, work quietly.#
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. Bring it to the Bridge. I'll be there in a moment.#
KIRK: I wish I were on a long sea voyage somewhere. Not too much deck tennis, no frantic dancing, and no responsibility. Why me? I look around that Bridge, and I see the men waiting for me to make the next move. And Bones, what if I'm wrong?#
KIRK: No, I don't really expect an answer.#
KIRK: It's all right. It's all right.#
KIRK: Power on. Reverse course. He'll try to slip under us.#
KIRK: Phasers, fire.#
KIRK: Cease fire.#
KIRK: Analysis, quickly.#
KIRK: Helm, hard over. Phasers, fire point-blank.#
KIRK: Captain to Sickbay.#
KIRK: Casualties?#
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor.  Report, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Ship damage?#
KIRK: Weapons status?#
KIRK: Fully operable, Scotty?#
KIRK: Go. Lieutenant Uhura, take over navigation.#
KIRK: Maybe we can pull them back to our side of the Neutral Zone. Hold our position. Play dead.#
KIRK: Forward phasers, stand by. Fire! Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire!#
KIRK: Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Stiles! (Spock enters just as Stiles tries and fails to reach the firing button. He activates the controls and the phaser pulses hit the Romulan ship)#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, prepare to move in on the Romulan vessel. Ship-to-ship, Uhura. Put this on the screen.#
KIRK: Captain. Standing by to beam your survivors aboard our ship. Prepare to abandon your vessel.#
KIRK: What purpose will it serve to die?#
KIRK: Are you all right, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: And you, Stiles?#
KIRK: How many men did we lose, Bones?#
KIRK: It never makes any sense. We both have to know that there was a reason.#
KIRK: We're entering standard orbit, Nurse. It won't be much longer.#
KIRK: I understand you gave up a career in bio-research to sign aboard a starship.#
KIRK: It's been five years since his last message.#
KIRK: Put it on all frequencies, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: But the surface temperature of that planet is one hundred degrees below zero.#
KIRK: Required reading at the academy, Mister Spock. I've always wanted to meet him. Do you think there's any chance of him still being alive?#
KIRK: Keep trying.#
KIRK: And since then two expeditions have failed to find him.#
KIRK: Enterprise to Korby. We have your co-ordinates pin-pointed. We're preparing to beam down a party. It may interest you that we have aboard this vessel#
KIRK: The man making it is Doctor Roger Korby.#
KIRK: Agreed, Doctor. However, there will be two of us.#
KIRK: We're on our way, Doctor. We'll be with you in a moment. Enterprise out.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Doctor Korby? Doctor Korby. It's possible we may have hit the wrong entry point. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Beam down two security men.#
KIRK: Some delay in meeting us. Probably nothing at all. Kirk out. Corridors could be quite deep. Getting here may have taken more time than he estimated. Don't worry.#
KIRK: Rayburn, maintain post here.#
KIRK: Matthews, we'll look for Doctor Korby. Accompany us.#
KIRK: Is that you, Doctor Korby?#
KIRK: Is there a path down there?#
KIRK: Any chance of a projection or a ledge?#
KIRK: Not soon enough.#
KIRK: You do know him well? An old friend?#
KIRK: Captain Kirk to Rayburn. Report.#
KIRK: Where is Doctor Korby?#
KIRK: There's no need to apologise, sir, and certainly no need to introduce yourself.#
KIRK: It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to make a security confirmation. When I call my ship, if you list your personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs#
KIRK: Rayburn, are you receiving?#
KIRK: I've lost contact with my guard. I'm required to call my ship.#
KIRK: Sir, one man is dead. I've lost contact with the other.#
KIRK: What are you doing?#
KIRK: Drop it! (he fires, Brown falls straight backwards and the big figure bursts in and lifts Kirk off his feet. Chapel screams as she sees the hole in Brown reveals electronic parts)#
KIRK: Yes, I know your reputation. The whole galaxy knows who you are and what you stand for. That's why all this makes no sense.#
KIRK: Or disobey an order from her.#
KIRK: Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced?#
KIRK: A simple layman's question, Doctor. Where is my other crewman? Alive? Dead?#
KIRK: Where is my other crewman?#
KIRK: He's an android like Brown?#
KIRK: You've convinced me, Doctor. You've convinced me that you're dangerous.#
KIRK: If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you programme them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor.#
KIRK: Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear? Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed#
KIRK: As far as I know.#
KIRK: Well, there's one difference between us. I'm hungry.#
KIRK: Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never know.#
KIRK: He's an exact duplicate?#
KIRK: What about memory? Tell me about Sam.#
KIRK: He saw me off on this mission.#
KIRK: He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research station.#
KIRK: Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences.#
KIRK: Programming. Different word, but the same old promises made by Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis.#
KIRK: It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness, sentiment. The other side of the coin, Doctor.#
KIRK: All you wanted before was my understanding.#
KIRK: Yes, yes. No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds.#
KIRK: You've created your own Kirk. Why do you need me?#
KIRK: I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think! (leaps up with cord he's untied from the chair leg and loops it around Korby's throat) Stand back, Ruk! I'll kill him! Stay back. (goes through door, releasing Korby into Ruk's arms)#
KIRK: Christine, is that you? (Ruk sneaks up and they struggle, ending up with Kirk dangling from the edge of the pit. After thinking about it, Ruk pulls him up to safety)#
KIRK: Andrea, kiss me. (she does, then raises her arm to slap him. He stops her and pulls her in for a passionate embrace)#
KIRK: What's the matter, Andrea? Confused?#
KIRK: Emotion, Ruk? You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my life?#
KIRK: Why? Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that? What happened to the old ones, Ruk?#
KIRK: Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them?#
KIRK: And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve.#
KIRK: And Korby?#
KIRK: The danger to you is Korby.#
KIRK: The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to destroy them.#
KIRK: That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to destroy you!#
KIRK: You were a man with respect for all things alive. How can I explain the change in you? If I was to tell Earth I was in your hands, to tell them what has become (jumps Korby and traps his arm in a door. The skin tears to reveal electronics)#
KIRK: Spock. He must've got my message.#
KIRK: She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk. Is this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another? Aren't you doing exactly what you hate most in humans, killing with no more concern than when you turn off a light?#
KIRK: Then prove it. Give me that phaser gun. If there's any human left in you, give it to me.#
KIRK: Andrea, give me the weapon.#
KIRK: In here, Spock.#
KIRK: Doctor Korby was never here.#
KIRK: She's staying with the ship. Something bothering you, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: I'll remember that Mister Spock, the next time I find myself in a similar situation. Steady as we go, helm.#
KIRK: Having trouble, gentlemen?#
KIRK: You're beaming cargo down to a penal colony, Mister Berkeley.#
KIRK: U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.#
KIRK: Request opening in your force field for beaming down of cargo.#
KIRK: Energise. Any incoming cargo?#
KIRK: Oh, Mister Berkeley, you might refamiliarise yourself with the manual on penal colony procedures.#
KIRK: I think you can take the time to lock this up first.#
KIRK: I would like to have met Doctor Adams. Have you ever been to a penal colony since they started following his theories?#
KIRK: You're behind the times, Bones. They're more like resort colonies now.#
KIRK: Enterprise acknowledging. Stand by. Security alert three.#
KIRK: Security control, this is the Bridge. Come in.#
KIRK: Enterprise to Tantalus colony.#
KIRK: Doctor Adams? This is Captain Kirk. It appears we may have an inmate of yours aboard the ship.#
KIRK: Make that definite, Doctor. He's aboard.#
KIRK: We'll keep you posted, Doctor. Kirk out.#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: At gunpoint?#
KIRK: No promises. Give me the weapon.#
KIRK: Take him to Sickbay. Reverse course. Head back for Tantalus colony.#
KIRK: Your report said he was quite talkative.#
KIRK: Not our problem, Bones.#
KIRK: What did you say your name was?#
KIRK: Estimated arrival at Tantalus?#
KIRK: What's so fascinating?#
KIRK: Doctor Van Gelder?#
KIRK: Committed to Tantalus colony when?#
KIRK: Ship to surface, Tantalus colony.#
KIRK: U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.#
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. I'd like to speak to Doctor Adams.#
KIRK: Doctor Adams, regarding your escaped man#
KIRK: No casualties, sir. This man is Doctor Simon Van Gelder?#
KIRK: No harm to him, sir. We thought you might enlighten us as to his condition.#
KIRK: Tragedy, Doctor.#
KIRK: Er, Doctor Adams, please stand by. Explain.#
KIRK: You don't believe him, and you can't explain it. Bones, are you aware that in the last twenty years Doctor Adams has done more to revolutionise, to humanise prisons and the treatment of prisoners than all the rest of humanity had done in forty centuries? I've been to those penal colonies since they've begun following his methods, and they're not cages anymore.#
KIRK: They're clean, decent hospitals for sick minds.#
KIRK: Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder.#
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it up with the ship's surgeon. Stand by. Well, Bones, you've got the ball. You care to recommend a better place?#
KIRK: An assumption, Doctor.#
KIRK: Doctor Adams, this is rather embarrassing. By strict interpretation of our starship regulation, I'm required to initiate an investigation of this so that a proper report#
KIRK: Affirmative, Doctor. I've visited rehab colonies before. Enterprise out. Find me someone in your department with psychiatric and penology experience, if possible.#
KIRK: Mission, routine investigation and report as per ship surgeon's medical log. As for my last entry, it seems I will get to meet Doctor Adams at last. However, I would have preferred other circumstances. Sickbay. Report, Doctor.#
KIRK: And you'd prefer to keep him here until I complete my investigation anyway.#
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor. Bridge out. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Co-ordinates?#
KIRK: Yes, I remember.#
KIRK: Yes, yes, I remember.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you tell McCoy that she had better check out as the best assistant I ever had. Energise.#
KIRK: In here, I presume, Doctor.#
KIRK: This is another time, another place, and another situation.#
KIRK: Elevator, and going down quite a ways.#
KIRK: Doctor Helen Noel. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, sir.#
KIRK: I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.#
KIRK: Doctor.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: Your landing co-ordinates were right on the nose, Mister Spock. We arrived safely, and we're here with Doctor Adams right now. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Before you came here#
KIRK: May I ask what crime you committed?#
KIRK: Quite a tour, Doctor. Very impressive.#
KIRK: Doctor.#
KIRK: Hmm?#
KIRK: May I see it?#
KIRK: Shall we leave it up to the doctor?#
KIRK: One of the advantages of being a Captain, Doctor, is being able to ask for advice without necessarily having to take it.#
KIRK: One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good#
KIRK:  How does it work?#
KIRK: I didn't mean to suggest that he had. The reason I asked, sir, was you haven't mentioned where Doctor Van Gelder's injury occurred.#
KIRK:  Thank you.#
KIRK: Yes. He was injured there. I've seen the room. Doctor Adams explained#
KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Spock. Anything further?#
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor Adams.#
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. Doctor Adams has left with some things to attend to. What is it, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Tell McCoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists that any concern is unjustified. According to Adams, Van Gelder created his own problem.#
KIRK: Not really.#
KIRK: I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Kirk out.#
KIRK: Good evening.#
KIRK: What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon?#
KIRK: I didn't.#
KIRK: But a bit blank.#
KIRK: I'd like to see that treatment room again. You say you're somewhat familiar with the theory behind it?#
KIRK: And if he's lying, he'll continue to lie, and I won't find out a thing. The only way I can be sure is to see that machine at work, or is that too impractical and unscientific of me, Doctor? Well?#
KIRK: I have no desire to damage my brain. Can this be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no?#
KIRK: And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in the slightest?#
KIRK: Mm-hmm.#
KIRK: Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two.#
KIRK: Nothing happened.#
KIRK: Try a harmless suggestion.#
KIRK: You know, when we finally get through this I'd like to locate and raid a kitchen somewhere.#
KIRK: Remarkably effective for a device that Doctor Adams was going to abandon.#
KIRK: Yes. Pick something unusual, an unusual suggestion, something we can both be sure of.#
KIRK: Merry Christmas.#
KIRK: My crew is sworn to secrecy.#
KIRK: You want me to manufacture a lie, wrap it up as a Christmas present for you?#
KIRK: Helen.#
KIRK: For years, I've loved you.#
KIRK: Helen! Helen, don't go! I need you, Helen!#
KIRK: I must drop it.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Argh!  Kirk to Enterprise. Argh!#
KIRK: Helen. Helen, for years I've loved you. Helen.#
KIRK: I've loved you.#
KIRK: For years.#
KIRK: Yes. Yes, I remember. I remember. Helen. Look. The duct. The duct. Give me a hand here. Pull.  Air conditioning. It has to connect with other ducts and tunnels. You can get through this. It might lead to the power supply. Short-circuited, it would cut off the security force field. Have you had any training in hyper-power circuits?#
KIRK: Megavoltage. Touch the wrong line, and you're dead.#
KIRK: I believe in you.#
KIRK: I trust you.#
KIRK: I, argh, I don't know.#
KIRK: I don't know. (Noel makes it to the power control room and finds an off switch but it won't move)#
KIRK:  Helen, are you all right?#
KIRK: Doctor Adams? Doctor A. The treatment room. Follow me.#
KIRK: The power came on.#
KIRK: But he was alone. Can you imagine the mind emptied by that thing? Without even a tormentor for company.#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: Not when you've sat in that room. Take us out of orbit, Mister Spock. Ahead warp factor one.#
KIRK: Earth-style distress signal. SOS.#
KIRK: We're hundreds of light years from Earth, Mister Spock. No colonies or vessels out this far.#
KIRK: Not the Earth, another Earth. Another Earth? Captain's Log, stardate 2713.5. In the distant reaches of our galaxy, we have made an astonishing discovery. Earth type radio signals coming from a planet which apparently is an exact duplicate of the Earth. It seems impossible, but there it is.#
KIRK: Hold us in a fixed orbit, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Still no response, communications?#
KIRK: We'll beam down. Alert security. Prepare to transport landing party to surface. We'll land in the vicinity of the distress signals now being received.#
KIRK: Identical. Earth, as it was in the early 1900s.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: But with the mind of a child. Bones, what is it?#
KIRK: We want to help you.;#
KIRK: What is?#
KIRK:  Come on!#
KIRK: How old is this thing?#
KIRK:  Come out. We mean you no harm.#
KIRK: I'm not going to hurt you.#
KIRK: I won't hurt you.#
KIRK: I only want to talk to you.#
KIRK: Come on.#
KIRK: I won't hurt you.#
KIRK: Come on. It's all right. Come on.#
KIRK: Take the guards, have a look outside. Radioactive readings, chemical pollutions, any further sign of life.#
KIRK: We didn't do anything like that.#
KIRK: Well, of course not. We're here to help.#
KIRK: What happened here? Where is everybody?#
KIRK: No, I don't. Won't you tell me?#
KIRK: What are Grups?#
KIRK: You said something about the Grups doing bad things, yelling, hurting, burning.#
KIRK: You're doing fine.#
KIRK: But what about the children, the Onlies? Didn't the awful things affect them?#
KIRK: More of you? How many?#
KIRK: What's your name?#
KIRK: Miri. A pretty name for a pretty young woman.#
KIRK: Very pretty.#
KIRK: Miri said all the adults died.#
KIRK: There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our questions. Miri, do you know any buildings where the doctors used to work?#
KIRK: Will you take me there?#
KIRK: It's important. Please.#
KIRK: Yes. It's Jim.#
KIRK: Good. I like yours, too. I like you.#
KIRK: I wouldn't lie to you.#
KIRK: Why, thank you.#
KIRK: Yes, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Under no circumstances do I want anyone to beam down from the ship. We can't take any chances with further contamination.#
KIRK: My orders still stand, Lieutenant. You can help us best by clearing the computer banks and standing by. Kirk out. Bones, why do you think the symptoms haven't appeared in Mister Spock?#
KIRK:  Intermediate experimentation report project on life prolongation.#
KIRK: All the adults are dead. Only the children are left alive.#
KIRK: At least they have up to now.#
KIRK: That would explain why there are no adults.#
KIRK: Who die when they enter adolescence.#
KIRK: Loneliness? I don't know, curiosity? I think children have an instinctive need for adults. They want to be told right and wrong.#
KIRK:  Try again. See if you can find anything outside. Hey, clean up that desk for me, will you?#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: That would certainly answer the question of what happened to their parents.#
KIRK: I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman. It might not turn out to be very pretty.#
KIRK: I don't think so.#
KIRK: There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with children. Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children. We've got to do something about the others.#
KIRK: You couldn't get close to the other kids?#
KIRK: I'm going to try. Miri? Come here. You want to go someplace with me?#
KIRK: Dead. I don't understand it. My phaser wasn't set to kill.#
KIRK: We could use some more, if you don't mind.#
KIRK: There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here?#
KIRK: What about Miri?#
KIRK: And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you.#
KIRK: Of course, Mister Spock. We still don't know what we're fighting.#
KIRK: Are You certain about the time we have left?#
KIRK: Is there any possibility#
KIRK: There's no data, no starting point.#
KIRK: Janice, take Miri for a walk.#
KIRK: But do you know what they were up to?#
KIRK: You two will have to recreate their thinking. If you can isolate that virus, we'll be able to develop a vaccine.#
KIRK: I know.#
KIRK: The children! (all dash out, while Jahn sneaks in and collects the communicators from the desks) [Corridor outside Laboratory} KIRK: Anything?#
KIRK: And you?#
KIRK: Haven't you found a thing yet?#
KIRK:  We're all frightened.#
KIRK: Never mind that, what did you find?#
KIRK: Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice?#
KIRK: Where is she? Has something happened to her?#
KIRK: No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you see what's going on?#
KIRK: I've got to find Janice.#
KIRK: We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard.#
KIRK: This is the vaccine?#
KIRK: Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left.#
KIRK: You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You, your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we succeed in what we're doing. You've seen your friends get it.#
KIRK: Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing up the way you are. Don't you know why you don't like to play games anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a young woman, you get the disease. All of you.#
KIRK: All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it. Look at it, Miri, it's in you!#
KIRK: Listen to me. Listen to me!#
KIRK: This isn't a game. It never was a game.#
KIRK: Listen to me! You've got our communicators, the boxes we talk into. We need them to talk to the ship.#
KIRK: No blah blah blah! Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you don't help us, there won't be any games anymore. There won't be anything. Nothing, no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever.#
KIRK: Now listen to me. You've got to help us before it's too late. Let Janice go. Give me those communicators before it's too late.#
KIRK: You've seen your friends change one by one as they grew up. Did you ever see one of them not change? One by one, they got the disease, and they became like, Iike those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise. One by one they changed and got the disease. The disease like I've got, like Miri has. You understand what I'm talking about. You're not babies. We can help you!#
KIRK:  It's waiting for you. It may only be a matter of months.#
KIRK: Look at my arms! That's what's going to happen to you unless you let me help you.#
KIRK: And the little ones. What's going to happen to them after you've gone, after you've turned into creatures like Louise? Oh, they'll still be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone. You've eaten it. Maybe six months left, that's all, and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them. They'll die, too.#
KIRK: All right, you want a foolie? All right. I dare you, I double-dare you. Look at the blood on my face. Now look at your hands. Blood on your hands. Now who's doing the hurting? Not the Grups, it's you hurting, yelling, maybe killing, just like the Grups you remember and creatures you're afraid of. You're acting like them, and you're going to be just like them unless you let me help you. I'm a Grup, and I want to help you. I'm begging you, let me help you or there won't be anything left at all. Please.#
KIRK:  Three hours, eleven minutes left. Thank you, Lieutenant. Keep this channel open. Clear your computers. What happened to him?#
KIRK: Look at his face.#
KIRK: Just children, three hundred years old and more. I've already contacted Space Central. They'll send teachers, advisers.#
KIRK: They'll be all right.#
KIRK: Yes. I never get involved with older women, Yeoman. Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Full ahead. Warp factor one.#
KIRK: Interesting. An Arcturian Macbeth.#
KIRK: You mean to tell me you've called me three light years off my course just to accuse an actor of being Kodos?#
KIRK: You said you discovered a new food concentrate. What am I supposed to put in my log, that you lied? That you diverted a starship with false information? You're not only in trouble, you've put me in trouble, too.#
KIRK: Kodos is dead.#
KIRK: Tom, the authorities closed the book on that case years ago.#
KIRK: Martha, you tell him.#
KIRK: Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that.#
KIRK: He's dead.#
KIRK: And I have to get back to my ship and figure out how I'm going to enter all this in my log. Tom. Martha.#
KIRK: History files. Subject, former Governor Kodos of Tarsus Four, also known as Kodos the Executioner. After that, background on actor Anton Karidian.#
KIRK: Stop. Information on Anton Karidian.#
KIRK: Stop. Give comparative identification between actor Karidian and Governor Kodos.#
KIRK: Give information on actor Karidian prior to Kodos' death.#
KIRK: Photograph Kodos. (an image of a red-haired man with a beard comes on the monitor) Photograph Karidian. (the grey-haired man with a small moustache) Now photograph both.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. You know Doctor Leighton, don't you? Would you say he's given to fantasy?#
KIRK: With a very long memory.#
KIRK: We'll delay departure for a time. I'm beaming back down to the planet.#
KIRK: Where's Tom?#
KIRK: The others are on the patio.#
KIRK: Why not? I saw your performance today. May I extend my appreciation?#
KIRK: Captain James Kirk, Starship Enterprise.#
KIRK: I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally.#
KIRK: An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual.#
KIRK: Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth.#
KIRK: So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move?#
KIRK: She's a good ship.  Thank you. You were very impressive as Lady Macbeth.#
KIRK: Very impressive. Lenore. I'd like to see you again.#
KIRK: Not necessarily.#
KIRK: You don't have a schedule now, do you?#
KIRK: Exactly.#
KIRK: Good. I'll make our apologies to our hostess. I'll meet you outside.#
KIRK: About what?#
KIRK: It's Tom Leighton. He's dead.#
KIRK: I don't know. I'll try and find out.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Put me through to Captain Jon Daily of the AstraI Queen on orbit station, and put it on scramble.#
KIRK: Can you do me a favour?#
KIRK: Don't make your pick-up here.#
KIRK: I'll pick them up. And if there's any trouble, it'll be my responsibility.#
KIRK: Just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks. Over and out. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Transporter room, ready to beam up.#
KIRK: I think we're due for a pick-up.#
KIRK: Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: I'm the Captain.#
KIRK: You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you I arranged it.#
KIRK: Can't you make other arrangements?#
KIRK: It'd be a shame if that happened.#
KIRK: Well.#
KIRK: The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers.#
KIRK: What have you got to trade?#
KIRK: You make it sound very interesting. The crew has been on patrol for a long time. They could use a break in the monotony.#
KIRK: You've got me backed into a corner. The men would never forgive me if I deprived them of your performance, and your presence.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, prepare to leave orbit as soon as the Karidian company is aboard the ship.#
KIRK: Benecia Colony.#
KIRK: If my memory needs refreshing, Mister Spock, I'll ask you for it. In the meantime, follow my orders. Captain's log, stardate 2818.9. There are many questions in my mind, too many, perhaps, about the actor Karidian and his daughter. For personal reasons, I'm almost afraid to learn the answers.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, ETA the Benecia Colony.#
KIRK: Data on question submitted to personnel files.#
KIRK: Stop. Give list.#
KIRK: Stop. Is that star service Lieutenant Kevin Riley?#
KIRK: Stop. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Kevin Riley in communications, I wish to have him transferred down to the engineering decks.#
KIRK: I'm sending him back.#
KIRK: I don't wish to discuss it, Mister Spock. Please follow my orders.#
KIRK: It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard.#
KIRK: This is the observation deck. That's the flight deck down there with the shuttle craft.#
KIRK: Isn't it?#
KIRK: Anything.#
KIRK: If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music and flowers. Unfortunately, it isn't so. On the Enterprise, we try to duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible.#
KIRK: It's very old.#
KIRK: Come from a very human source.#
KIRK: You can count on it.#
KIRK: I'd rather talk about you. You must have wanted to perform since you first saw your father act. When was that?#
KIRK: Tell me about it.#
KIRK: What would you like to know?#
KIRK: Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always remains a woman.#
KIRK: Come.#
KIRK: Will he make it?#
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it.#
KIRK: All right.#
KIRK: Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock? My personal business,#
KIRK: You think that happened?#
KIRK: I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs. Not even my second in command.#
KIRK: I know what he's doing, and I don't like it.#
KIRK: And you also know that nothing is proven.#
KIRK: I'm not. I'm interested in justice.#
KIRK: No, I'm not sure. I wish I was. I've done things I've never done before. I've placed my command in jeopardy. From here on I've got to determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos.#
KIRK: You sound certain. I wish I could be. Before I accuse a man of that, I've got to be. I saw him once, twenty years ago. Men change. Memory changes. Look at him now, he's an actor. He can change his appearance. No. Logic is not enough. I've got to feel my way, make absolutely sure.#
KIRK: No, but they may rest easier.#
KIRK: Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt. Besides, I have an idea may prove#
KIRK: A phaser.#
KIRK: This is the Captain. There's a phaser on overload in my quarters. If it blows, it'll take out the entire deck. Evacuate all personnel in this quadrant. Double Red Alert.  You get out of here.#
KIRK: Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it.#
KIRK:  We're overdue for our talk, aren't we?#
KIRK: A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have destroyed several decks of this ship. Before that, someone tried to poison one of my crewmen.#
KIRK: I'm sure you are. Are you Kodos? I asked you a question.#
KIRK: I do.#
KIRK: You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago?#
KIRK: So was I. But I remember. Let's see if you do. Read this into that communicator on the wall. It will be recorded and compared to a piece of Kodos' voice film we have in our files. The test is virtually infallible. It will tell us whether you're Karidian, or Kodos the Executioner.  Ready for voice test. Disguising your voice will make no difference.#
KIRK: I remember the words. I wrote them down. You said them like you knew them. You hardly glanced at the paper.#
KIRK: Are you sure? Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front of a captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy?#
KIRK: We've armed man with tools. The striving for greatness continues. But Kodos#
KIRK: Or is.#
KIRK: All I understand is that four thousand people were needlessly butchered.#
KIRK: But he didn't. And history has made its judgment.#
KIRK: Those beautiful words, well acted, change nothing.#
KIRK: There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to twenty years ago.#
KIRK: If I had gotten everything I wanted, you might not walk out of this room alive.#
KIRK: In the beginning perhaps. But later, I wanted it to be more than that.#
KIRK: If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves. And if he isn't, then we'll let you off at Benecia, and no harm done.#
KIRK: Who do I have to be?#
KIRK: But not an exact match, Mister Spock. We're dealing with a man's life. No machine can make that decision.#
KIRK: You've made your point, Doctor.#
KIRK: This is the Captain. Security two alert. Find and restrain Lieutenant Kevin Riley. He's armed and possibly headed towards the ship's theatre.#
KIRK: Riley, get back to the Sickbay.#
KIRK: You could be wrong. Don't throw away your life on a mistake.#
KIRK: It's an order. Give me the weapon.#
KIRK: Now get back to Sickbay. Go on. (Riley leaves, and there is polite applause at the end of the scene on stage. Karidian comes backstage.)#
KIRK: Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you.#
KIRK: The play is over. It's been over for twenty years.#
KIRK: By killing seven innocent men.#
KIRK: Guard.#
KIRK: You'll never get off the ship.#
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Leslie. All channels cleared, Uhura?#
KIRK: Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie.#
KIRK: Ahead warp factor one, Mister Leslie.#
KIRK: No problem, Commissioner. And may I remind you that I have standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena wherever they may be encountered. Besides, it's three days to Makus. And the rendezvous doesn't take place for five.#
KIRK: No problem. Captain to Galileo. All systems cleared for take off.#
KIRK: Launch shuttlecraft. (The curved doors at the stern of the engineering deck open, and the little vessel heads out into space)#
KIRK: Anything at all?#
KIRK: Try and get me a fix on the Galileo.#
KIRK: That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of our instruments work. At least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity. And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot shuttlecraft, off course, out of control. Finding a needle in a haystack would be child's play. Captain's Log, stardate 2821.7. The electromagnetic phenomenon known as Murasaki Three Twelve whirls like some angry blight in space, a depressive reminder that seven shipmates still have not been heard from. Equally bad, the effect has rendered our normal searching systems useless. Without them, we are blind and almost helpless.#
KIRK: I'm aware of that, Commissioner. At the same time I have certain scientific duties I must perform, and investigating the Murasaki effect is one.#
KIRK: We have two days to find them.#
KIRK: What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there?#
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Set course for Taurus Two.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Anything on your scanners?#
KIRK: Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power?#
KIRK: Transport room, this is the captain speaking. Are the transporters beaming up yet?#
KIRK: Thank you. This is the captain speaking. Flight deck, prepare Columbus for immediate exit, for a search of the planet surface. Correlate co-ordinates with Mister Sulu. Thank you. Anything, Uhura?#
KIRK: We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner.#
KIRK: Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment.#
KIRK: I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner. I know all about your authority. Launch shuttlecraft Columbus.#
KIRK: Have them proceed to the next quadrant. Any word from engineering on our sensors?#
KIRK: What about the transporters?#
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Yes, Commissioner?#
KIRK: I haven't forgotten, Commissioner.#
KIRK: I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner. This is the captain. Try using overload power on the transporters. We've got to get them working.#
KIRK: Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every lap from now on.#
KIRK: It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of the planet's surface. Mind your helm, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Good. This is the captain. Landing parties one, two, and three, report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the planet. Ordinance condition One A.#
KIRK: I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant. It's almost the only tool we have that'll work.#
KIRK: What word from the sensor section?#
KIRK: I'm not interested in the last report. I want to know now.#
KIRK: I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left.#
KIRK: You do that.#
KIRK: What about radio communication?#
KIRK: Do? I intend to continue the search. Foot by foot, inch by inch, by candlelight if necessary, until the last possible moment. And if you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful.#
KIRK: I'm in command here, Mister Ferris.#
KIRK:  Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: There are casualties?#
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. You'd better report to Sickbay yourself.#
KIRK: But they're still out there.#
KIRK: The Columbus hasn't returned yet. I still have two search parties out.#
KIRK: Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search parties from the surface. Attempt to contact the Columbus.#
KIRK: Then have them return immediately. Mister Sulu, prepare to abandon search. Set course for Makus Three. Captain's log, supplement. The search parties have returned to the ship, and the Columbus is on its way back. I have been compelled to abandon the search.#
KIRK: What about the other systems?#
KIRK: Stand ready, Mister Sulu. How long before the Columbus comes on board?#
KIRK: Twenty three minutes.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal speed.#
KIRK: Those are my orders. Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections to direct beams aft. Full function, continuous operation until further orders.#
KIRK: Sensors, a meteorite?#
KIRK: A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, contact transporter room. All beams ready. Full normal speed.#
KIRK: Activate beams. (Our last view inside Galileo is of lots of smoke, then transporter beams)#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, proceed on course to Makus Three. Ahead warp factor one.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: There's really something I don't understand about all of this. Maybe you can explain it to me. Logically, of course. When you jettisoned the fuel and ignited it, you knew there was virtually no chance of it being seen, yet you did it anyhow. That would seem to me to be an act of desperation.#
KIRK: Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does your well-known logic explain that?#
KIRK: I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst.#
KIRK: You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life, you committed a purely human emotional act?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you're a stubborn man.#
KIRK: No. But the death of the crewman.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Where's Mister Spock with that computer log extract?#
KIRK: Kirk out.;#
KIRK: I agree. I waited until the last possible moment. We were on Red Alert. The storm got worse. I had to jettison the pod.#
KIRK: What took you so long, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Jamie.#
KIRK: That's not so. He was my friend.#
KIRK: You have my sworn deposition.;#
KIRK: Timothy, I haven't seen you since the Vulcanian expedition. (no reply) Well, I see our graduating class from the Academy is well represented. Corrigan. Teller. How you doing, Mike?#
KIRK: Couple of days.#
KIRK: In a hurry to see me go?#
KIRK: You can talk plainer than that.#
KIRK: Go on. Finish. Ben was a friend of yours, and#
KIRK: Go on. I'm waiting to hear the rest.#
KIRK: What would be the point? You've already made up your minds. Excuse me, Bones.#
KIRK: Ready.#
KIRK: Yes. He was an instructor at the Academy when I was a midshipman, but that didn't stand in the way of our beginning a close friendship. His daughter Jamie, who was here last night, was named after me.#
KIRK: It's no secret. We were assigned to the same ship some years later. I relieved him on watch once and found a circuit open to the atomic matter piles that should've been closed. Another five minutes, it could have blown up the ship.#
KIRK: United Starship Republic, number 1371.#
KIRK: I closed the switch and logged the incident. He drew a reprimand and was sent to the bottom of the promotion list.#
KIRK: Yes. He had been at the Academy for an unusually long time as an instructor. As a result, he was late in being assigned to a starship. The delay, he felt, looked bad on his record. My action, he believed, made things worse.#
KIRK: Weather scan indicated an ion storm dead ahead. I sent Finney into the pod.;#
KIRK: His name was at the top of the duty roster.#
KIRK: He may have blamed me that he never rose to command a ship, but I don't assign jobs on the basis of who blames me. It was Finney's turn, and I assigned him. He had just checked in with me from the pod when we hit the leading edge of the storm. Not too bad at first. I signalled a Yellow Alert. Then we began encountering pressure, variant stress, force seven, the works. I finally signaled a Red Alert. Finney knew he had a matter of seconds. I gave him those seconds and more. But apparently it wasn't enough.#
KIRK: I don't know. There's been a mistake.#
KIRK: Mister Spock is running a survey right now, but the odds are next to impossible.#
KIRK: Is that the way you see it?#
KIRK: A physical breakdown. Possibly even mental collapse.#
KIRK: I'd be admitting a man died because#
KIRK: But if what you suspect is true, then I'm guilty. I should be punished.#
KIRK: By what, Commodore Stone?#
KIRK: That's as far as you go, sir. I'm telling you I was there on the Bridge. I know what happened. I know what I did.#
KIRK: So that's the way we do it now? Sweep it under the rug, and me along with it? Not on your life. I intend to fight.#
KIRK: Draw it? I demand it. And right now, Commodore Stone. Right now. Captain's Log, Stardate 2948.9. The officers who will comprise my court-martial board are proceeding to Starbase Eleven. Meanwhile, repairs on the Enterprise are almost complete.#
KIRK: Areel. Doctor McCoy said you were here. I should have felt it in the air, like static electricity.#
KIRK: You look marvellous. You haven't changed a bit.#
KIRK: Oh, you've heard about that, have you?#
KIRK: I remember. Let's forget it. We have a lot of lost time to make up for.#
KIRK: The confidence of an innocent man.#
KIRK: Look, Let's not talk shop.#
KIRK: I never could talk you into anything. All right. Fire away.#
KIRK: What other choice is there?#
KIRK: You, perhaps?#
KIRK: Well, a girl with your ability should be able to handle two cases at once.#
KIRK: You still haven't made any recommendation.#
KIRK: Areel, you still haven't told me how you know so much about what the prosecution's going to do.#
KIRK: Yes.  What is all this?#
KIRK: I hope I'm not crowding you.#
KIRK: Oh, I like them fine, but a computer takes less space.#
KIRK: Why not?;#
KIRK: And what would be the point?#
KIRK: You have to be either an obsessive crackpot who's escaped from his keeper or Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law.#
KIRK: I'm afraid so.#
KIRK: I have no objections, sir.#
KIRK: I do, sir.#
KIRK: Not guilty.#
KIRK: Yes, sir, there was.;#
KIRK: Firstly, I am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log. We were in an ion storm. Everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved. I was in command. The decisions were mine, no one else's. Charges of malice have been raised. There was no malice. Lieutenant Commander Finney was a member of my crew, and that's exactly the way he was treated. It has been suggested that I panicked on the bridge and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely. That is not so. You've heard some of the details of my record. This was not my first crisis. It was one of many. During it, I did what my experience and training required me to do. I took the proper steps in the proper order. I did exactly what had to be done, exactly when it should have been done.#
KIRK: Given the same circumstances I would do the same thing without hesitation, because the steps I took in the order I took them were absolutely necessary if I were to save my ship. And nothing is more important than my ship.#
KIRK: We'll need somebody in the pod for readings.#
KIRK: Post him.#
KIRK: Stand by on alert status, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Warp factor one, Mister Hanson.#
KIRK: Tie in.#
KIRK: Make it fast, Ben. I may have to go to Red Alert.#
KIRK: Hold our course, Mister Hanson.#
KIRK: Engineering, then ion pod.#
KIRK: One third more thrust.#
KIRK: Stand by to get out of there, Ben.#
KIRK: Steady as she goes, Mister Hanson.#
KIRK: But that's not the way it happened. Captain's Log, Stardate 2949.9. The evidence presented by the visual playback to my general court-martial was damning. I suspect even my attorney has begun to doubt me.#
KIRK: Are you suggesting that I did?#
KIRK: Two days ago, I would've staked anything on my judgment.#
KIRK: I spent my whole life training for decisions just like that one. My whole life. Is it possible that when the moment came? No. I know what I did. You can pull out if you want to.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: I'll tell you what you found. Nothing, right?#
KIRK: Not bitter enough to forget to thank you for your efforts.#
KIRK: No. It's not all bad, Mister Spock. Who knows. You may be able to beat your next captain at chess. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Jamie. This is Lieutenant Commander Finney's daughter.#
KIRK: It's too late for that, Jamie, but I'm glad you don't blame me anymore for what happened.#
KIRK: Don't say any more.#
KIRK: I know, and I thank you. I have to go and change. You ready?#
KIRK: I instituted a phase one search.#
KIRK: It's a painstaking, thorough attempt in and around the ship to find a man who's presumably injured and unable to respond.#
KIRK: I beg your pardon?#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Possibly.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, for the purposes of this experiment, it'll be necessary for all personnel, except for members of the court and the command crew, to leave the ship. I am ordering all others to report to the transporter room.#
KIRK: Our impulse engines have been shut down. We'll maintain orbit by momentum.#
KIRK: We hope to be finished long before that.#
KIRK: Ready, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster, we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power. The computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy? All right, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Turn it down a little. Gentlemen, that sound is caused by the heartbeats of all the people on board the ship. Doctor McCoy will use this white sound device to mask out each person's heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing.#
KIRK: That's all of us, except for crewman in the transporter room. Mister Spock, eliminate his heartbeat. That accounts for everyone.#
KIRK: Seal off B deck, sections 18Y through 23D.#
KIRK: It would seem so. Commodore, this is my problem. I'd appreciate it if no one left the bridge.#
KIRK: Ben.#
KIRK: Ben, where are you?#
KIRK: I'm glad you're alive.#
KIRK: Ben! Ben, it's not too late. We can help you.#
KIRK: Put the phaser down, Ben.#
KIRK: What about my ship?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, what's our orbit status?#
KIRK: Ben. Why kill innocent people?#
KIRK: I logged the mistake, Ben. Blame me, not them.#
KIRK: Is Jamie included in that deal?#
KIRK: She's on board by now. Yes. She's on board.#
KIRK: At the risk of sounding like a mystic, that depends on the stars.#
KIRK: I didn't have much of a chance to thank him.#
KIRK: I wouldn't be a bit surprised.#
KIRK: Let's try.  See? No change. Discipline goes on.#
KIRK: Goodbye, Areel. Better luck next time.#
KIRK: She's a very good lawyer.#
KIRK: We received a subspace message asking us to divert here immediately.#
KIRK: Mister Spock received a starbase transmission, a message from the former commander of the Enterprise, Fleet Captain Pike, urgently requesting that we divert here.#
KIRK: If my first officer states he received a transmission from#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: When he was promoted to Fleet Captain.#
KIRK: I took over the Enterprise from him. Spock served with him for several years.#
KIRK: Chris, if there's anything I can do for you.#
KIRK: Once more, Jose. Spock stated he received a message for us to come here. He entered same in his log. That's all the proof I require.#
KIRK: Then I suggest the record tapes have been deliberately changed. A computer expert can change record tapes, duplicate voices, say anything, say nothing.#
KIRK: If he had wanted to see Captain Pike he could have requested a leave. I would have granted it.#
KIRK: Who would want to divert us here? There's no trouble in the space sector we're patrolling now. No alien problems.#
KIRK: Helen described#
KIRK: Miss Piper, a Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist without breathing. That goes for his present commander as well as his past.#
KIRK: There's no way he could even have asked for that message to be sent?#
KIRK:  He keeps blinking no. No to what?#
KIRK: How long will he live?#
KIRK: He keeps blinking no.#
KIRK: Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?#
KIRK: What I mean is either a message was received. It was one of two things. Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone on board the ship lied about receiving it. Could that someone be Mister Spock?#
KIRK: He's also half human.#
KIRK: Someone's interfering with my command and my ship. I don't know who it is, but I mean to find out. Even you. If I thought you had the technical know-how I'd suspect you, but you don't. Spock does.#
KIRK: There's a false entry in the log right now which doesn't jibe with the established facts. How do you explain that.#
KIRK:  For eyes of Starfleet Command only.#
KIRK: What every ship Captain knows. General Order 7, no vessel under any condition, emergency or otherwise, is to visit Talos Four.#
KIRK: The Enterprise, commanded by Captain Christopher Pike.#
KIRK: Spock is headed for Talos Four, all right.#
KIRK: Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in!#
KIRK: Blast you any way. You had no right to come along.#
KIRK: Two hours of oxygen left.#
KIRK: Part of me is hoping the Enterprise won't come back for us. We step on that deck, Spock is finished. Court-martialed, disgraced.#
KIRK: Spock would have some logical reason for going there.#
KIRK: Accepting command. Where's Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Reverse power. Hold this position. Tell whoever gave those orders to report#
KIRK: Disengage computer control, Uhura.#
KIRK: Computer control, come in.#
KIRK: Disengage from helm.#
KIRK: This hearing is convened. Mister Spock, you're aware of your right to counsel of your choice?#
KIRK: Request denied.#
KIRK: A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command officers. Since there are only two of that rank available#
KIRK: Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.#
KIRK: By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish to present. Apparently what he had in mind.#
KIRK: Screen off. Chris, was that really you on the screen? That's impossible. Mister Spock, no vessel makes record tapes in that detail, that perfect. What were we watching?#
KIRK: I am forced to contest that, Commodore. I want to see more.#
KIRK: That has nothing to do with it.#
KIRK: Screen on, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: We still haven't heard the full story. I vote to continue.#
KIRK: Not a deadlock. There's still one member of the trial board to be heard from.#
KIRK: Yes. Captain's log supplemental. Mister Spock, on trial for mutiny, has forced the court to accept unusual evidence. On our monitor screen, the voyage of Captain Pike and the Enterprise to the one forbidden world in all the galaxy.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Plead signal for you, sir. Go ahead, Uhura.#
KIRK: Receiving transmissions from Talos Four? Then the images we've been seeing are#
KIRK: Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind?#
KIRK: Lock him up. To be concluded next week...#
KIRK: Anything from the landing party?#
KIRK: A kink in my back. (behind his back the Yeoman starts to massage it) That's it. A little higher, please. Push. Push hard. Dig it in there, Mister#
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. That's sufficient.#
KIRK: I have enough of that from Doctor McCoy, Yeoman. Thank you.#
KIRK: Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Captain's log. Stardate 3025 er, point 3. We are orbiting an uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region. A planet remarkably like Earth, or how we remember Earth to be. Park-like, beautiful, green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful. Almost too good to be true.#
KIRK: I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart. Dismissed.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first. Which section would you like to go with?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Yes. Open a channel, Uhura.#
KIRK: I hadn't planned to, Bones. Why?#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: That's pretty good. I got one for you. The rabbit was followed by a little blonde girl, right?#
KIRK: All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration. Captain out. That's a McCoy pill, with a little mystery sugar-coating. He wants to get me down there. I'm afraid I won't swallow it.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?#
KIRK: That's much too low a rating.#
KIRK: A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins. That man will go a shore on my orders. What's his name?#
KIRK: Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right?#
KIRK: Good. That should be sufficient. Beam it up to Mister Spock when you're ready, and start enjoying yourselves.#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: Restful. After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a place this beautiful exists.#
KIRK: McCoy! McCoy!#
KIRK: Bones, know any good rabbit jokes lately?#
KIRK: Footprints. Could be a rabbit. It would have to be an unusual creature to make this size tracks. What about Mister Sulu? Will he confirm what you saw?#
KIRK: Bridge, this is the Captain.#
KIRK: Has the first shore party beamed down yet?#
KIRK: Get this message to all shore parties. Stand by. No one is to leave the ship.#
KIRK: You're the doctor, Doctor. Can you explain this?#
KIRK: Neither can I. I admit it looks harmless. It probably is harmless. But before I bring my people down here, I want proof it's harmless. (They hear a gunshot. Kirk draws his phaser and they head off in the direction of the shot. More are fired.)#
KIRK: What do you think you're doing?#
KIRK: Where did you get it, Mister Sulu?#
KIRK:  Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: I'll hang on to it. The fresh air seems to have made you trigger-happy.#
KIRK: Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this planet?#
KIRK: I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but. Yeoman Barrows, you accompany Mister Sulu. Find out where those tracks came from. Doctor, you come with me back to the glade. I'd like another look at that area. (As they head back, an aerial comes up in front of our point of view and follows them.) KIRK: This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave.#
KIRK: How?#
KIRK: What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex?#
KIRK: I know the feeling very well. I had it at the Academy. An upper classman there. One practical joke after another, and always on me. My own personal devil. A guy by the name of Finnegan.#
KIRK: Serious? I'll make a confession, Bones. I was absolutely grim, which delighted Finnegan no end. He's the kind of guy to put a bowl of cold soup in your bed or a bucket of water propped on a half-open door. You never knew where he'd strike next. More tracks. Looks like your rabbit came from over there.#
KIRK: Yes. You follow the rabbit. I'll backtrack the girl. I'll meet you around the other side of the hill.#
KIRK: Finnegan? I can't believe it.#
KIRK: All right, let's try that one again. Go! (He just lays hands on Finnegan for a good fight, when they hear screams. Kirk runs off to investigate)#
KIRK: Yeoman Barrows. (They arrive on the scene to find Tonia disheveled, her uniform torn, hugging a tree) KIRK: What happened?#
KIRK: Who was?#
KIRK: Barrows, give me a report.#
KIRK: Are you sure you're not imagining all this?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu was with you. Where is he now?#
KIRK: Stay with her, Doctor.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu! Sulu! (An aerial comes up from a rock and monitors him as he runs along the path) KIRK: Mister Sulu! Sulu!#
KIRK: Sulu! (He picks an orange flower, and becomes wistful. And there she is, blonde and lovely, her dress half white, half black and roses.) KIRK: Ruth? Ruth.#
KIRK:  McCoy, do you read me? Ruth. Ruth, how can it be you? How could you possibly be here? You haven't aged. It's been fifteen years.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: No, but I'm sure he's all right.#
KIRK: Yes, I'm fine.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Rodriguez.#
KIRK: Don't you like birds, Mister Rodriguez?#
KIRK: Mister Rodriguez, have the search parties rendezvous at the glade. I'd like some answers to all this.#
KIRK: I don't want to.#
KIRK: You haven't told me. You haven't told me#
KIRK: Ruth.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Specify.#
KIRK: Can you pinpoint the source?#
KIRK: Keep me posted, Mister Spock. We'll continue our investigation down here. Captain out.#
KIRK: First there was McCoy's Alice in Wonderland where there was supposedly no animal life. And Sulu's gun where there's no refined metal detected. Rodriguez' birds. And then my, well, the two people I saw.#
KIRK: One hallucination flattened me with a clout on the jaw.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: McCoy. McCoy, do you read me? Kirk to McCoy. Come in.#
KIRK: A what?#
KIRK: I do. I've met some interesting personalities myself. Have you seen any of the others while I've been gone?#
KIRK: I hope he got through to everybody. Communications are almost out.#
KIRK: Trying to. Something's obstructing it. (finally the familiar shape fully materialises) Mister Spock, my orders were no one was to leave the ship.#
KIRK: Good. We can use your help.#
KIRK: Until we can find out what this is all about.#
KIRK: That way. Spread out. Let's find it.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Yeoman! We're in trouble. I need every crewman alert and thinking.#
KIRK: Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I will.#
KIRK: Tricorder?#
KIRK: Mister Spock. (Spock and Sulu swap places, handing over the tricorder) What do you make of that?#
KIRK: I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Are you saying this is a plant, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: By who? And why? And why these particular things?#
KIRK: McCoy's body?#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: McCoy's death is a scientific fact.#
KIRK: I was, I was thinking about the Academy. My days#
KIRK: Finnegan. Finnegan! What's been happening to my people?#
KIRK: Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem.#
KIRK: That's an order, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I want some answers.#
KIRK: Can you feel that?#
KIRK: Finnegan. One thing#
KIRK: Answers.#
KIRK: A lot of things. What's been happening to my people?#
KIRK: I'm not a plebe. This is today, fifteen years later. What are you doing here?#
KIRK: Yes, I enjoyed it. After all these years.  I did enjoy it. The one thing I wanted to do after all these years was to beat the tar out of Finnegan.#
KIRK: That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment.#
KIRK: Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about#
KIRK: Difficult.#
KIRK: Spock. (The tiger is behind them, the chain around it's neck tethering it to the spot clearly visible) KIRK: We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them. (They start to run back to the glade. The aircraft strafe them, Kirk elbows the Samurai out of his way)#
KIRK: Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows. Front and centre.#
KIRK: Don't ask any questions, Sulu. Face front, everyone. Don't talk. Don't breathe. Don't think. You're at attention. Concentrate on that and only that. Concentrate.#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: You know my name?#
KIRK: Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through?#
KIRK: Yes, play, Mister Sulu. The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.#
KIRK: But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.#
KIRK: You say your people built all this. Who are you? What planet are you from?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: No, everything is in order, Lieutenant. Stand by.#
KIRK: Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Commence transporting shore leave parties. Tell them to prepare for the best shore leave they've ever had. Kirk out.#
KIRK: No, Mister Spock. I'll go. You. (then he sees Ruth walking towards the group) On the other hand, I'll stay for a day or two.#
KIRK: Yes, we did, Mister Spock. I think we did.#
KIRK: Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Forward readings, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. Colony Beta Six wants their supplies. Let's get across this void in a hurry.#
KIRK: Sunlight, palm trees. We're nine hundred light years from that kind of desert, Bones.#
KIRK: Something, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Can you verify that, Navigator?#
KIRK: Put it on visual.#
KIRK: And yet, here it is. No time to investigate. Science stations, gather data for computer banks. Uhura, notify the discovery on subspace radio.#
KIRK: Let's get out of its range. Veer forty degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Sulu!#
KIRK: What happened? Fill me in.#
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise.#
KIRK: Who are you? Where do you come from? General Trelane, retired. At your service, sirs. My home is your home.#
KIRK: Then you've been looking in on the doings nine hundred years past.#
KIRK: General Trelane.#
KIRK: For what purpose have you imprisoned us here?#
KIRK: Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest. When we do battle, it is only because we have no choice.#
KIRK: I must ask you to let us go back to our ship.#
KIRK: Not yet. Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle.#
KIRK: This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator. Doctor McCoy, our medical officer. Mister Sulu, our helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist.#
KIRK: Who will you start with, my crew? Are we your next targets?#
KIRK: That's correct.#
KIRK: Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise.#
KIRK: This drawing room, did you create it by rearranging matter on this planet?#
KIRK: I see. How did you manage#
KIRK: Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here.#
KIRK: Not alive?#
KIRK: Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present day Earth without taking into account the time differential. Whatever we're dealing with, he certainly isn't all knowledgeable. He makes mistakes.#
KIRK: Trelane, we haven't planned#
KIRK: If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty too. Our ship has need of us. We have tasks to perform.#
KIRK: For how long?#
KIRK: Until what is over?#
KIRK: Trelane, even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing us.#
KIRK: There are four hundred men and women aboard that ship.#
KIRK:  No.#
KIRK: This game has gone on long enough. Those are crucial operating personnel. You can't#
KIRK: It means, Trelane, the party's over, thanks to Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Everyone to stations. Report, Mister Spock. How were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field?#
KIRK: Prepare to warp out of here at once. Maximum speed.#
KIRK: Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines. We're going to put a hundred million miles between us and that madman.#
KIRK: Trelane.#
KIRK: On the contrary. I commend his action.#
KIRK: Get off my ship.#
KIRK: We're not going anywhere.#
KIRK: DeSalle.#
KIRK: Trelane, let him go.#
KIRK: This is General Trelane.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura of communications.#
KIRK: No doubt.#
KIRK:  Yeoman Teresa Ross. I believe you have met our science officer Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Until we can think our way out. Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality.#
KIRK: You don't find this unexpected, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: And if he's fallible, he can't be all powerful. Which means he has something helping him.#
KIRK: A machine? A device? Something which does these things for him.#
KIRK: That mirror. It's part of his audience, his ego. He never wanders from it.#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: What about it?#
KIRK: No, no, Mister Spock, that's not the reason. What kind of a machine could do these things?#
KIRK: Good. I agree. That leaves me free .#
KIRK: If I'm not mistaken, Mister Spock, I think I can turn his lights off at the source.  Don't be too upset by what you see, gentlemen. After all, his actions are those of an immature, unbalanced mind.#
KIRK: You only heard part of it. I just started.#
KIRK: Yes. I want you to leave my crewmen alone. I want you to leave my crewwomen alone too.  You're not to dance with him. I don't like it.#
KIRK:  I don't want you accepting his gifts, either.#
KIRK: I don't care what you believe, just keep your hands off her!#
KIRK: I've had enough of your insulting attentions to her.#
KIRK: If it's fighting that you want,  you may have it.#
KIRK: If you have the courage.#
KIRK: Are you ready?#
KIRK: Enough talk. Let's get on with it.#
KIRK: We shoot together.#
KIRK: All right.#
KIRK: Try to contact the ship.#
KIRK: Go on, Trelane. Look at it. It's over. Your power is blanked out. You're finished.#
KIRK: Trelane! Everyone, we're getting out of here. Now. This is the Captain. Commence beaming up. Maximum speed.#
KIRK: Set course for Colony Beta Six.#
KIRK: Full power acceleration from orbit, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Not yet. They may trace our beam. Wait until we're well out of range.#
KIRK: We can take an educated guess. At the point we entered their solar system.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: Yes, I think you might. Turn in your glass slippers. The ball is over.#
KIRK: Hard to believe it ever happened.#
KIRK: Hard to port, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Gothos? Mister Sulu, have we been going in circles?#
KIRK: Hard over, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: With us as the mouse.#
KIRK: Ninety degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Ninety degrees sub-port, Mister Sulu. Adjust.#
KIRK: Decelerate into orbit. Prepare transporter room.#
KIRK: Yes, I am, Doctor McCoy. I am going to see our playful Mister Trelane and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship. Stand by communications. Mister Spock. If you don't receive a message from me within the hour, leave the vicinity at once. No turning back.#
KIRK: Trelane.#
KIRK: I've had enough of your games.#
KIRK: I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane.#
KIRK: I've come for one purpose. To get back my ship.#
KIRK: We've made you angry with our will to survive, haven't we?#
KIRK: Then vent your anger on me alone. I was the one who led the others. I was the one who shot out your mirror machine.#
KIRK: I took that chance. I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong.#
KIRK: Yes, anything! Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey. You pompous#
KIRK: Those people have done you no harm.#
KIRK: We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement.#
KIRK: I'm glad you weren't disappointed.#
KIRK: Trelane, if you think I'm going to cheerfully and obediently stick my head in that noose#
KIRK: That's your problem, Trelane. Everything is easy. It's given you a bad habit. You're not aware of it, but you have it. You don't think, Trelane. That's your problem. You miss opportunities, like your anger before and mine right now. Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why? Because you're a bumbling, inept fool.#
KIRK: Here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique, and you're wasting it. You want to commit murder? Go ahead, but where's the sport in a simple hanging?#
KIRK: Yes. The terror of murder. The suspense. The fun.#
KIRK: A personal conflict between us. Not like the duel before, but the real thing. The stakes, a human life. Mine.#
KIRK: That's the idea.#
KIRK: Yes, but you can do better than that. There's still not enough sport in just killing me with a sword.#
KIRK: It strikes me very well. But you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane. Why not up the stakes?#
KIRK: Yes. While we're playing our game, free my ship. Let it continue on its way. In return, I'll give you a contest you'll remember.#
KIRK: Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go.#
KIRK: Enterprise. Enterprise, can you hear me? (Kirk takes an opportunity to get Trelane's sword off him, but when he takes a swing at his foe he just disappears and reappears again)#
KIRK: Enterprise. Enterprise.#
KIRK: Remember, Trelane. You promised to let my ship go.#
KIRK: You haven't won, Trelane.#
KIRK: But you haven't won anything.#
KIRK: No! Does it still taste as sweet?#
KIRK: But I'm not defeated.#
KIRK: You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane.#
KIRK: In fact, you've got a lot to learn about everything, haven't you?#
KIRK: Who are you? Who is Trelane?#
KIRK: Captain to Enterprise. Captain to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Beam me up, Mister Spock. We're free to go.#
KIRK: Normal orbit approach procedures, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Still thinking about Trelane, is that it?#
KIRK: God of war, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Then a small boy, and a very naughty one at that.#
KIRK: Then he was a very strange small boy. One the other hand, he was probably doing things comparable to the same mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy.#
KIRK: Yes. Dipping little girls' curls in inkwells. Stealing apples from the neighbours' trees. Tying cans on#
KIRK: Forgive me, Mister Spock. I should have known better.#
KIRK: You'll enjoy Commodore Travers. He sets a good table.#
KIRK: Probably. Rank hath its privileges.#
KIRK: Scotty. Kirk here.#
KIRK: Good, Commodore. We're on our way.#
KIRK: We'll beam down immediately, Commodore. Kirk out.#
KIRK: This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of now here. He probably wants additional advice.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Red alert.#
KIRK: Cestus Three has been destroyed.#
KIRK: Full alert. Tricorder readings, Mister Spock. Life detection.#
KIRK: Faked. All this happened several days ago. (to a man in a yellow shirt) Lang, over there. Look for survivors. Kelowitz, that way.  O'Herlihy, stick with me.#
KIRK: Come on, Bones. Captain's log, Stardate 3045.6 The Enterprise has responded to a call from Earth observation outpost on Cestus Three. On landing, we have discovered that the outpost has been destroyed.#
KIRK: Keep him alive, Bones. I want to know what's been happening here.#
KIRK: Survivors?#
KIRK: Where?#
KIRK: O'Herlihy. (Kirk sends his security guard off to look, but he hasn't gone far before he stands up and says)#
KIRK: Cover! Kirk to Enterprise, lock on transporters. Beam us up.#
KIRK: Keep those screens up. Fire all phasers.#
KIRK: Take all action necessary to protect the ship. We'll hold out here.#
KIRK: Keep those screens up. Worry about us when the ship is safe.#
KIRK: If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll be open to phaser attack.#
KIRK: We're stuck with it, Mister Spock. We'll have to make do with what we've got. (Carrying the survivor, the away team heads into better shelter - Life Support Ramp 3 Level K according to the sign) KIRK: Kelowitz, Lang, flank out. Lay down fire on co-ordinates Mister Spock gave you. Even if you don't see them. Keep your heads down.#
KIRK: We're helpless down here. And the Enterprise#
KIRK: It's my ship, Mister Spock. I should be there. We can't even get at them.#
KIRK: Can you remember the layout of this place? The arsenal?#
KIRK: I'll risk it. (He does an heroic zigzag run amongst the incoming explosions, takes shelter behind an oil drum and calls Enterprise) KIRK: Kirk here. Report.#
KIRK: Never mind about me. What about the ship?#
KIRK: Arm your photon torpedoes.#
KIRK: Any identification on the attacking vessel?#
KIRK: Sulu. Sulu, our communications are being interfered with. (An explosion makes him run further on into an old bomb crater) Now get this straight.#
KIRK: Never mind about me. Protect my ship!#
KIRK: Good. Contact me when you can. Kirk out.#
KIRK: We'll see how ingenious they are. Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher. Lang!#
KIRK: Sulu's taken her out of orbit.#
KIRK: Did you see them?#
KIRK: An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz. Where do you think they are?#
KIRK: It'll be a lot closer to them. Stand clear. (He drops a blue ball into the launcher, it zooms off and there is a blinding flash and bang. Silence reigns until Kirk's communicator beeps.) KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Lock on to the alien, Mister Sulu. I don't want to lose her.#
KIRK: I want a search party of thirty medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors. Notify the transporter room. Lock onto us. We're beaming up.#
KIRK: Can you tell me what happened?#
KIRK: Yes, I know.#
KIRK: Easy. Easy.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus Three. One for the Enterprise to go there, and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.#
KIRK: It was a trap. Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus Three, getting us and our whole crew to come ashore.#
KIRK: The reason is crystal clear. The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation. Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open.#
KIRK: I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.#
KIRK: How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mister Spock. The threat is clear and immediate. Invasion.#
KIRK: I intend to. If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us. Captain to helmsman.#
KIRK: Is the alien still making warp five?#
KIRK: Initiate warp six.#
KIRK: Overtake. Phaser banks, lock on to the enemy vessel. Stand by for firing orders. All hands, this is the Captain. We are going into battle. All hands, battle stations. Red alert. I repeat, red alert. This is no drill. This is no drill. Captain's log, Stardate 3046.2. We are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus Three.#
KIRK: Mister DePaul.#
KIRK: Position.#
KIRK: All scanners lock into computer banks. I want a complete record of this. Mister Spock, what do we have on this general area?#
KIRK: Anything on intelligent life forms?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, status, alien vessel.#
KIRK: Warp factor seven.#
KIRK: Something the matter, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. I mean to catch them.#
KIRK: They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Of course.#
KIRK: Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations.#
KIRK: There's no time for that. It's a matter of policy. Out here, we're the only policemen around. And a crime has been committed. Do I make myself clear?#
KIRK: I'm delighted, Mister Spock. Report, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Warp factor eight.#
KIRK: Captain to phaser banks. All components at battle ready. All banks primed.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Good. Mister DePaul.#
KIRK: Our position.#
KIRK: Is it on the alien's course?#
KIRK: By the alien ship?#
KIRK: Any interference? Resistance?#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?#
KIRK: Yes, what is it?#
KIRK: He may be turning to fight.#
KIRK: Are you sure?#
KIRK: Then we've got them. Go to Red Alert. Prepare to fire phaser banks. Sensors, lock on. Mister Sulu, continue closing. Mister Spock, lock phasers into computer. Computers will control attack.#
KIRK: From warp eight? Have you lost your mind?#
KIRK: Mister Scott, report.#
KIRK: Phaser banks. Report.#
KIRK: Damage Control, report.#
KIRK: Tractor beam?#
KIRK: This is Kirk.#
KIRK: I don't understand.#
KIRK: What makes you think you can interfere with#
KIRK: Just a minute#
KIRK: This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Who ever finds this please get it to Starfleet Command. I'm engaged in personal combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn. (We see that the recording is also being transmitted and translated by the Gorn's device too)#
KIRK: The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons. There's very little here. Scrub brush, rocks, an abundance of mineral deposits, but no weapons in the conventional sense. Still, I need to find one. Bare-handed against the Gorn, I have no chance.#
KIRK: A large deposit of diamonds on the surface. Perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe. Beautifully crystallized and pointed, but too small to be useful as a weapon. An incredible fortune in stones yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser, or a good solid club. Yet the Metrons said there would be weapons, if I could find them. Where? What kind? (From his vantage point on the ridge, Kirk watches the Gorn at work, then spots a lone rock neatly balanced on a pinnacle above his adversary. He pushes it over, the Gorn looks up, then we get the cloud of dust and a view of the reptile under the rock, lying still. Confident, Kirk comes down to check on his kill, just in time to see the Gorn move, grasp his stone dagger, and get up again. The rock continues on its way down the slope. The mammal runs away, straight into reptiles trap of vines and rocks. Now Kirk is pinned under a boulder, and at his enemy's mercy. But the Gorn has to move the boulder to be able to stab him, so once again Kirk is able to dodge away, albeit with a limp.#
KIRK: This may be my last entry. I am almost exhausted. Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned I have very little time left. Native sulphur, diamonds. This place is a mineralogist's dream. Yet there is something about sulphur. Something very old. Something? If only I could remember.#
KIRK: No. No, I won't kill you. Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost.#
KIRK: No, I won't kill him! Do you hear? You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else! (The Gorn disappears, and a young blond boy in a white shift appears instead.) KIRK: You're a Metron?#
KIRK: You seem more like a boy.#
KIRK: How?#
KIRK: What happened to the Gorn?#
KIRK: No. That won't be necessary. We can talk. Maybe reach an agreement.#
KIRK: I don't know. I don't know. All right, everybody. Back to your posts. Let's get out of here.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Don't try and figure it out, Mister Sulu. Just plot a course for us back to Cestus Three.#
KIRK: We're a most promising species, Mister Spock, as predators go. Did you know that?#
KIRK: I don't. Not anymore. And maybe in a thousand years or so, we'll be able to prove it. Never mind, Mister Spock. It doesn't make much sense to me either. Take us back to where we're supposed to be, Mister Sulu. Warp factor one.#
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Photographic section, begin scanning. Tie in to visual section 988-TG, computer bank 22. Kirk out. About four more orbits ought to do it, Mister Lesley. That'll wrap it up. Lay in a course for Starbase 200.#
KIRK: Mister Spock!#
KIRK: What was that?#
KIRK: I want facts, not poetry.#
KIRK: That's impossible. What you're describing#
KIRK: All stations to immediate alert status. Stand by.#
KIRK: You just did a complete life survey five minutes ago. How are you just picking it up now?#
KIRK: Well, what is it, this object? Its physical makeup?#
KIRK: And its appearance coincided with this cosmic winking-out? SPOCK; Almost to the second. KIRK: Explanation.#
KIRK: Speculation. Could this being present any danger to the ship?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, notify Security to have an armed detachment of men ready to beam down with us. Let's go. Any word comes through from Starfleet Command, pipe it down immediately. Communications, priority one. Captain's log, stardate 3087.6. While investigating an uncharted planet, the Enterprise and at least this entire quadrant of space, has been subjected to violent, unexplained stress and force. Sensors have reported the presence of a human being on the planet below who might be connected with the phenomenon. With my first officer and a security team, I have set out in search of him.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: You have a talent for understatement, Lieutenant. Without full crystal power, our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours. Re-amplify immediately.#
KIRK: Any further magnetic disturbance?#
KIRK: Nothing?#
KIRK: Keep checking.#
KIRK: Repeat.#
KIRK: Invasion status. All hands, this is the Captain. Battle stations. I repeat, battle stations. This is no drill.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Yes, Doctor, quickly.#
KIRK: I'll talk to him later. Thank you. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Kirk here. Enterprise standing by, Commodore.#
KIRK: Yes, sir.#
KIRK: Thank you, sir. I have considered all the alternatives. My best guess is it could be a prelude to invasion.#
KIRK: I see. You mean, we're the bait.#
KIRK: Thank you, sir.  Maintain alert status at all battle stations.#
KIRK: From the top, Mister Spock. First, the phenomenon came from the planet below. Secondly, the danger is apparently real and imminent.#
KIRK: Yes. Meanwhile, I'll talk to our unexpected guest. Maybe he can provide some answers.#
KIRK: You say this one man#
KIRK: Thing destroyed your entire civilisation.#
KIRK: How did you escape?#
KIRK: Before we picked you up, our ship sustained a number of incredible effects.#
KIRK: Is he the thing that attacked you?#
KIRK: We don't have any other facts, any information.#
KIRK: My only cause is the safety of my ship and the mission we're on. You'll beam down with me and I'll check your story out.#
KIRK: Spock, find anything?#
KIRK: According to him, there's a creature of some sort down here, a humanoid.#
KIRK: Let's have it. The truth this time. (Another one of those 'nebula overlay' events happens, and Lazarus starts shouting then runs off.)#
KIRK: Can you identify that?#
KIRK: Lazarus! You stay here. All personnel, security red.#
KIRK: Lazarus, what happened?#
KIRK: Let's get out of here.#
KIRK: Let's get back to the ship.#
KIRK: Any luck?#
KIRK: If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said#
KIRK: Hard to believe.#
KIRK: But the rest of his story seems to fit. His wounds testify to an apparent confrontation with something.#
KIRK: Assuming there is a humanoid, a something, how does he do it? He has no weapons, no power.#
KIRK: You tell me. That's why you brought me down here, isn't it.#
KIRK: Right.#
KIRK: Bones, I've got a lot of things to do. Get to the point.#
KIRK: Where is he?#
KIRK: Lazarus, are you all right?#
KIRK: No. I have a ship's physician with a strange sense of humour.#
KIRK: Go.#
KIRK: Find something?#
KIRK: On my way. Lazarus, you're with me. Bones, if I had time, I'd laugh.#
KIRK: How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before?#
KIRK: Another riddle? First Doctor McCoy, then you?#
KIRK: But it is there.#
KIRK: A what?#
KIRK: What do the crystals have to do with it? All they show us the point of radiation.#
KIRK: Out of the question. Those crystals are the very heart of the power of my ship.#
KIRK: How? Now you tell me how. All I've heard is double-talk, lies, threats, accusations that don't hold water. Now you tell me, how it presents a danger to my ship?#
KIRK: Don't threaten me, Lazarus.#
KIRK: Fact. You said you needed the crystals. Fact. An hour after you said you must have them, they were missing. Fact. Two of my crewmen were attacked.#
KIRK: How'd this beast get aboard my ship?#
KIRK: No. He didn't transport up. A report would've been made.#
KIRK: Sit down. The crystals certainly aren't here. There's an unexplained radiation source on the planet. Obviously some connection. We'll check it out. Organise a search party immediately. Mister Lazarus will beam down with us.#
KIRK: You may not have reason to thank me, depending on what we find.#
KIRK: I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship. Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise.#
KIRK: I want every inch of this terrain checked. Look for footprints, movement, anything. Call out if you spot anything. Don't be afraid to use your weapons. (The entire party leave the little spaceship. The Starfleet group splits into two and take different lines along a rocky outcrop. Lazarus heads off on his own and has one of his nebula moments. There's a fight in negative space and then it's over again. Kirk sends his two security men on ahead, and for some reason Lazarus decides to climb down a cliff face. He dislodges a rock and it goes tumbling. Lazarus calls out, then follows it.)#
KIRK: You saved my life down there. I want to thank you.#
KIRK: I have some questions I want to ask you.#
KIRK: It's necessary.#
KIRK: This is a computer report of the evidence you gave at your first screening. It calls you a liar, Lazarus. For one thing, there's no planet at the location you said you came from. There never has been. If you want help from us, you'd better start telling the truth.#
KIRK: Try us.#
KIRK: I'll have the truth now.#
KIRK: What are you saying?#
KIRK: And this thing you search for is a time traveler, too?#
KIRK: Lazarus, you're hurt. I know. I sympathise, but I've got four hundred and thirty other men to worry about. Now where are those crystals?#
KIRK: Dismissed.#
KIRK: Sometimes pain can drive a man harder than pleasure. I'm sure you know that, Doctor.#
KIRK: What have we got, Mister Spock? A magnetic effect which produces a winking-out phenomenon. A mysterious, unidentified source of radiation on the planet. Lazarus, a walking powder keg. Your rip in the universe. A so-called murdering humanoid.#
KIRK: But by using those instruments you were unable to identify the source of the radiation on the planet.#
KIRK: Are the instruments in order?#
KIRK: Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative. The source of radiation is not from our universe.#
KIRK: Outside? Yes, that would explain a lot. Another universe, perhaps in another dimension, occupying the same space at the same time.#
KIRK: All right. What would happen if another universe, say a minus universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours?#
KIRK: Which is what we've been experiencing. The point where they come into contact, couldn't that be described as a hole?#
KIRK: Or what is outside to enter. The invasion that Commodore Barstow suspected.#
KIRK: But a small scale invasion, Mister Spock. What is your analysis of the mental state of Lazarus?#
KIRK: Yes, two men. Different, but identical. And a hole in the universe. No, not a hole, A door.#
KIRK: Take a look at Lazarus. One minute he's at the point of death, the next he's alive, well, strong as a bull.#
KIRK: Which is physically impossible for one man.#
KIRK: What's going on? This leaping from universe to universe. This wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilisations What's the purpose?#
KIRK: I don't follow you.#
KIRK: Do you know what you're saying? Matter and antimatter have a tendency to cancel each other out. violently.#
KIRK: Like Lazarus. Identical. Like both Lazarus', only one is matter and the other antimatter. If they meet.#
KIRK: Of everything that exists, everywhere.#
KIRK: All available personnel, on the double. Spock, with me.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: He's probably beaming down with the crystals right now. I'm going after him. You organise a security detail. Follow me as soon as you can.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Lazarus.#
KIRK: No, him.#
KIRK: Not completely. This is a parallel universe?#
KIRK: Antimatter?#
KIRK: And if identical particles meet#
KIRK: He has two more.#
KIRK: Exactly what did I pass through?#
KIRK: This corridor, is it what caused the magnetic effect, the winking out phenomenon?#
KIRK: And the universe is safe.#
KIRK: Surely Lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet face to face outside the corridor.#
KIRK: So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster. The creature.#
KIRK: I understand. What do you want me to do?#
KIRK: You can't hold him forever.#
KIRK: If I destroy his ship, won't yours also be destroyed?#
KIRK: And your door will be closed.#
KIRK: You'll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever. At each other's throats throughout time.#
KIRK: I'm ready.#
KIRK: Stand back. (But Lazarus has him in a bear hug, and they struggle together for a while until Kirk finally gets the upper-hand again.)#
KIRK: I must destroy that ship completely.#
KIRK: And what of Lazarus?#
KIRK: Activate phaser banks.#
KIRK: Stand by to fire.#
KIRK: Fire phasers. (A sustained burst hits the little saucer, while the two Lazarus' wrestle in non-space. Finally it disappears.) KIRK: All right, Mister Lesley, let's get out of here. Ahead warp factor one.#
KIRK: Everything's all right, Mister Spock, for us.#
KIRK: There is, of course, no escape. How would it be? Trapped forever with a raging madman at your throat until time itself came to a stop? For eternity. How would it be?#
KIRK: For you and me. But what of Lazarus? What of Lazarus?#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Auxiliaries?#
KIRK: This is the Captain. Damage control parties on all decks, check in. All departments tie in with the record computer. Report casualties and operational readiness to the First Officer. Kirk out. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Control. I want them alerted to the position of that black star that's in the area of Starbase 9.#
KIRK: Orbit where?#
KIRK: Screen on.#
KIRK: Give us some altitude, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Put it on audio.#
KIRK: Manned Moon shot? That was in the late 1960s.#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, can you gain altitude faster? I want to outdistance him.#
KIRK: Scotty, activate tractor beam. Lock onto that aircraft and hold it out there.#
KIRK: Try and beam that pilot aboard. Take over, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Welcome aboard the Enterprise.#
KIRK: That's right. You can step off the transporter#
KIRK: Relax, Captain, you're among friends. I'm Captain James T. Kirk.#
KIRK: All in good time, Captain. Meanwhile, let me apologise for bringing you aboard the ship so abruptly, but it couldn't be helped. I didn't know that your craft couldn't stand up to our tractor beam.#
KIRK: We'll tell you what we decide to tell you in a few moments. In the meantime, relax. You're our guest. I have a feeling you'll find it interesting.#
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Affirmative. We have the pilot aboard. I'll be right up. Kirk out. Follow me.#
KIRK: Morning.  Captain.#
KIRK: Crewman.#
KIRK: Bridge.#
KIRK: There are only twelve like it in the fleet.#
KIRK: We're a combined service, Captain. Our authority is the United Earth Space Probe Agency.#
KIRK: This is very difficult to explain. We're from your future. A time warp placed us here. It was an accident.#
KIRK: Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer, Lieutenant Commander Spock.#
KIRK: Feel free to look around, Captain. Don't touch anything, but I think you'll find it interesting.#
KIRK: Very well, Mister Spock. Anything else on your mind?#
KIRK: What about him?#
KIRK: Your logic can be most annoying.#
KIRK: That flight suit must be uncomfortable.  Why don't you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable? Then I want to meet you and him in my quarters.#
KIRK: Computer on. Record.#
KIRK: Come.#
KIRK: Captain's log, supplemental. Engineering Officer Scott informs warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and reenergised.#
KIRK: Computer, you will not address me in that manner. Compute.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired.#
KIRK: I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate.#
KIRK: I'm afraid you'll have to. We can't send you back.#
KIRK: It's not the transporter. It's you. You know what the future looks like. If anybody else finds out, they could change the course of it, destroy it.#
KIRK: I'd report, If I could. We can't take the risk.#
KIRK: I'm sorry.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: But what, Scotty?#
KIRK: Yes, Scotty. Carry on.#
KIRK: Maintenance note. My recording computer has a serious malfunction. Recommend it either be corrected or scrapped. Compute.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. Report to my quarters. I'll contact Captain Christopher.#
KIRK: Captain Christopher. Captain Christopher? Security, this is the Captain.#
KIRK: He tried to escape. I know how he feels, but I can't send him back with what he knows.#
KIRK: Yes. But we're not in that position yet.#
KIRK: And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong. We're roughly about the same age, but in our society he'd be useless. Archaic.#
KIRK: Now you're sounding like Spock.#
KIRK: Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children?#
KIRK: You all right?#
KIRK: You said you had some additional information, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Well, that's it, isn't it? We'll have to find some way of#
KIRK: That means those search parties will be crawling all over that wreckage.#
KIRK: If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sun dogs, explainable things. At least publicly.#
KIRK: What about our problem, Mister Spock? Any ideas on how to get us back to our own time?#
KIRK: We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos. If the Captain feels duty bound to report what he saw, there won't be any evidence to support him.#
KIRK: Perhaps.#
KIRK: No, Captain. Thank you, but if anything should go wrong, you might get hurt. We couldn't risk that. Neither could you or your son.#
KIRK: Primitive computer. I've seen them demonstrated in museums.#
KIRK: I don't intend to start it.#
KIRK: What was what?#
KIRK: Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we have another problem. Captain 's Log, Stardate 3113.9. First Officer Spock recording. Due to an unfortunate accident, we have taken aboard another unwanted passenger.#
KIRK: Your surprise package is an Air Police sergeant from the base.#
KIRK: Kirk out. What was the chronometer reading when we first sighted Christopher's jet?#
KIRK: Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? Get them all. (They leave the room and head off down the corridor to the photo section)#
KIRK: We'll try the darkroom.#
KIRK: Yes, that's it. That's all of them. Signal Mister Spock that we're almost ready to beam up. I'll make a check of the files just in case.#
KIRK: What other one?#
KIRK: No, no, no. Just me. Besides, could anyone get out of here without your seeing them?#
KIRK: Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me.#
KIRK: I popped in out of thin air.#
KIRK: No, Colonel. I know it's no game.#
KIRK: For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk.#
KIRK: I told you, you wouldn't believe me.#
KIRK: Colonel, would you mind being careful with that?#
KIRK: Of some kind.#
KIRK: If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one. A big one.#
KIRK: This little thing? Just something I slipped on.#
KIRK: Did I sabotage something?#
KIRK: Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all.#
KIRK: That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered.#
KIRK: All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri. A beautiful place. You ought to see it.#
KIRK: That ought to be just about right.#
KIRK: Yes, I do. What's he doing here?#
KIRK: I see. No harm done. Mister Sulu, did you check out those tapes?#
KIRK: All they have is a mystery and no answers. Mister Sulu, signal the Transporter Chief. Four to beam up.#
KIRK: Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake.#
KIRK: You can't explain your presence on the base.#
KIRK: You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way.#
KIRK: Four to beam up, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: You won't have anything to remember, because it never would have happened.#
KIRK: Helm control?#
KIRK: Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance. Especially if one is all you have. Assume your stations.#
KIRK: Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Take a good look around, Captain. You made it here ahead of all of them.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain Christopher, you only have about fifteen years, so you'd better hurry.#
KIRK: Now, Mister Sulu.  More power, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Do you have the chronometer reading and the co-ordinates to return Captain Christopher and the guard?#
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room. Captain Christopher. {Transporter room]#
KIRK: We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain. Are you ready?#
KIRK: Our pleasure, Captain. Bridge out.#
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room. Prepare to energise.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energise.#
KIRK: Energise. (The sergeant is beamed into himself as he is about to look through the glass door of the Statistical Services Division. There's no one there, so he continues on his round.)#
KIRK: What's our reading, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Bridge to engineering. Begin full braking power.#
KIRK: No choice, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Never mind, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Mister Scott is still with us.#
KIRK: Open a channel, Uhura.#
KIRK: Starfleet Control, this is the Enterprise. Captain Kirk speaking.#
KIRK: Starfleet Control, repeating message. The Enterprise is home. Kirk out.#
KIRK: What is it, Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Transporter room, lock onto Sulu and O'Neil. Beam up immediately.#
KIRK: Sulu, what is it? Where's Lieutenant O'Neil?#
KIRK: Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he?#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: Sulu, take it easy.#
KIRK: Sit down.  What happened?#
KIRK: Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he?#
KIRK: Materialisation completed. Kirk out. (A man walks slowly past them, hand on his heart and smile on his face. He bows politely and carries on his way.)#
KIRK: Like Sulu. If everybody on this planet is like him. Let's go.#
KIRK: Joy to you.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: This Festival, it starts at six o'clock?#
KIRK: Let's get out of here.#
KIRK: Yes, that's right. We're from the valley.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: We heard that you might have rooms for us.#
KIRK: We have no plans to attend the Festival, sir.#
KIRK: I'd like to hear more about this Festival, and Landru.#
KIRK: What about Landru? (Outside are scenes of rioting, willful destruction of property, random violence and lust. Reger leaves the group, unseen to us.)#
KIRK: Landru. My guess is we have until morning. Let's put the time to good use. Doctor, do atmospheric readings to determine whether there's anything in the air to account for all this. Mister Lindstrom, correlate all that you've seen with any other sociological parallels, if any. Mister Spock, you and I have some serious thinking to do. When we leave here tomorrow morning, I want to have a plan of action. (Kirk, as sixth man in the group, didn't get a bunk bed or chair to sleep on. When the town clock strikes 6 am, everybody outside stops and then goes on their placid way as if nothing had happened.) KIRK: Spock. Spock, Lindstrom. Doc.#
KIRK: He'll give her a shot. It'll calm her down. Trust us.#
KIRK: What about Landru? Who is he?#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: What if we are?#
KIRK: We can take care of ourselves.#
KIRK: What do you mean, absorbed?#
KIRK: We're not going anywhere.#
KIRK: I said we're not going anywhere.#
KIRK: Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action.#
KIRK: Why did you kill that man?#
KIRK: You tell Landru that we'll come in our own time and that we'll speak to him. (Kirk takes the stave from the lawgiver, and hands it to Spock for inspection.)#
KIRK: Where to?#
KIRK: Quite a festival they had.#
KIRK: What do you make of all this?#
KIRK: Now they're back to normal.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Phasers on stun. Which way, Reger?#
KIRK: We'll handle Landru, Just get us out of this.#
KIRK: I don't want to hurt them. Warn them back.#
KIRK: Phasers on stun, wide field. Fire.#
KIRK: Fire.#
KIRK: Security.#
KIRK: Lieutenant O'Neil. He's one of our men.#
KIRK: Bring him along.#
KIRK: We still don't know what's happened to the Archons. Which way? Bring him along.#
KIRK: A lighting panel.#
KIRK: Before Landru? How long ago was that?#
KIRK: But not inconsistent with what we've seen. Security.#
KIRK: Those staffs. Hollow tubes. Antennae for some sort of broadcast power. What is it, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Absorbed?#
KIRK: What others?#
KIRK: Who?#
KIRK: Give him a shot. Keep him asleep. Reger, I want some answers. This underground. If Landru is so powerful, how do you survive?#
KIRK: The Archons. Tell me about them.#
KIRK: Pulled them down from the skies? A starship? Mister Spock, those power readings you took, are they?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise, come in.#
KIRK: Orbit condition.#
KIRK: Keep your shield up. Do everything you can to maintain orbit. We'll try and locate the source of the beam and stop it here.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: But beautiful, Mister Spock, with no apparatus at this end.#
KIRK: You are holding my ship. I demand that you release it.#
KIRK: We mean you no harm. Ours is a mission of peace and good will.#
KIRK: Put that away. Landru, listen to me.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Wake up. Mister Lesley.#
KIRK: He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Mister O'Neil.#
KIRK: Where is here?#
KIRK: No. All our phasers are gone. I checked. That's locked.#
KIRK: Enough analysis. Let's think of a way to get out of here. What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected?#
KIRK: Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human?#
KIRK: Doc. How?#
KIRK: Doc!#
KIRK: Don't you know me?#
KIRK: Think, man. The Enterprise. The ship. Remember?#
KIRK: You do remember!#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: All right. Work on Bones. See if you can't#
KIRK: Joy to you, friend. Peace and contentment will fill you. You will know the peace of Landru. (Kirk leaves, and Spock is fastened to the wall for his treatment. The lights waver as the Lawgivers leave Marplon to his work.)#
KIRK: Peace and tranquillity to you.  Are you all right?#
KIRK: I understand. Landru.#
KIRK: And?#
KIRK: Joy be yours, and tranquillity, my friend.#
KIRK: The Body is one.#
KIRK: My friends.  What is your theory, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: And when something unexplained happens, their routine is disrupted.#
KIRK: Landru.#
KIRK: You're thinking the same thing I am. Mister Spock, the plug must be pulled.#
KIRK: Landru must die.#
KIRK: That refers to a living, growing culture. Do you think this one is?#
KIRK: What we need is more information about Landru. (Reger shakes his head) You said you wanted us to help you.#
KIRK: Never mind what the prophecy says. If you want to be liberated from Landru, we'll need your help.#
KIRK: Peace#
KIRK: to you, friend. Joy and tranquillity.#
KIRK: Doc, I don't want to hurt you.#
KIRK: Spock. (More lawgivers enter, and are overpowered. Spock uses a punch to knock his one out.) KIRK: Isn't that somewhat old-fashioned? Robes.#
KIRK: Where is Landru?#
KIRK: Where do we find him?#
KIRK: In this building?#
KIRK: You're going to take us there. (the two men are terrified at the prospect) Spock, call the Enterprise.#
KIRK: Snap out of it! Start acting like men.#
KIRK: Scotty, stand by. We're doing the best we can. How's Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Put a guard on him.#
KIRK: That's an order. Watch him. Captain out.#
KIRK: What happened to him?#
KIRK: You said you wanted freedom. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. Come on. We're going to find Landru.#
KIRK: It's too late for that.#
KIRK: All right, it's up to you. Take us to Landru.#
KIRK: Open it.#
KIRK: Open it. (Marplon makes a deep bow, and the door opens outwards. They enter the empty room.)#
KIRK: Landru! Landru. We are the Archons. We are the Archons. We've come to speak. We are the Archons. We want to talk to you.#
KIRK: We have no intention of causing harm.#
KIRK: We do not intend to die.#
KIRK: Listen to me.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. Let's have a look at the projector. (They both use their phasers to blast a hole in the wall. As expected, there are nice clean big computer boxes in a room beyond. Lights are flashing and blinking, blinking and flashing.) KIRK: Of course. It had to be. Landru.#
KIRK: But no soul.#
KIRK: Pull out its plug, Mister Spock. (Before they can press the buttons on their phasers, there is a high-pitched sound)#
KIRK: Landru died six thousand years ago.#
KIRK: But not his wisdom. He may have programmed you, but he could not have given you a soul. You are a machine.#
KIRK: Yes. What is the good?#
KIRK: Landru is dead. You are a machine. A question has been put to you. Answer it.#
KIRK: Then I put it to you that you have disobeyed the Prime Directive. You are harmful to the Body.#
KIRK: The body is dying. You are destroying it.#
KIRK: What have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual of the Body?#
KIRK: Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity. Without creativity, there is no life. The body dies. The fault is yours.#
KIRK: Landru, answer the question.#
KIRK: You must create the good. That is the will of Landru, nothing else.#
KIRK: Then the evil must be destroyed. That is the Prime Directive. And you are the evil.#
KIRK: You are the evil. The evil must be destroyed. Fulfill the Prime Directive.#
KIRK: You#
KIRK: are the evil. Fulfill the Prime Directive.#
KIRK: Well, Marplon, you're on your own now. I hope you're up to it. And you can get rid of those robes. If I were you, I'd start look for another job. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: What about the ship?#
KIRK: Excellent, Scotty. Stand by to beam up landing party. Let's go and see how the others are doing. Marplon can finish up here. Captain's log, stardate 3158.7 The Enterprise is preparing to leave Beta Three in Star system C One Eleven. Sociologist Lindstrom is remaining behind with a party of experts who will help restore the planet's culture to a human form.#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: But only a machine, Mister Spock. The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, his understanding, his soul, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: You'd make a splendid computer, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Yes, Lindstrom.#
KIRK: How's it going?#
KIRK: Sounds most promising. Good luck.#
KIRK: Yes. And we never got it. Just lucky, I guess.#
KIRK: Nothing yet, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Nothing yet, Ambassador. We're awaiting a reply. Today's the first time we've had any evidence they've picked up our signal.#
KIRK: Are you sure?#
KIRK: Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach that planet. No circumstances what so ever.#
KIRK: Mister Fox, it is their planet.#
KIRK: By disregarding code seven-ten, you might well involve us in an interplanetary war.#
KIRK: You are. I'm thinking about this ship, my crew.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. This is the Captain. Condition Yellow Alert. Phaser crews stand by. Deflector shields up. We're going in. Peacefully, I hope. But peacefully or not, we're going in. Captain's log, stardate 3192.5. Now in standard orbit around planet Eminiar Seven. My orders are clear. We must establish diplomatic relations at all cost. Preparing to beam down to planet surface.#
KIRK: Anything else?#
KIRK: Not alone. I'm taking some security people with me.#
KIRK: I can't risk beaming you down there until I know what kind of reception you're going to receive. Your safety is my responsibility. Those are my orders, sir. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: What co-ordinates?#
KIRK: Final sensor readings?#
KIRK: Ship's defences?#
KIRK: Good. Landing party will pick up phaser number one's from the arsenal. Keep them inconspicuous. Mister Scott.#
KIRK: The ship is yours. Take care of her until I come back.#
KIRK: We'll do our best. Let's go.#
KIRK: I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets.#
KIRK: Yes?#
KIRK: I had orders to come here. Why did your people tell us to stay away?#
KIRK: I see no danger here.#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Lieutenants Galloway, Osborne, Yeoman Tamula.#
KIRK: My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your people and mine.#
KIRK: Would you mind telling me why?#
KIRK: You're still at war?#
KIRK: You conceal it very well. Mister Spock?#
KIRK: To say the least.#
KIRK: Don't you take shelter?#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Mea, if this is an attack, may I ask what weapons the enemy is using?#
KIRK: Kirk to Bridge. Scotty?#
KIRK: Scanners operative on the planet's surface?#
KIRK: Anything unusual?#
KIRK: Thank you. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this entire planet under surveillance. All during this so-called attack of yours, we have been monitoring you. There's been no attack, no explosions, no radiations, no disturbances whatsoever. If this is some sort of game you're playing#
KIRK: Computer don't kill a half million people.#
KIRK: To report?#
KIRK: You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration machine when they're told to?#
KIRK: What has happened?#
KIRK: We require a great deal. I wish to speak to Anan Seven.#
KIRK: He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if he doesn't get in here and talk to me.#
KIRK: Your duty doesn't include stepping into a disintegrator and disappearing.#
KIRK: Is that all it means to you? To report and die?#
KIRK: Then how can you stand#
KIRK: No, I don't see that at all.#
KIRK: Yes. Anan Seven.#
KIRK: Good news, Mister Scott. The Eminians have agreed to the establishment of full normal diplomatic relations.#
KIRK: They've also extended an invitation to all personnel to come ashore, for shore leave. They've assured me that our people will have a wonderful time.#
KIRK: Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Do your best. (Spock goes to the door and begins to slowly work his way across it. Outside, the guard starts to blink and shake his head. Spock reaches the place directly behind the guard and looks as if he is doing a mind meld through the wall. Slowly, the guard opens the door and enters. He is swiftly disarmed and knocked out.) KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship. Mister Spock, we'll need more weapons.#
KIRK: We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill (As holder of the only gun, Kirk leads the way into the corridors of the city.)#
KIRK: A disintegration machine.#
KIRK: Mea. What do you think you're doing?#
KIRK: You're not going in there.#
KIRK: No you're not.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, that guard. I'll cover you. (Spock walks nonchalantly up to the guard in charge of disintegrating the waiting queue of people.)#
KIRK: All right, you people, clear out of the way.#
KIRK: Throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery.#
KIRK: I've done it.  Come on, let's get out of here.#
KIRK: The last place they'll look for us is the place we escaped from. Cover the door.#
KIRK: Are you that anxious to die?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, how did that little raid work out?#
KIRK: Will it reach the ship?#
KIRK: Work on it. We've got to contact the ship. Mea, I want you to give me a complete layout of this building complex. How do I get to the War Room?#
KIRK: Now listen to me. I'm trying to help you. To save your life and the lives of millions like you. If you help me, maybe I can do it. If you don't, you'll die, we'll die, and the killing will go on. Or are you that fond of the war?#
KIRK: We're going to try and stop the killing. We're trying to help. Believe me.#
KIRK: Tell me what I want to know. Please.#
KIRK: I didn't come to drink.#
KIRK: A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it.#
KIRK: I am?#
KIRK: We're less cold-blooded about it than you are.#
KIRK: I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators?#
KIRK: You take a lot of chances, Councilman.#
KIRK: If I were you, I'd think about saving my life.#
KIRK: I'm not interested in discussing our differences. You don't seem to realise the risk you're taking. We don't make war with computers and herd the casualties into suicide stations. We make the real thing, Councilman. I could destroy this planet.#
KIRK: I don't need the ship for that.#
KIRK: That's exactly what I mean.#
KIRK: You seem to think I'm joking. Where are the communicators?#
KIRK: Something like that.#
KIRK: My people are not responsible for your agreements.#
KIRK: That seems to frighten you.#
KIRK: Yes. You're quite right.#
KIRK: I'm a barbarian. You said it yourself.#
KIRK: Oh, no. You were quite accurate. I plan to prove it to you. ANAN: Open a channel to the Enterprise. You give me no choice, Captain. We are not bandits, but you force us to act as bandits.#
KIRK: Scotty, General Order Twenty Four. Two hours! In two hours!#
KIRK: All that it means is that I won't be around for the destruction. You heard me give General Order Twenty Four. That means in two hours the Enterprise will destroy Eminiar Seven.#
KIRK: I didn't start it, Councilman, but I'm liable to finish it. (Meanwhile Spock and his group are moving through the corridors. Fox's aide gets injured in one weapons exchange so they leave him behind.)#
KIRK: You're wrong. It hasn't begun.#
KIRK: You have less than two hours, Councilman.#
KIRK: Stop it? I'm counting on it.#
KIRK: Hold it! Over there. You, over there. Move, move, move. (Everyone goes over against a wall, while Kirk gets a second weapon and stands by the council table.) KIRK: Now we'll talk.#
KIRK: No. I need the help. In there, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in, Scotty.#
KIRK: Everything's secure here. Maintain position. If everything goes according to plan, you can beam us up in ten minutes. If you don't hear from us, carry out General Order Twenty Four on schedule.#
KIRK: Cross your fingers. Kirk out. Death, destruction, disease, horror. That's what war is all about, Anan. That's what makes it a thing to be avoided. You've made it neat and painless. So neat and painless, you've had no reason to stop it. And you've had it for five hundred years. Since it seems to be the only way I can save my crew and my ship, I'm going to end it for you, one way or another. Mister Ambassador.#
KIRK: Would you mind taking these people out into the corridor and holding them there.#
KIRK:  You. Come with me. Mister Osborne.#
KIRK: Our communicators, weapons.#
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock. SPOCK: These are the attack computers, Captain. That one's defence, that one computes the casualties. They're all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts. KIRK: Yes, go on.#
KIRK: Good. Get him out of here.#
KIRK: Let's go.#
KIRK: Against the wall!#
KIRK: Yes, I do. I've given you back the horrors of war. The Vendikans now assume that you've broken your agreement and that you're preparing to wage real war with real weapons. They'll want do the same. Only the next attack they launch will do a lot more than count up numbers in a computer. They'll destroy cities, devastate your planet. You of course will want to retaliate. If I were you, I'd start making bombs. Yes, Councilman, you have a real war on your hands. You can either wage it with real weapons, or you might consider an alternative. Put an end to it. Make peace.;#
KIRK: All right. It's instinctive. But the instinct can be fought. We're human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands, but we can stop it. We can admit that we're killers, but we're not going to kill today. That's all it takes. Knowing that we won't kill today. Contact Vendikar. I think you'll find that they're just as terrified, appalled, horrified as you are, that they'll do anything to avoid the alternative I've given you. Peace or utter destruction. It's up to you.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty?#
KIRK: Cancel implementation of General Order Twenty Four. Alert transporter room. We're ready to beam up.#
KIRK: Lay in a course for Argona Two, Navigator. Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: Did I, Mister Spock? They've been killing three million people a year. It had been going on for five hundred years. An actual attack wouldn't have killed any more people than one of their computer attacks, but it would have ended their ability to make war. The fighting would have been over permanently.#
KIRK: No. It was a calculated risk. Still, the Eminians keep a very orderly society, and actual war is a very messy business. A very, very messy business. I had a feeling that they would do anything to avoid it, even talk peace.#
KIRK: Sometimes a feeling, Mister Spock, is all we humans have to go on.#
KIRK: Why, Mister Spock, you almost make me believe in miracles.#
KIRK: Are you certain of your sensor readings?#
KIRK: Origin?#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: We're reading it, Lieutenant. I thought you said it couldn't possibly be an Earth vessel.#
KIRK: An emotional Earth weakness of mine. There it is.#
KIRK: An old Earth vessel, similar to the DY=500 class.#
KIRK: Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic.#
KIRK: Weapons status.#
KIRK: Bioscanners report.#
KIRK: All decks go to full alert. (Enterprise comes alongside the smaller ship, which is still as big as the engineering hull. Captain's log, stardate 3141.9. A full hour has elapsed since interception of the strange vessel. Our presence alongside is still being completely ignored. Although our sensors continue to show signs of equipment and life aboard, there has been no indication of danger to us.#
KIRK: Weapons department, maintain battle stations. All other decks standby alert.#
KIRK: Alien bodies, Bones?#
KIRK: Then you can check the registry.#
KIRK: All right, all right, gentlemen. As you were. Rig for tractor beam, Helm. Lock onto that vessel.#
KIRK: The Bridge is yours, Mister Spock. Care to join the landing party, Doctor?#
KIRK: I'm not. Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-Century Earth. Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change. What's her name? McIvers?#
KIRK: Very interesting. You ready, Bones?#
KIRK: You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy. Where's that historian? Come on, Lieutenant#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Suspended animation.#
KIRK: Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel?#
KIRK: Scotty?#
KIRK: Could he be the leader? The leader. Lieutenant?#
KIRK: The others?#
KIRK: Circuit shorting.#
KIRK: Can we?#
KIRK: What happens if we get him out of there?#
KIRK: How long have you been sleeping? Two centuries we estimate. Landing party to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: Lock in on McCoy's beam. He's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here.#
KIRK: Kirk to boarding party.#
KIRK: Scotty, any records, log books of any kind?#
KIRK: How many alive?#
KIRK: Kirk out. Seventy two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mister Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years.#
KIRK: Botany Bay. That was the name of a penal colony on shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel#
KIRK: Oh?#
KIRK: Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours.#
KIRK: And that irritates you, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Yeah.#
KIRK: My apologies, Mister Spock. You suspect some danger in them?#
KIRK: Well, we'd better get some facts. Rig for towing.#
KIRK: Make course for Starbase Twelve.#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: My compliments.#
KIRK: An improved breed of human. That's what the Eugenics War was all about.#
KIRK: I'd like to talk to you.#
KIRK: If I were to rate your performance as a member of the landing party today I#
KIRK: Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel might depend upon the performance of a single crewman, and the fact that you find a man strangely compelling to you personally#
KIRK: And men were more adventuresome then. Bolder, more colourful.#
KIRK: Good. If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes. That's all.#
KIRK: Fair? (In the ward, Khan wakes, gets out of bed and does some stretches. He hears McCoy's voice.)#
KIRK: James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise.#
KIRK: And your name?#
KIRK: Our heading is Starbase Twelve, a planet in the Gamma 400 star system. Our command base in this sector. Is that of any use to you?#
KIRK: Seventy two of your life-support canisters are still functioning.#
KIRK: As soon as we reach Starbase Twelve.#
KIRK: And now#
KIRK: Khan. Nothing else?#
KIRK: What was the exact date of your lift off? We know it was sometime in the early 1990s, but#
KIRK: The facts I need, Mister Khan, will take very little time. For example, the nature of your expedition.#
KIRK: Yes, I understand. You have two hundred years of catching up to do.#
KIRK: They're available to any patient on the viewing screen. Doctor McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes.#
KIRK: This Khan is not what I expected of a twentieth century man.#
KIRK: Common courtesy, Mister Spock. He'll spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding?#
KIRK: Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant. They began to battle among themselves.#
KIRK: Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons.#
KIRK: That fact isn't in the history texts.#
KIRK: Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century. Just how strongly is she attracted to him?#
KIRK: My curiosity's official, not personal, Bones.#
KIRK: Forgive my curiosity, Mister Khan, but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey.#
KIRK: You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mister Khan. This is a social occasion.#
KIRK: You fled. Why? Were you afraid?#
KIRK: But you left at the very time mankind needed courage.#
KIRK: We?#
KIRK: Name, Khan, as we know him today. Name, Khan Noonien Singh.#
KIRK: He was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous. They were supermen, in a sense. Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more daring.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us. Appalling, but there, nevertheless.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you misunderstand us. We can be against him and admire him all at the same time.#
KIRK: Totally. This is the Captain. Put a twenty four hour security on Mister Khan's quarters, effective immediately.#
KIRK: Unusual treatment for Khan Noonien Singh.#
KIRK: I'd like those answers now. First, the purpose of your star flight.#
KIRK: Why? Because I'm not a product of controlled genetics?#
KIRK: Thank you. They've all been answered. (He leaves, and the guard resumes his post. Khan summons his strength, wrenches the locked door open and knocks out his guard with a single blow.)#
KIRK: Maintain.  Bridge.#
KIRK: Sound security alert.#
KIRK: Atmospheric controls cut off.#
KIRK: Engineering. Scotty. This is the Bridge.#
KIRK: What's going on down there?#
KIRK: Flood all decks with neural gas.#
KIRK: Contact Starbase Twelve.#
KIRK: Negative.#
KIRK: I'm a little pleased myself. Situation?#
KIRK: Our only chance is the intruder control circuit. Although he's cut it off at the Bridge.#
KIRK: Gas all decks but this one.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: This hearing is now in session. Under the authority vested in me by Starfleet Command, I declare all charges and specifications in this matter have been dropped.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, our heading takes us near the Ceti Alpha star system.#
KIRK: But no more than Australia's Botany Bay colony was at the beginning. Those men went on to tame a continent, Mister Khan. Can you tame a world?#
KIRK: Yes. I understand. Lieutenant Marla McGivers. Given a choice of court martial or accompanying them there.#
KIRK: This hearing is closed.#
KIRK: The statement Lucifer made when he fell into the pit. 'It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.'#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, it would indeed.#
KIRK: Standard orbit, Mister Painter.#
KIRK: Yes, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, there were one hundred and fifty men, women, and children in that colony. What are the chances of survivors?#
KIRK: Are you saying that those people built a future in a place knowing they might not survive?#
KIRK: And what about us? Can we afford to send people to the planet's surface?#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Painter. Mister Spock, equip a landing party of five to accompany me to the planet's surface. Include Doctor McCoy and a biologist. I'll want them in ten minutes.#
KIRK: Another dream that failed. There's nothing sadder. It took these people a year to make the trip from Earth. They came all that way and died.#
KIRK: Actually, Mister Sandoval, we didn't come here because of your silent radio.#
KIRK: But these people shouldn't be alive.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, we're debating in a vacuum. Let's go get some answers.#
KIRK: What was the reason for the dispersal?#
KIRK: Mister Sandoval, we do have a mission here. Examinations, tests.#
KIRK: We'll try not to interfere with your work.#
KIRK: Anything?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Very well. Continue investigations. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Yes, especially in view of the fact that the records for this expedition indicate that they did have some for breeding and food purposes. Apparently, none of them survived.#
KIRK: Yes, I thought you might.#
KIRK: He promised to throw away his shingle.#
KIRK: Go ahead, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Make your point.#
KIRK: It's like a jigsaw puzzle all one colour. No key to where the pieces fit in. Why?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Trouble?#
KIRK: On my way.#
KIRK: What's so strange about that?#
KIRK: Instrument malfunction?#
KIRK: Mister Sandoval, within the hour I've received orders from Starfleet Command to evacuate all personnel from this colony. Naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations. We will have accommodations for you aboard the Enterprise.#
KIRK: It's not an arbitrary decision on my part. I have my orders.#
KIRK: What about your animals?#
KIRK: That doesn't answer my question, sir. Why did all your animals die?#
KIRK: Sandoval.#
KIRK: You're being unreasonable.#
KIRK: Excuse me. My orders are to remove all the colonists. That's exactly what I intend to do, with or without your help. ELIAS; Without, I should think.#
KIRK: No, I think we'll use a#
KIRK: We have orders to evacuate all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven. I want landing parties to co-ordinate the colonists and prepare them for transport up to the ship. We'll need extra accommodations aboard. Where's Mister Spock and Mister DeSalle?#
KIRK: No, he didn't.  Spock? See to the landing parties, would you, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Spock, is that you?#
KIRK: Spock, I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is an order. Report back to me at the settlement in ten minutes. We're evacuating all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven.#
KIRK: You don't think so, what?#
KIRK: Spock, report to me immediately.#
KIRK: Spock. The frequency is open, but he doesn't answer.#
KIRK: No. I thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a little.#
KIRK: You said that.#
KIRK: Yes, take over the landing party detail and start getting those colonists aboard.#
KIRK: The frequency is open. It'll act as a homing device. Contact DeSalle. Have him meet you here. Make sure the landing party work in teams of two. I don't want anybody left alone down here.#
KIRK: Spock.  Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Are you out of your mind? You were told to report to me at once.#
KIRK: You? Yes, I can see that. Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, Mister Spock is under arrest, and he's in your custody until we get back to the Enterprise.#
KIRK: What's?#
KIRK: I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship.#
KIRK: How many of those did you beam up?#
KIRK: This is the Captain. Beam me up.#
KIRK: I most certainly do. Energise.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, put me through to Admiral Komack at Starfleet.#
KIRK: What do you mean, you can't do that. Follow standard procedure. That's an order.#
KIRK: Out?#
KIRK: Get back to your stations. Get back to your stations.#
KIRK: I said get back to your station.#
KIRK: This is mutiny, mister.#
KIRK: I've heard that word a lot lately. Perfect. Everything's perfect.#
KIRK: I'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back.#
KIRK: Look, Bones, I need your help. Can you run tests, blood samples, anything at all to give us a lead on what these things are, how to counteract them?#
KIRK: Bones. Bones.#
KIRK: Where's McCoy?#
KIRK: In your own private paradise.#
KIRK: Where did they originate?#
KIRK: That's paradise?#
KIRK: No wants. No needs. We weren't meant for that. None of us. Man stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than he is.#
KIRK: Except a challenge.#
KIRK: I'm going back to the ship.#
KIRK: Engineering? Scotty? Biochemistry lab? Security? Is there anyone on board? This is the Captain.#
KIRK: Captain's log, stardate 3417.7. Except for myself, all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet. Mutinied. Lieutenant Uhura has effectively sabotaged the communications station. I can only contact the surface of the planet. The ship can be maintained in orbit for several months, but even with automatic controls, I cannot pilot her alone. In effect, I am marooned here. I'm beginning to realise just how big this ship really is, how quiet. I don't know how to get my crew back, how to counteract the effect of the spores. I don't know what I can offer against paradise.#
KIRK: Enterprise to Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I've joined you. I understand now.#
KIRK: There are some things in my quarters I want to pack.#
KIRK: No. No! I can't leave!  Emotions. Violent emotions. Needs. Anger. Captain's log, supplemental. I think I've discovered the answer, but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk. Mister Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being. Aroused, his great physical strength could kill. But it's a risk I'll have to take.#
KIRK: I've been packing some things, and I realise there's some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement.#
KIRK: No, I think you and I can handle it. Why don't you beam up now?#
KIRK: All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship.#
KIRK: What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid.#
KIRK: Of course you don't understand. You don't have the brains to understand. All you have is printed circuits.#
KIRK: What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia?#
KIRK: Your father was a computer, like his son. An ambassador from a planet of traitors. A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity.#
KIRK: You're a traitor from a race of traitors. Disloyal to the core, rotten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to make love to that girl.#
KIRK: Does she know what she's getting, Spock? A carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in a mushroom, instead of passing himself off as a man? You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship. Right next to the dog-faced boy. (Spock bends the metal bar with one blow, and throws Kirk around the transporter room with ease. Fortunately, Kirk is able to dodge the blows that damage the walls and equipment until finally...) KIRK: Had enough? I didn't realise what it took to get under that thick hide of yours. Anyhow, I don't know what you're so mad about. It isn't every first officer who gets to belt his Captain several times.#
KIRK: Believe me, Mister Spock, it was painful in more ways than one.#
KIRK: You said they were benevolent and peaceful. Violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them. I had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence. That's the answer, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I had something else in mind. Can you put together a subsonic transmitter. Something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator?#
KIRK: Good. Let's get to work.#
KIRK: Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spores?#
KIRK: The Captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence.#
KIRK: As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin.#
KIRK: Put him on the speaker. Kirk here.#
KIRK: Start making preparations, Mister Sandoval. We'll begin transporting your people aboard as soon as more of our crew checks in.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: No, no, Bones. This time we walked out on our own. Maybe we weren't meant for paradise. Maybe we were meant to fight our way through. Struggle, claw our way up, scratch for every inch of the way. Maybe we can't stroll to the music of the lute. We must march to the#
KIRK: We haven't heard much from you about Omicron Ceti Three, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: All right, let's assume there is a monster. What has it done? When did it start?#
KIRK: Yes, we're aware of that. If mining conditions weren't so difficult, Janus Six could supply the mineral needs of a thousand planets. But what happened?#
KIRK: Volcanic activity?#
KIRK: Same way? Burned?#
KIRK: Do you post sentries? Guards?#
KIRK: Who else has seen this?#
KIRK: Describe it.#
KIRK: That's why we're here, Mister Vanderberg.#
KIRK: I don't think we'll need to, Mister Appel. Mister Vanderberg, we'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries and tunnels. Mister Vanderberg, I'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries, tunnels.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Vanderberg. We'll need your complete co-operation.#
KIRK: The vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier. Doc?#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: Strong enough to eat machinery?#
KIRK: Mister Spock.;#
KIRK: Mister Vanderberg, how recent are these charts?#
KIRK: Before the appearance of whatever it is?#
KIRK: I see. Mister Spock give us a report on life beneath the surface. Within range of our sensors, there is no life, other than the accountable human residents of this colony beneath the surface. At least, no life as we know it. KIRK: We can't cover tunnel by tunnel on foot. We must get production going again. We must have that pergium.#
KIRK: Too many tunnels. We couldn't possibly. Mister Spock, our sensors can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance, but what about abnormal life functions?#
KIRK: Is there a replacement for that?#
KIRK: Spock, on board?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, we seem to have been given a choice. Death by asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning.#
KIRK: Can you rig one up? It's vital.#
KIRK: How long?#
KIRK: Forty eight hours is better than nothing. Gather what you need and beam down here with it. {Bridge]#
KIRK: Hopefully we'll have found the missing part by then.#
KIRK: We'll have to, Chief. The alternative is to evacuate all you people up to the Enterprise. A dozen planets depend on you for pergium for their reactor. They're already screaming. Reactors closing down, life support systems#
KIRK: Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet?#
KIRK: But why now, Mister Spock? These production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years.#
KIRK: What's that?#
KIRK: Not necessarily, Bones. I've heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon. A silicon-based life would be of an entirely different order. It's possible that our phasers might not affect it.#
KIRK: All right, how about this? A creature that lives deep in the planet below us, at home in solid rock. It seems to me that in order to survive, it would have to have some form of natural armour plating.#
KIRK: But our people have phaser number two.#
KIRK: You may be right, Doctor, but at least it's something to go on. Mister Spock, have Lieutenant Commander Giotto assemble the security troops and arm them with phaser number two. You make the proper adjustments. You seem fascinated by this rock.#
KIRK: Do they tie in?#
KIRK: Speculate.#
KIRK: A short time, Mister Spock. We have very little.#
KIRK: How's it going, Scotty?#
KIRK: It has to hold longer than a bit.#
KIRK:  Kirk here.#
KIRK: I'll be right there. Kirk out. Scotty, ride herd on it. Kind words. Tender, loving care. Kiss it. Baby it. Flatter it if you have to, but keep it going.#
KIRK: You will proceed from level to level, checking out every foot, every opening. You are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire. Phasers will be set on maximum, and remember this. Fifty people have died. I want no more deaths.#
KIRK: The creature may or may not attack on sight. However, you must. It is vitally important we get this installation back into production.#
KIRK: It's one of the possibilities we've discussed.  I want your people to stay on the top level, together at a safe place.#
KIRK: Well, gentlemen, you have your instructions. Let's get at it.#
KIRK: Mister Spock? Find something?#
KIRK: Traces?#
KIRK: One of our people?#
KIRK: Come on. (The security team have gradually split up to cover all the different tunnels. A young blond lad manages a scream before meeting his fate.)#
KIRK: It's only been seconds since we heard him scream. The creature must still be around.#
KIRK: Are you certain?#
KIRK: This tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see. Our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this, not even with phasers.#
KIRK: Gone.#
KIRK: These walls are hot.#
KIRK: Yes, perfectly.#
KIRK: Yes, we saw it. Where does the tunnel go?#
KIRK: Yes. We took a bite out of it.#
KIRK: It's not animal tissue. What is it?#
KIRK: Then your guess was right.#
KIRK: Summation.#
KIRK: That would account for the tunnels.#
KIRK: Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber.#
KIRK: It's definitely phaser resistant. We had our weapons set for silicon and on full power, yet we only damaged it. It still lives. GIOTTO You mean it's impossible to kill? KIRK: No. No, it might require amassed phasers.#
KIRK: Commander, pass this on to your men We knew it was a killer. Now it's wounded, probably in pain somewhere back there. There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal. Commander Giotto, instruct your men to concentrate the search in this sector. Remind them the creature is wounded.#
KIRK: What is it, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: One creature in a hundred miles?#
KIRK: Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life span.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again. This is not a zoological expedition. Maintain a constant reading on the creature. If we have to, we'll use phasers to cut our own tunnels. We'll try to surround it. I'm sorry, Mister Spock, but I'm afraid the creature must die.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: So it is wounded, and therefore twice as dangerous. Stay in pairs. If you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head. Concentrate it. Maintain it. It is definitely resistant, but it can be hurt. And if it can be hurt, it can be killed. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Your orders are shoot to kill. Protect yourself at all times. Commander Giotto, disperse your search parties.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Capture it? I don't recall giving any such order.#
KIRK: I will lose no more men. The creature will be killed on sight and that's the end of it.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that makeshift circulating pump.#
KIRK: You heard me. It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation. Your scientific knowledge#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you are second in command. This will be a dangerous hunt. Either one of us by himself is expendable. Both of us are not.#
KIRK: 2,228.7 to 1? Those are pretty good odds, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Of course. Well, I hate to use the word, but logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay. But please stay out of trouble, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Can you fix it again?#
KIRK: Start immediate evacuation of all colonists to the Enterprise.#
KIRK: We haven't enough phasers for you.#
KIRK: Good. Get everybody else aboard the Enterprise. The fewer people we have breathing the air down here, the longer the rest of us will be able to hold out. How much longer, Scotty?#
KIRK: We'll do our best. Start feeding us constant status reports, Scotty. Vanderberg, you and your crew assemble at level twenty three, checkpoint Tiger. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Team up with the Enterprise security personnel. They're better armed than you. Keep someone in sight at all times. Vanderberg, take two men. Go through that tunnel there. Rendezvous with Commander Giotto. Appel and the rest of the men, go through there and tie up with Lieutenant Osborne's detail. Mister Spock and I will control the operation from a central point. That's all.#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Are you sure? Intuition?#
KIRK: The chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further. You take the left. I'll take the right.#
KIRK: Two tunnels, two of us. We separate. (Kirk walks off down a real tunnel, while Spock has to hunch down to move through one of the new circular tunnels. Further on, Kirk's tunnel becomes circular too, then it opens into an area with flat floor, equipment and silicon nodules.)#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I've found a whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours, hundreds of them.#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, I'm all right. We seem to have had a cave-in.#
KIRK: Besides, it isn't necessary. The chart said the tunnels meet further on.#
KIRK: Very well, Mister Spock. I'll meet you at the other end. (Just then a part of the wall vanishes, and their strange adversary emerges. The pair have a stand off, with the creature approaching when Kirk lowers his phaser, and backing off when he raises it. The communicator beeps.) KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: It's not necessary, Mister Spock. I know exactly where the creature is.#
KIRK: Ten feet away from me.#
KIRK: It's not making any threatening moves, Spock.#
KIRK: I thought you were the one who wanted it kept alive, captured if possible.#
KIRK: It seems to be waiting.#
KIRK:  Well, what do we do, just talk it over?#
KIRK: Well, you can be hurt, can't you? We just sit here? It's your move.#
KIRK: No, no! Don't shoot. Come on over, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: No. It seems to be waiting. I tried talking to it, but it didn't do any good.#
KIRK: Yes, they're all through here, all over the place. Thousands of them.#
KIRK: Does it means something to you?#
KIRK: You think you can get through to that thing?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, I know it's a terrible personal lowering of mental barriers but if there's a chance#
KIRK: No kill I. What is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a promise that it won't kill us?#
KIRK: A Horta. A Horta! Mister Spock, we need that retardation mechanism. You must re-establish communications with it.#
KIRK: Yes, I'm aware of that. If we could only win its confidence. Doctor McCoy, this is Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: Grab your medical kit and come down here on the double. I've got a patient for you.#
KIRK: Never mind. Just come down to the twenty third level. You'll be led to us by tricorder readings. Kirk out.#
KIRK: He's a healer, let him heal. Mister Spock, you must re-establish communications. I want to know why it suddenly took to murder.#
KIRK: We've seen how the creature destroys. (Kirk stands ready with his phaser as Spock carefully places his hands on the quivering Horta.) KIRK: Lieutenant Commander Giotto.#
KIRK: Perfectly all right. Where are you?#
KIRK: Under no circumstances allow them in here yet. The minute Doc McCoy gets there, send him through.#
KIRK: It's wounded. Badly. You've got to help it.#
KIRK: Go take a look.#
KIRK: Help it. Treat it.#
KIRK: You're a healer. There's a patient. That's an order. Mister Spock. Tell it we're trying to help. The mechanism.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Mister Spock. Spock. Spock! Come out of it. I found the unit in there. It's in pretty good shape. I also found about a million of these silicon nodules. They're eggs, aren't they?#
KIRK: How are you doing, Doc?#
KIRK: Don't fire. First man that fires is dead.#
KIRK: You've killed thousands of her children.#
KIRK: Those round silicon nodules that you've been collecting and destroying? They're her eggs. Tell them, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: The Horta is intelligent, peaceful, mild. She had no objection to sharing this planet with you, till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs. Then she fought back in the only way she knew how, as any mother would fight when her children are in danger.#
KIRK: This is where they live. They digest rock, they tunnel for nourishment.#
KIRK: Yes, I know. Here's your circulating pump. You've complained this planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it. Gentlemen, the Horta moves through rock the way we move through air, and it leaves tunnels. The greatest natural miners in the universe. It seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a modus vivendi. They tunnel. You collect and process, and your process operation would be a thousand times more profitable.#
KIRK: Can you help it?#
KIRK: How?#
KIRK: Well, Spock, I'm going to have to ask you to get in touch with the Horta again. Tell her our proposition. She and her children can do all the tunnelling they want. Our people will remove the minerals, and each side will leave the other alone. Think she'll go for it?#
KIRK: Very good, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Fine. Yes, Chief. Kirk here.#
KIRK: I'm delighted to hear that, Chief. Once Mother Horta tells her kids what to look for, you people are going to be embarrassingly rich.#
KIRK: Our pleasure, Chief. Kirk out.#
KIRK: She really liked those ears?#
KIRK: Because she approved of you?#
KIRK: Does not bear close examination, Mister Spock. I suspect you're becoming more and more human all the time.#
KIRK: Ahead, warp factor two.#
KIRK: Good.  We both guessed right. Negotiations with the Klingon Empire are on the verge of breaking down. Starfleet Command anticipates a surprise attack. We are to proceed to Organia and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the Klingons from using it as a base.#
KIRK: Organia's description, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Another Armenia, Belgium.#
KIRK: The weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural invasion routes.#
KIRK: Configuration, Mister Sulu. (Everyone is thrown about as the Enterprise is hit by multiple weapons fire.) KIRK: Phaser banks, lock on. Return fire. Maintain firing rate. One hundred percent dispersal pattern.#
KIRK: Damage control, report to the first officer.#
KIRK: All hands, maintain general alert. Hold battle stations. Damage report, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Maintain surveillance, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just experienced very nearly qualifies.#
KIRK: Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it.#
KIRK: War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the Klingons.#
KIRK: Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: We won't get it by talking about it. The trigger's been pulled. We have to get there before the hammer falls. Ahead warp factor seven. Captain's log, stardate 3198.4. We have reached Organia and established standard orbit. No signs of hostile activities in this area.#
KIRK: What bearing?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, have the phaser crews stand by their positions. Full power deflector screens.#
KIRK: Mister Spock and I are going to the planet's surface. You will be in command. Your responsibility is to the Enterprise, not to us. Is that clear?#
KIRK: The Klingon fleet is in this quadrant. We know that Organia will be a target. If they should emerge#
KIRK: You will evaluate the situation. If there is a fleet of them, you'll get out of here, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: No buts. You'll get to safety and alert the fleet. You will not attack alone. Mister Spock and I will be all right. Mister Spock, let's you and I pay the Organians a visit.#
KIRK: You'd think they had people beaming down every day.#
KIRK: Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle.#
KIRK: Reception committee?#
KIRK: I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. This is my first officer Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I would like to speak to someone in authority.#
KIRK: You people are in great danger. Is there someplace we can go and talk?#
KIRK: Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the Federation. My mission, frankly, is to keep them from doing it.#
KIRK: No, sir. With the Federation, you have a choice. You have none with the Klingons. The Klingons are a military dictatorship. War is their way of life. Life under the Klingon rule would be very unpleasant. We offer you protection.#
KIRK: You have this planet and its strategic location. I assure you that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises. We will help you build defences, build facilities.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like yours. They are organised into vast slave labour camps. No freedoms whatsoever. Your goods will be confiscated. Hostages taken and killed, your leaders confined. You'd be far better off on a penal planet. Infinitely better off.#
KIRK: You keep insisting there's no danger. I keep assuring you there is. Would you mind telling me#
KIRK: That's the first thing that would be lost! Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm a soldier, not a diplomat. I can only tell you the truth.#
KIRK: Certainly. (The doors open on their own and Spock enters. He and Kirk whisper in a corner.)#
KIRK: That doesn't seem likely.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. That might be useful.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider. We can be of immense help to you. In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists, technicians. We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before. We can help you build schools, educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills. Your public facilities are almost non-existent. We can help you remake your world, end disease, hunger, hardship. All we ask in return is that you let us help you. Now.#
KIRK:  Excuse me, sir. Kirk here.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, follow your orders. Get out of here. Contact the fleet. Return if the odds are more equal. Kirk out. Gentlemen, you kept insisting that there was no danger#
KIRK: Can you verify that?#
KIRK: If you had listened to me#
KIRK: How does he know that?#
KIRK: So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation army.#
KIRK: You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very pleasant prospect at all. Captain's Log. stardate 3201.7. Mister Spock and I are trapped on the planet Organia, which is in the process of being occupied by the forces of the Klingon Empire. The Organians have provided us with native clothing in the hopes we may be taken for Organians.#
KIRK: Did you take them?#
KIRK: I must ask you to return them.#
KIRK: They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation.#
KIRK: What about the rest of you?#
KIRK: You have a lot to learn, sir. And if I know the Klingons, you'll be learning it the hard way. (The doors open on their own, and two Klingons march in, followed by their leader.);#
KIRK: I have a tongue.#
KIRK: My what?#
KIRK: He's no spy.#
KIRK: He's done nothing. Nothing at all.#
KIRK: You're here. There's nothing I can do about it.#
KIRK: You need my approval?#
KIRK: You seem to be in command.#
KIRK: Me? I don't want the job.#
KIRK: And Mister Spock?#
KIRK: He is my friend.#
KIRK: I don't understand.#
KIRK: And you're proud of it.#
KIRK: Are you sure you're all right?#
KIRK: Or I will be killed.#
KIRK: That mindsifter can't be all the terror they think it is.#
KIRK: I'll try and avoid it.#
KIRK: You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?#
KIRK: You're right. But as you say, we still have a job to do.#
KIRK: Maybe, but sooner or later they'll start resenting how the Klingons run things. If we could prove to them they could do something to strike back, to keep the Klingons off balance.#
KIRK: That's exactly what I had in mind. Mister Spock Did I or did I not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's headquarters?#
KIRK: I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating. Tonight.#
KIRK: We're short of tools.#
KIRK: Okay so far. Sonic grenade?#
KIRK: You were right, Mister Spock. A most satisfactory display.#
KIRK: Of course we blew it up. Deliberately.#
KIRK: We did it to show you that you can fight back. You don't have to be sheep, you can be wolves.#
KIRK: History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship. We may not be able to destroy the Klingons, but we can tie them up. Blow up their installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to them.#
KIRK: Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom mean so little to you?#
KIRK: All I understand is that you apparently don't have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones.#
KIRK: Ayelborne!#
KIRK: I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for the likes of you.#
KIRK: No, thank you.#
KIRK: What do you want from me?#
KIRK: You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy?#
KIRK: Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope.#
KIRK: We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body.#
KIRK: It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't like the Klingons.#
KIRK: Go climb a tree.#
KIRK: It will take a lot longer than that, Commander.#
KIRK: How much of the twelve hours do we have left?#
KIRK: I think we can count on them being punctual. Blowing that munitions dump wasn't enough. If we get out of here, we've got to carry the attack directly to Kor. These Organians#
KIRK: Nevertheless, our orders still stand. We've got to make some attempt to neutralise the Klingon occupation.#
KIRK: And there are guards every few feet down the hall. (There are sounds outside, then the door swings silently open on it's own. Spock and Kirk are ready to pounce on whoever enters.)#
KIRK: Go?#
KIRK: You turned us over to them. You expect us to trust you now?#
KIRK: We can't stay here. This is the first place they'll look.#
KIRK: First you turn us in, then get us out. What are you doing now, waiting for the Klingons to post a reward so you can turn us in again and collect it?#
KIRK: What happened to them?#
KIRK: Is that's all you can do, smile?#
KIRK: I want to know how I'm free, and why.#
KIRK: This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves#
KIRK: Those are Klingon phasers. Take the door. Get down, gentlemen.#
KIRK: Did you hear them?#
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock. It seems it's up to you and me.#
KIRK: The Federation has invested a great deal of money in our training. They're about due for a small return. We have two hours with which to do it in.#
KIRK: No. No more will die on account of us, Mister Spock. Where are those phasers?#
KIRK: You've told us a great deal about how you hate violence. Unless you tell me where those phasers are, you're going to have more violence than you know what to do with.#
KIRK: It's entirely up to you.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your culture. Despite that, Mister Spock and I are going to go out there and quite probably die, in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for.#
KIRK: Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here. (The doors open politely to let them leave, then close again behind them.)#
KIRK: Mister Spock, can we get those two guards? What would you say the odds on our getting out of here?#
KIRK: Difficult to be precise? 7,824 to 1?;#
KIRK: That's a pretty close approximation.#
KIRK: You do quite well. Set your phaser on stun. We're after the top dog, not the members of the pack.#
KIRK: But if the situation calls for it, we kill, is that clear?#
KIRK: I'll take the one on the left. Fire.#
KIRK: If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and now. Is that clear?#
KIRK: Is Kor's office down there?#
KIRK: What about the hostages? Talk. Talk.#
KIRK: To be killed?#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Well, what are the odds now?#
KIRK: Less than seven thousand to one. Well, getting better. Getting better.#
KIRK: Just stay where you are, Commander.#
KIRK: Checkmate, Commander.#
KIRK: I don't intend to kill you unless I have to.#
KIRK: Cover, Spock! Back! (The Klingons burst it, then suddenly everyone drops their weapons. Everyone.)#
KIRK: What is it, Spock?#
KIRK: You are stopping this? You?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: Stand by, Sulu.#
KIRK: What have you done?#
KIRK: You're talking nonsense.#
KIRK: You can't just stop the fleet. What gives you the right?#
KIRK: We have legitimate grievances against the Klingons. They've invaded our territory, killed our citizens. They're openly aggressive. They've boasted that they'll take over half the galaxy.#
KIRK: You're the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas!#
KIRK: You should be the first to be on our side. Two hundred hostages killed.#
KIRK: Even if you have some power that we don't understand, you have no right to dictate to our Federation#
KIRK: How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right#
KIRK: Well, no one wants war. But there are proper channels. People have a right to handle their own affairs. Eventually, we would have;#
KIRK: What do you mean, beings like yourselves?#
KIRK: But what about this planet? The fields, the buildings, this citadel?#
KIRK: Well, Commander, I guess that takes care of the war. Obviously, the Organians aren't going to let us fight.#
KIRK: I'm embarrassed. I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want. We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe. It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong.#
KIRK: Oh, no, no, no, Mister Spock, We didn't beat the odds. We didn't have a chance. The Organians raided the game.#
KIRK: Stay on top of it, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Understood, Engineer. Mister Spock? We can't avoid these areas of turbulence.#
KIRK: Sickbay. To the Bridge.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Maintain orbit. Open the channel to Starfleet Command. Precautionary measure, Lieutenant. Broadcast to Starfleet Command my past week's log entries, starting with the unusual readings we had on the instruments and how they led us here. Inform Starfleet Command that apparently something or someone down on this planet#
KIRK:  Bones. Can effect changes in time, causing turbulent waves of space displacement.#
KIRK: Tricky stuff. Are you sure you want to risk#
KIRK: Who, me, Doctor?#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Bones! Get back to your positions.#
KIRK: It was set for cordrazine.#
KIRK: Communications, emergency medical team.#
KIRK: Security alert. Captain's log, supplemental entry. Two drops of cordrazine can save a man's life. A hundred times that amount has just accidentally been pumped into Doctor McCoy's body. In a strange, wild frenzy, he has fled the ship's Bridge. All connecting decks have been placed on alert. We have no way of knowing if the madness is permanent or temporary, or in what direction it will drive McCoy.#
KIRK: Continue alert, decks four through eleven. The medical department knows as little as we do. In dosages approaching this, there's some record of wild paranoia.#
KIRK: Bridge here. Go ahead.#
KIRK: So whatever's down there, McCoy is in the heart of it. Set up a landing party. Let's go get him. Kirk out.#
KIRK: These ruins extend to the horizon. Begin recording.#
KIRK: Detail, fan out. What is this thing, Mister Spock? It seems to be pulsating with power of some kind. Analysis, please.#
KIRK: That's funny.#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: Then what is it?#
KIRK: What are you?#
KIRK: Are you machine or being?#
KIRK: Annoyed, Spock?#
KIRK: Spock! If that is a doorway back through time, could we somehow take Bones back a day in time, then#
KIRK: Guardian. Can you change the speed at which yesterday passes?#
KIRK: Strangely compelling, isn't it? To step through there and lose oneself in another world.#
KIRK: Bones, no!#
KIRK: Where is he?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty.#
KIRK: McCoy has somehow changed history.#
KIRK: Earth's not there. At least, not the Earth we know. We're totally alone. Captain's log, no stardate. For us, time does not exist. McCoy, back somewhere in the past, has effected a change in the course of time. All Earth history has been changed. There is no starship Enterprise. We have only one chance. We have asked the Guardian to show us Earth's history again. Spock and I will go back into time ourselves and attempt to set right what ever it was that McCoy changed.#
KIRK: Make sure we arrive before McCoy got there. It's vital we stop him before he does whatever it was that changed all history. Guardian, if we are successful#
KIRK: Scotty, when you think you've waited long enough. Each of you will have to try it. Even if you fail, at least you'll be alive in some past world somewhere.#
KIRK: I've seen old photographs of this period. An economic upheaval had occurred.#
KIRK: We seem to be costumed a little out of step with the time.#
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock, if we can't disguise you, we'll find some way of explaining you.#
KIRK: Let's get out of here.#
KIRK: Well, we'll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later. I think I'm going to like this century. Simple, easier to manage. We're not going to have any difficulty explaining#
KIRK: You're a police officer. I recognise the traditional accoutrements.#
KIRK: My friend is obviously Chinese. I see you've noticed the ears. They're actually easy to explain.#
KIRK: The unfortunate accident he had as a child. He caught his head in a mechanical rice picker. But fortunately, there was an American missionary living close by who was actually a skilled plastic surgeon in civilian life.#
KIRK: Oh, how careless of your wife to let you go out that way.#
KIRK: You were actually enjoying my predicament back there. At times, you seem quite human.#
KIRK: Sorry.#
KIRK: Time we faced the unpleasant facts.#
KIRK: Arrives where? Honolulu, Boise, San Diego? Why not Outer Mongolia, for that matter?#
KIRK: And the same currents that swept McCoy to a certain time and place might sweep us there, too.#
KIRK: Couldn't you build some form of computer aid here?#
KIRK: Yes, well, it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic, Mister Spock. Excuse me. I sometimes expect too much of you.#
KIRK: Excuse us, miss. We didn't mean to trespass. It's cold outside.#
KIRK: No. We were being chased by a policeman.#
KIRK: These clothes. We stole them. We didn't have any money.#
KIRK: Mine is Jim Kirk. His is Spock.#
KIRK: Excuse me, Miss. Where are we?#
KIRK: Do you run this place?#
KIRK: Radio tubes and so on. I approve of hobbies, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: Shut up. Shut up. I want to hear what she has to say.#
KIRK: Development of atomic power is years away, and space flight years after that.#
KIRK: I find her most uncommon, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Then we can report back for other work?#
KIRK: A what?#
KIRK: Oh.#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: We have a flop.#
KIRK: A place to sleep.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, I've brought you some assorted vegetables, baloney in a hard rolls for myself, and I've spent the other nine tenths of our combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for you. Mister Spock, this bag doesn't contain platinum, silver or gold, nor is it likely to in the near future.#
KIRK: McCoy will be along in a few days, perhaps sooner. There's no guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together. This has to work.#
KIRK: Your hat.#
KIRK: If Mister Spock says that he needs the tools and that they'll be returned tomorrow morning, you can bet your reputation on that, Miss Keeler.#
KIRK: We served together.#
KIRK: Let me help. A hundred years or so from now, I believe, a famous novelist will write a classic using that theme. He'll recommend those three words even over I love you.#
KIRK: Silly question. Want to hear a silly answer?#
KIRK: A planet circling that far left star in Orion's belt. See? (Not that you can actually see any stars in the night sky above the Brooklyn Bridge.)#
KIRK: How are the stone knives and bearskins?#
KIRK: You may also find you have a connection burning someplace.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: Let's see what you have.#
KIRK: February 23rd, 1936. Six years from now. (reading below the headline FDR confers with slum area 'angel') The President and Edith Keeler conferred for some time today#
KIRK: How bad?#
KIRK: The President and Edith Keeler.#
KIRK: We know her future. Within six years from now, she'll become very important. Nationally famous.#
KIRK: You must be mistaken. They both can't be true.#
KIRK: She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she lives or dies, all of history will be changed. And McCoy#
KIRK: In his condition, what does he do? Does he kill her?#
KIRK: Get this thing fixed. We must find out before McCoy arrives.#
KIRK: How do you know?#
KIRK: And make them spend it on life?#
KIRK: The very same.#
KIRK: How long before we get a full answer?#
KIRK: McCoy could have been in the city a week now for all we know, and whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen tonight or tomorrow morning.#
KIRK: I must know whether she lives or dies, Spock. I must know what to do.#
KIRK: Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They won the Second World War.#
KIRK: But she was right. Peace was the way.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: How did she die? What day?#
KIRK: Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler.#
KIRK: Edith.#
KIRK: With ulterior motives. Does that please you?#
KIRK: No, of course you didn't.#
KIRK: It's not yet time. McCoy isn't here.#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: McCoy! Leonard McCoy?#
KIRK: Stay right here. Spock! Stay right there!#
KIRK: McCoy! He's in (McCoy comes out and they greet each other enthusiastically. A truck is coming down the street as Edith starts to cross, not looking.)#
KIRK: Edith. (McCoy dashes forward but Kirk grabs him and pulls him back onto the pavement just as Edith and the truck meet in in a squeal of brakes.)#
KIRK: Let's get the hell out of here.#
KIRK: Try GSK-783, sub-space frequency 3.#
KIRK: I'm very well aware of that, Lieutenant. Try it.#
KIRK: Evaluation, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: And next in line, Deneva. Bones, what's your theory about the cause of all this?#
KIRK: But it follows a definite pattern, a systematic progression from planet to planet.#
KIRK: Plot an interception course, Mister Sulu. Warp factor eight. Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact that ship.#
KIRK: Scotty, tractor beams?#
KIRK: Denevan ship, this is the USS Enterprise. Can you reverse your course? Acknowledge.#
KIRK: Keep closing. Denevan ship, reverse your course. Do you hear me? Reverse your course. Acknowledge.#
KIRK: Reverse course. One hundred and eighty degrees about.#
KIRK: Very well. Reduce to sub-warp speed. Take us to Deneva.#
KIRK: That Denevan ship headed deliberately into the sun. Why?#
KIRK: Keep trying.#
KIRK: Put it on audio.#
KIRK: Aurelan, this is Jim on the Enterprise. Repeat your message.#
KIRK: Re-establish.#
KIRK: I'm not interested in your excuses, Lieutenant. Re-establish contact with that transmitter.#
KIRK: Keep trying to raise them.#
KIRK: Yes. You were right a while back. My brother Sam lives on Deneva. He's a research biologist. That woman sounded like his wife Aurelan.#
KIRK: Set your phasers on stun. We're going to beam directly into the capital city. Alert status. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I'll want a complete transcript of everything that happens down there, Yeoman.#
KIRK: Let's go. Energise.#
KIRK: There are almost a million inhabitants of Deneva. There's more than one hundred thousand in this city alone. Where is everyone?#
KIRK: My brother's lab is over there. They signalled us once. There should be someone there. Let's find out what's happening.#
KIRK: Stand by to fire. Fire.#
KIRK: Did you hear what they said, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: They tried to brain us with these clubs. Check them out, Bones.#
KIRK: To say the least.#
KIRK: Fan out. Follow me. Security.#
KIRK:  Aurelan.#
KIRK: Bones.  Aurelan, you're safe now.#
KIRK: Sam. It is my brother. Was my brother.#
KIRK: Peter?#
KIRK: Get ready to beam up.#
KIRK: Yes. Yes, Mister Spock. You heard my sister-in-law say something about they being here. Your guess.#
KIRK: It doesn't make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported. Our sensors didn't pick up anything that didn't belong here.#
KIRK: Take charge of the landing party, Mister Spock. I want some answers to all this.#
KIRK: Can she talk?#
KIRK: Aurelan? Aurelan, it's Jim.#
KIRK: He's dead. But your son's still alive. You've got to help us.#
KIRK: Yes, I'm here. You have to tell us what happened, Aurelan, to you and the others.#
KIRK: Who?#
KIRK: What kind of things?#
KIRK: Aurelan, it's important that you tell us. What kind of things?#
KIRK: My brother's son?#
KIRK: Report.;#
KIRK: You've seen some kind of creature? Any alien form?#
KIRK: All right. Let's go find out what it is. Set your phasers on force three, to kill. We're looking for some kind of creature, and we already know it will kill.#
KIRK: Spock!#
KIRK: Form a ring. Fire! (After a prolonged burst, one falls to the ground and the others fly off.)#
KIRK: And it can bear up under full phaser power.#
KIRK: It's too close in here. It may be a trap in here. Let's move out. (As they head up the stairs, the felled creature revives and lands on Spock's back. He falls back in pain.) KIRK: Spock! Spock!  It's gone. Can you stand? Spock, are you all right? Captain's log supplemental. Whatever the creatures are, they have apparently taken over all the inhabitants of Deneva. Meanwhile, ship's surgeon Doctor McCoy is examining a strange puncture wound left by one of the creatures on Mister Spock's back.#
KIRK: How is he?#
KIRK: Did you operate on Spock in time?#
KIRK: My nephew?#
KIRK: Recommendations?#
KIRK: All decks, security alert. Locate and restrain Mister Spock. He may be dangerous. Use phasers on stun if necessary.#
KIRK: Get him back to the Sickbay. Use security restraints.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: You're only half-Vulcan. What about the human half of you?#
KIRK: Can he control it the way he says, Bones?#
KIRK: I need you, Spock, but we can't take any chances. We'll keep you confined for a while longer. If you can maintain control, we'll see. My nephew. If he regains consciousness, will he go through that?#
KIRK: Help them. I don't care what it takes or costs. You've got to help them.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, I gave you an order to stay in the Sickbay.#
KIRK: Scotty?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, your logic, as usual, is inescapable. Beam him down. Stay in constant touch with us. Give him your phaser. He'll need that, too.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: I don't have to, Bones. We both know he is.#
KIRK: Yes. That would answer a lot of questions.#
KIRK: I think so. This may be one cell in a larger organism. An incredibly huge organism, in fact.#
KIRK: Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it, that it may have come here, planet by planet, from an entirely different galaxy.#
KIRK: But not impossible, Mister Spock. The Denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free, that he'd won. That's the angle to work on, gentlemen. I want an analysis of all this from Medical and Life Science departments within the hour.#
KIRK: Then you're wasting your time. There has to be something that'll kill the creature without destroying the human host.#
KIRK: I can't accept that, Bones. We've got fourteen science labs aboard this ship. The finest equipment and computers in the galaxy.#
KIRK: No, no, Bones. There's more than two lives at stake here. I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying a million people down there. Captain's log, stardate 3289.8. I am faced with the most difficult decision of my life. Unless we find a way to destroy the creatures without killing their human hosts, my command responsibilities will force me to kill over a million people.#
KIRK: Gentlemen.#
KIRK: I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen. I cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet, nor do I intend to kill a million or more people to stop it. I want another answer. I'm putting you gentlemen on the hot seat with me. I want that third alternative.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: Request denied.#
KIRK: Request denied. There must be another answer. Something in the sun killed that thing before the Denevan died. All right. All right. We've tried heat, radiation. What other qualities or properties does the sun have?#
KIRK: But one other thing you haven't mentioned. It's bright. It radiates a blinding light if you're close enough.#
KIRK: Not to us. But down on the surface, the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part. Suppose they weren't simply hiding. Suppose they're sensitive to light. Light, like in a sun, close up.#
KIRK: No, but you can move the equivalent of the sun to Deneva. Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Good. Let's get on it.#
KIRK: Your figures are, of course, accurate.#
KIRK: It worked in a lab. With the creature exposed to everything we can give it. But what about the people who are infected?#
KIRK: Maybe. There's no time for maybes, Bones. We need to know now.#
KIRK: Yes, we'd have to put someone who's infected under that light.#
KIRK: We have to duplicate the conditions on the planet, and Spock#
KIRK: There's no other way, Bones. We have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the Denevan declared himself freed.#
KIRK: I agree completely.#
KIRK: Proceed.#
KIRK: Spock, are you all right?#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Are you telling me that Spock need not have been blinded?#
KIRK: Bones, take care of him.#
KIRK: Good. Scanners?#
KIRK: Satellite control, this is the Captain. Energise all satellites.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: Sickbay.#
KIRK: Tell Spock it worked.#
KIRK: Bones, it wasn't your fault.#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: Yeoman, record this for Starfleet Command.#
KIRK: The alien creatures on Deneva have been destroyed#
KIRK: Spock. You can see.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most. You, I presume, felt nothing?#
KIRK: If you gentlemen are finished, would you mind laying in a course for Starbase Ten, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: What's that, Doctor?#
KIRK: You've been so concerned about his Vulcan eyes, Doctor, you forgot about his Vulcan ears. Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: No, keep it open. I don't like this. Nothing since the first check in. Scott and Sulu should've contacted us again a half an hour ago.#
KIRK: Both those men are well aware of landing party procedure. They should've checked in with us by now.#
KIRK: Enterprise. Kirk here.#
KIRK: One? Jackson, where are Scott and Sulu?#
KIRK: Jackson!#
KIRK: Notify Transporter room to prepare to beam up one member of the landing party. Then have Doctor McCoy report to me in the Transporter room on the double.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Trouble.  Jackson, where are the others?#
KIRK: Odd. Our probe data didn't indicate fog.#
KIRK: Readings, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: What are the ship's sensors reading now, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Lieutenant, can you hear me?#
KIRK: I don't know. There has to be some explanation for the fact that the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking up readings of multiple life forms. Are they still there, Spock?#
KIRK: Stand-by alert.#
KIRK: Quiet. (There's an eerie wailing, then the images of, well, the Three Witches from Macbeth, appear.)#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: Spock. Comment?#
KIRK: A more useful comment, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: That's useful.#
KIRK: That's where we're going.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in.#
KIRK: What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference?#
KIRK: And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.#
KIRK: Could it be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan.#
KIRK: If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead I'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. You'd be a natural. I'll explain it to you one day. Shall we have a look around?#
KIRK:  Bones. Spock.#
KIRK: Straight ahead, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Spock. Are you all right?#
KIRK: Bones?  Doc?#
KIRK: Dungeons, curses, skeletons and iron maidens. They're all Earth manifestations. Why?#
KIRK: None of this parallels any human development. It's more like a human nightmare.#
KIRK: Ghost stories, ogres, demons. The whole (Footsteps, then the dungeon door opens. Down the steps walk - Scott and Sulu! as if in a trance.) KIRK: Scotty, Sulu. Scotty. Put down the phaser. Scotty!#
KIRK: These two are alive. Scotty, do you hear me? Sulu, do you know who I am? What's happened to you?#
KIRK: Whoever you are, you've proven your skill at creating illusion. Now I want to know why and what you've done to my men.#
KIRK: Not when one of my men is dead because of it and two others turned into mindless#
KIRK: Who are you? Why did you bring us here?#
KIRK: Why? For what reason? Why all the mumbo-jumbo?#
KIRK: That cat.#
KIRK: Superstition.#
KIRK: All right, Korob. What do you want from us?#
KIRK: You'll find us most unco-operative unless you start explaining yourself.#
KIRK: We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship. They mean nothing to us.#
KIRK: Whatever it is you read, you read it wrong. As for leaving, we'll leave when we're ready.#
KIRK: Don't move!  Cover them. Now, I want the rest of our weapons and our equipment. I want some answers.#
KIRK: You can't think a man to death.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Come in.#
KIRK: Never mind about us. What's happening up there?#
KIRK: DeSalle, channel bypass power into your heat dissipation units.#
KIRK: All right. I'll handle it down here. Kirk out. (taking the model from Sylvia and the phaser from Spock) You've won.#
KIRK: You seem to be singing a different tune. I'd rather know more about yours. You call it magic, you call it science. It seems unrelated to both of them.#
KIRK: I wouldn't attempt to name it, but you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools. You alter matter, move it about by telekinesis.#
KIRK: It's too late for threats. You let me contact the ship. How long do you think it will it be before a search party arrives?#
KIRK: We have nothing to discuss.#
KIRK: How long has it been?#
KIRK: Thanks. I wonder what they're doing to Doc.#
KIRK: Familiar. Startling. Not rational.#
KIRK: Ghosts, witches.#
KIRK: They tried to tap our conscious mind.#
KIRK: He expected me to react as though it were all normal. Well, he admitted that they weren't native to this planet.#
KIRK: They refer to us as creatures, as though we were some species that they were unfamiliar with. If we're creatures, I wonder what they're really like.#
KIRK: Agreed. Totally alien. And I don't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock. Not at all like friendly visitors. We're going to have to stop them, cold. But at the moment#
KIRK: Oh, Bones. Doc.#
KIRK: What now? You wave your magic wand and destroy my mind, too?#
KIRK: You don't call that damage?#
KIRK: You'd know if you had compassion. A woman should have compassion, but I forget you're not a woman.#
KIRK: You seem to need us. Why?#
KIRK: What about Korob?#
KIRK: Why don't you simply probe my mind and get what you want?#
KIRK: You're very persuasive. What happens if I go along?#
KIRK: For the same reasons you excite me. You're a very beautiful woman.#
KIRK: You have a knack for giving me difficult choices. (kisses her again) You have nothing like that where you come from?#
KIRK: Your people, when they come here#
KIRK:  Transmuter?#
KIRK: Then it's a device. You do use tools.#
KIRK: You haven't changed your mind? You won't return home?#
KIRK: And why not? You've been using me and my crew.#
KIRK: I'm not leaving without my men.#
KIRK: Transmuter. Yes, she mentioned that.#
KIRK: Why a cat?#
KIRK: You'd better let us.  It's out of energy. She must have drained it. We could have jumped Scott and Sulu at any time. We didn't know. No way out.#
KIRK: Do you think you can make it?#
KIRK:  Get ready.#
KIRK: Korob, that door won't last.#
KIRK: Korob seemed to think this was important. Said something about a transmuter.#
KIRK: Doc. (Then Sulu arrives. Spock neck-pinches Scott. Kirk parries Sulu's martial arts attack until he can throw him against a door, when he is knocked out.)#
KIRK: Well, at least we found them.#
KIRK: Maybe we do.  Sylvia, I have the transmuter. It's mine now.#
KIRK: Don't you get tired of these games?#
KIRK: I wasn't sure before, but I am now. This is the source of your power, isn't it. The transmuter.#
KIRK: I catch on quickly.#
KIRK: Why? Because your people have nothing of your own? Is that why you need us?#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: I don't know what you are but you're not a woman. You've tortured my men and taken their minds from them. You ask for love and return pain instead.#
KIRK: That'll take some explaining, Bones.#
KIRK: Not everything. (By his feet are two tiny blue fluffy creatures with stick-thin arms and legs, and squid's tentacles for faces.) KIRK: Korob and Sylvia as they really are. Their forms were an illusion, just like the castle and everything else. Only the power pack gave them reality.#
KIRK: No illusion. Jackson is dead. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: Five to beam up.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: How is she, Doc?#
KIRK: Commissioner, I can assure you that once we reach the Enterprise, with its medical facilities, we'll have you back to your job in time for you to prevent that war.#
KIRK: In exactly four hours, twenty one minutes, Commissioner.#
KIRK: Yes?#
KIRK: That's odd. I've never seen anything like that before.#
KIRK: Staying right with us. Sensor readings, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: We've got it.#
KIRK: Neither do the pods. Communications are dead. Building overload. Cut all power relays.#
KIRK: You already know as much as we do, Miss Hedford. Whatever that thing is outside, it's yanked us off course from the Enterprise.#
KIRK: I know, Bones, but there's nothing I can do about it.#
KIRK: Miss Hedford, we'll do what we can, when we can. At the moment, we're helpless. You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride.#
KIRK: Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please, come in. Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please. It's no good. We're not transmitting. Bones?#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: All right, we get out and get up. Issue phasers. Bones, maintain full alert. Commissioner, you'll stay inside.#
KIRK: That's a very good question. I wish I could answer it. All right. Let's go.#
KIRK: Take a look around, Bones.#
KIRK: Nothing wrong and nothing works.#
KIRK: There must be a reason.#
KIRK: Let's look a little further.#
KIRK: Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is.#
KIRK: We're real enough.#
KIRK: From the Federation.#
KIRK: I'm Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. This is my first officer Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Chief Surgeon Leonard McCoy.#
KIRK: Oh, and excuse me, Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford.#
KIRK: Mister Cochrane. We were forced off our course and taken here by some force we couldn't identify.#
KIRK: What about you, Cochrane? How did you get here?#
KIRK: If you don't mind, Mister Cochrane, I'd like more than just a statement that you were marooned here. It's a long way off the beaten path.#
KIRK: Yes, she is. And you've been out of circulation quite a while. The principles may be new to you. Mister Spock, why don't you explain our methods of propulsion to Mister Cochrane?#
KIRK: I've noticed something else.#
KIRK: He looks familiar.#
KIRK: I can't quite place him, but. What about Miss Hedford?#
KIRK: Take Cochrane up on his offer.#
KIRK: All the comforts of home indeed, Mister Cochrane. Where'd you get the antiques?#
KIRK: Not that much.#
KIRK: Yes, I know. It means we're running out of time.#
KIRK: What was that?#
KIRK: You'll find I have a very low tolerance level where the safety of my people are concerned. We find you out here, where no human has any business being. We were virtually hijacked in space and brought here. Now I'm not just requesting an explanation, Mister. I'm demanding one.#
KIRK: The what?#
KIRK: You seem perfectly all right now. What was the matter?#
KIRK: You were what?#
KIRK: Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name?#
KIRK: Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centuri, the discoverer of the space warp?#
KIRK: Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane?#
KIRK: You say this Companion found you and rejuvenated you? What were you doing in space at the age of eighty seven?#
KIRK: How long do we have?#
KIRK: Mister Cochrane, you say you were brought here a hundred and fifty years ago? You don't look over thirty five.#
KIRK: You say you can communicate with it. Perhaps you can find out what we're doing here.#
KIRK: You wouldn't mind telling us?#
KIRK: I already don't like it.#
KIRK: You mean you brought us here?#
KIRK: Spock, run additional tricorder readings. Learn anything you can. Find me a weapon to use against this thing.#
KIRK: I intend to do whatever's necessary to get us off this planet and Commissioner Hedford to the hospital. If the Companion stands in the way, then we push it out of the way. Clear, Spock?#
KIRK: Very well. You have your orders.  Mister Cochrane, if you left here, what would happen to you?#
KIRK: Do you want to leave here?#
KIRK: We're on a thousand planets and spreading out. We cross fantastic distances and everything's alive, Cochrane. Life everywhere. We estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life. We haven't begun to map them. Interesting?#
KIRK: It's all out there waiting for you, but we'll need your help to get away.#
KIRK: You seem to think this Companion of yours can do almost anything.#
KIRK: Could it cure her?#
KIRK: How do you communicate with it?#
KIRK: We've got to try. We're helpless. See if it can do something.#
KIRK: How do you do it?#
KIRK: Bones, what do you make of that?#
KIRK: Exactly what I think. Not exactly like a pet owner speaking to a beloved animal, would you#
KIRK: Agreed. More like love.#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: Then she'll die.#
KIRK: It troubles you, Cochrane?#
KIRK: It's also keeping you prisoner.#
KIRK: We're getting out of here, Cochrane. Face up to it. I'll do anything I have to to save all of our lives.#
KIRK: Please. Outside.#
KIRK: Nor it ours.#
KIRK: Now. (The jolt knocks Cochrane out and the Companion comes towards the dwelling, apparently angry.)#
KIRK: Yeah.#
KIRK: Cochrane got it off of us, but I don't know whether he did us a favour or not.#
KIRK: How do you fight a thing like that? I've got a ship up there somewhere, responsibility for four lives here, one of them dying because of me.#
KIRK: I'm in command, Bones. It makes it my fault. How do you fight a thing like that?#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: The universal translator on the shuttlecraft. We can try that, talk to that thing.#
KIRK: Adjust it, change it. The trouble with immortality is it's boring. Adjusting the translator will give you something to do.#
KIRK: Right down your alley, Spock. Get it here and get to work. That thing is still out there. Better go that way.#
KIRK: Any change?#
KIRK: There are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all intelligent life. This device instantaneously compares the frequency of brainwave patterns, selects those ideas and concepts it recognises, and then provides the necessary grammar.#
KIRK: With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end. Not one hundred percent efficient, but nothing ever is. Ready, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Mister Cochrane, call the Companion.#
KIRK: Companion.  We wish to talk to you.#
KIRK: Feminine. No doubt about it.#
KIRK: I'm way ahead of you.#
KIRK: No. A lover. Companion. It is wrong to keep us here against our will.#
KIRK: One of us will cease to exist if we don't get her to a place where we can care for her.#
KIRK: Companion, try to understand. It is the nature of our species to be free, just as it is your nature to stay here. We will cease to exist in captivity.#
KIRK: This isn't a classroom. I'm trying to get us out of here.#
KIRK: This isn't the time. Companion, what you offer us is not continuation. It is non=existence. We will cease to exist. Even the man will cease to exist.#
KIRK: We didn't.#
KIRK: The idea of male and female are universal constants, Cochrane. There's no doubt about it. The Companion is female.#
KIRK: What are you complaining about? It kept you alive.#
KIRK: Companion, do you love the man?#
KIRK: Is he important to you, more important than anything? Is he as though he were a part of you?#
KIRK: He will not continue. He will cease to exist. By your feeling for him, you are condemning him to an existence he will find unbearable. He will cease to exist.#
KIRK: You speak of his body. I speak of his spirit. Companion, inside the shelter, a female of our species is dying. She will not continue. That is what will happen to the man unless you release all of us.#
KIRK: Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. You take away all obstacles. Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die. You regard the man only as a toy. You amuse yourself with him.#
KIRK: But you can't really love him. You haven't the slightest knowledge of love, the total union of two people. You are the Companion. He is the man. You are two different things. You can't join. You can't love. You may keep him here forever, but you will always be separate, apart from him.#
KIRK: Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it. Love sometimes expresses itself in sacrifice. I thought maybe if she loved him, she'd let him go.#
KIRK: I tried.#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: We?#
KIRK: Spock, check out the shuttlecraft. Engine, communications, everything.#
KIRK: Go ahead, Cochrane We have a few things to do.#
KIRK: Perfectly all right. Can you get a fix on us.#
KIRK: Very good. I'll continue transmitting. Assume standard orbit when you arrive. We'll transport up in the shuttlecraft.#
KIRK: Interesting story, Scotty. I can't tell you now because, quite frankly, I don't know how it's going to end. Kirk out. (Somewhere in the vicinity, Nancy is holding up her scarf to mimic how she saw Cochrane when she was a swirly thing.)#
KIRK: Stand by, Scotty.#
KIRK: The Enterprise is waiting, Mister Cochrane.#
KIRK: Think it over, Mister Cochrane. There's a whole galaxy out there waiting to honour you.#
KIRK: Are you sure?#
KIRK: All the best.#
KIRK: Not a word, Mister Cochrane.#
KIRK: Well, I'm sure the Federation can find another woman somewhere who'll stop that war.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Sulu. Report.#
KIRK: Very good. Have the transporter room stand by.#
KIRK: Analysis, gentlemen.#
KIRK: Yes, but in this case, with the more people we take down, the greater chance we have of violating one of their taboos.#
KIRK: Very well. Scotty, you're in command. Bear in mind that the Klingons have been sighted in this sector. While we're negotiating down there, we don't want the Enterprise to become an incident up here.#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: Grant, no!#
KIRK: He was young, and inexperienced.#
KIRK: Let me call my ship and inform them#
KIRK: So they keep their word scrupulously. They're unusually honest. Is that what I heard you say, Doctor?#
KIRK: Dangerous if lied to, if their customs are violated. We lied to no one, Doctor. We violated no customs. Perhaps you'll explain to me why one of my men is dead.#
KIRK: Grant looked up, saw a Klingon, made a purely instinctive defensive move. What's a Klingon doing down here among your scrupulously honest friends anyway?#
KIRK: That's only one down, Doctor. There's over four hundred more up there in orbit. And if there's a Klingon down here, there might be a Klingon ship up there somewhere.#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: I shouldn't have chewed you out. I'm sorry.#
KIRK: Yes, you're quite right, Mister Spock. Inefficient and illogical.#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. First of all, I must protest the killing of my crewman.#
KIRK: The Earth Federation offers one other thing, Akaar. Our laws. And the highest of all our laws states that your world is yours and will always remain yours. This differs us from the Klingons. Their empire is made up of conquered worlds. They take what they want by arms and force.#
KIRK: We need our communicators, those devices on our belts. If there's a Klingon ship somewhere#
KIRK: Klingon! Communicators, weapons.#
KIRK: Type of vessel. Location.#
KIRK: Wait. If you lead these people now, be certain you make the right decisions.#
KIRK: Or let the Klingon and me fight. It might amuse you.#
KIRK: No!#
KIRK: I must assume that something's keeping them busy up there. The Klingon ship.#
KIRK: That's a very good idea, Bones.#
KIRK:  You said you're prepared to die. Does that mean you'd prefer to die? I think we can get you safely to the ship. Your choice. Bones.#
KIRK: All right. Let's go.#
KIRK: Stay with her, Bones. Nice place to get trapped in.#
KIRK: Yes, I see. Scout up the trail that way. See what we have in the way of an exit. I'll take a look around.#
KIRK: Good. If we could block off that entrance, hold them off, it'd give us more time. They'd have to go around these hills.#
KIRK: Do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of our communicators?#
KIRK: Well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try.#
KIRK: Worried about the delivery?#
KIRK: Well, if you don't think you can handle it#
KIRK: There's a cave in there. Probably the only shelter around here.#
KIRK: Bones, you've got one of those magnesite-nitron tablets in your kit. Give me one.#
KIRK: How did you arrange to touch her, Bones, give her a happy pill?#
KIRK: Never seen that in a medical book.#
KIRK: Vegetation, Captain. Evidently there's water nearby. KIRK: Good, but we need weapons just as much as we need water, Spock.#
KIRK: Follow me.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: You mean it makes a good bowstring.#
KIRK: That's more like it. Since the Capellans never developed the bow, this may come as big a surprise as gunpowder was on Earth.#
KIRK: Our child?#
KIRK: What happened, Bones?#
KIRK: Bones, you took a medical oath long before you signed aboard my ship. That small patient in there needs you.#
KIRK: Spock. Spock!#
KIRK: The cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time anymore.#
KIRK: There's just one thing I want.#
KIRK: One of us must get him.#
KIRK: Why not?#
KIRK: Klingon!#
KIRK: We missed you, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: An obscure Earth dialect, Mister Spock. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. If you're curious, consult linguistics.#
KIRK: Interesting?#
KIRK: We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Contact Starfleet. Inform them the Federation mining rights on Capella have been secured by treaty, documents signed by the young high chief's regent. Report follows.#
KIRK: Yes, Eleen. Remarkable young lady.#
KIRK: Yes. I think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history, Leonard. What do you think, Spock?#
KIRK: Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Ahead warp factor one.#
KIRK: Bugs the? Well, carry out the standard procedures on Pollux Four.#
KIRK: Bones, could you get that excited over a cup of coffee?#
KIRK: Why, Bones? Scotty's a good man.#
KIRK: I like to think of it not so much losing an officer as gaining#
KIRK: Actually, I'm losing an officer.#
KIRK: Cartographic Detail, stand by.#
KIRK: Preliminary reports, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Cartographic Sections, implement standard orders.#
KIRK: Analysis, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: What is it, Mister Spock? Is it a hand?#
KIRK: A trick, then? A projection?#
KIRK: Hard about.#
KIRK: Reverse all engines.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, relay our position and circumstances to Starbase Twelve immediately.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu try rocking the ship. Full impulse power forward and back.#
KIRK: Thank you. Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Status.#
KIRK: Thank you. Mister Sulu. Our forward tractor beams, adjust to repel.#
KIRK: Activate.#
KIRK: Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Response frequencies, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: This is Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the USS Enterprise. Please identify yourself.#
KIRK: Are you responsible for stopping the ship?#
KIRK: Give it back, then we'll talk.#
KIRK: I don't know who or what you are, but I must warn you we have the power to defend ourselves. If you value your safety, release this ship.#
KIRK: Never mind the history lesson. Release the ship!#
KIRK: Compensate.#
KIRK: All right! Whatever you're doing, turn it off! You win!#
KIRK: Let's go, Bones. You in good voice?#
KIRK: If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell where this ship used to be.#
KIRK: Insulted, Spock?#
KIRK: Good. We'll tackle him together. We already know the questions. You're the best man to find the answers.#
KIRK: Tricorders.#
KIRK: Come on.#
KIRK: You know of Earth? You've been there?#
KIRK: You mentioned Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus. How do you know about them?#
KIRK: Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: And you haven't yet. Readings, Doctor.#
KIRK: Evidently not so simple.#
KIRK: All right. We're here at your invitation. Would you mind telling us what you want without all the Olympian generalities?#
KIRK: Transporter room.#
KIRK: Enterprise, come in.#
KIRK: What is it you want?#
KIRK: If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your business, but you're no god to us, Mister.#
KIRK: And you've got a lot to learn!#
KIRK: Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo?#
KIRK: And this thing?#
KIRK: I think the appearance of this is for our benefit. Bones?#
KIRK: Fine, but what power, and where is it? Scout around with your tricorders. Find the source of that power. Bones.#
KIRK: Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago#
KIRK: I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo?#
KIRK: Apollo, we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks.#
KIRK: I have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there.#
KIRK: Scotty.  Very impressive. How'd you do it?#
KIRK: Bones, how is he?#
KIRK: He would have been rather difficult to stop.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation.#
KIRK: How do you feel, Scotty?#
KIRK: It would seem so.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, I understand your concern over her, but she volunteered to go with him, hopefully to find out more about him. She's doing her job. I think it's about time you started doing yours. We've got to find out the source of his power. You've got a tricorder. Use it if you're able to.#
KIRK: And one more thing. I want no more unauthorised action against Apollo or whatever he is. That's an order!#
KIRK: Besides, you stiff-necked thistle head, you could have gotten yourself killed.#
KIRK: Apollo's no god. But he could have been taken for one, though, once. Say five thousand years ago, a highly sophisticated group of space travellers landed on Earth around the Mediterranean.#
KIRK: Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and command great energy. In fact, they couldn't have been taken for anything else.#
KIRK: I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir.#
KIRK: Apollo has no difficulty focusing. He taps that energy, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps a flow of energy and channels it through his body?#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week. But where is the source of that power?#
KIRK: Is that all you have to offer?#
KIRK: Bones, is it possible#
KIRK: Where's Lieutenant Palamas?#
KIRK: Scotty!#
KIRK: All right, mister. You wanted worshippers? You've got enemies. You want us to bow down, you'll have to#
KIRK: Take care of Scotty.#
KIRK: Where's Apollo?#
KIRK: Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat?#
KIRK: All right, all right, all right.#
KIRK: Very good, Mister Chekov. That might very well mean something.#
KIRK: We've got to get out of here.#
KIRK: Well, let's assume that five thousand years ago creatures like our friend Apollo did indeed visit Earth and form the basis of the Greek classic myths.#
KIRK: Most mythology has its basis in fact. If I remember my ancient legends, the gods, after expending energy, required rest, even as we humans.#
KIRK: Something like that. Remember, he's keeping a force field on the ship and he's expending energy down here. You said he looked pained and tired when he disappeared. If we can wear him out, overwork him, that might do it.#
KIRK: If we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again, there's a chance that he'll be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him.#
KIRK: Not all of us, Bones. When he comes back, it's a chance we'll have to take.#
KIRK: You know nothing about our kind. You know only our remote ancestors who trembled before your tricks. Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you. We've come a long way in five thousand years.#
KIRK: Mankind has no need for gods. We find the one quite adequate.#
KIRK: We're busy.  Look after the girl.#
KIRK: Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking!#
KIRK: Lieutenant, get back.#
KIRK: We're tired of your phony fireworks!#
KIRK: Lieutenant!#
KIRK: Lieutenant!#
KIRK: Lieutenant.#
KIRK: And you will supply the herds of sheep, and the pipes we'll play, and the simple skins we'll wear for clothes.#
KIRK: We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved us.#
KIRK: Yes, I have. One more. And it depends on the lieutenant's loyalty. If she fails us, we'd better get used to herding goats.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Kirk to#
KIRK: Scotty, I'll find out.#
KIRK: How old are you?#
KIRK: Then I'd better handle it. (goes over to a very satisfied looking woman) You all right?#
KIRK: Come over there. Well?#
KIRK: All right, Lieutenant, you can come down from Mount Olympus now. You've got work to do.#
KIRK: He thrives on love, worship, attention.#
KIRK: We can't give him that worship, none of us can. Especially you.#
KIRK: Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him.#
KIRK: Lieutenant. All our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you.#
KIRK: On you, Lieutenant! Reject him, and we have a chance to save ourselves. Accept him, and you condemn all of us to slavery, nothing less than slavery. We might never get help this far out. Or perhaps the thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals to you.#
KIRK: Give me your hand. Your hand.  Now feel that. Human flesh against human flesh. We're the same. We share the same history, the same heritage, the same lives. We're tied together beyond any untying. Man or woman, it makes no difference. We're human. We couldn't escape from each other even if we wanted to. That's how you do it, Lieutenant. By remembering who and what you are. A bit of flesh and blood afloat in a universe without end. The only thing that's truly yours is the rest of humanity. That's where our duty lies. Do you understand me?#
KIRK: Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: There is indeed, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Very good. How are you doing on the force field?#
KIRK: Well, that ought to do it. Have Sulu lock all phaser banks onto the structure. Fire on my order only. Cut it fine. We'll be standing nearby. ]Bridge]#
KIRK: If that structure is the source of his power, I want to know where he is when we attack it.#
KIRK: Bones, do you think that mysterious organ in Apollo's chest could have something to do with the transmission of energy?#
KIRK: Yes, I know. I know. Scotty. We'll wait.#
KIRK:  Kirk here.#
KIRK: Stand by your phasers, Mister Spock. Prepare to fire on my signal. Kirk out.#
KIRK: We've got to be here when he comes back.#
KIRK: Scotty, just hold on! (Carolyn falls to the ground in the strong winds, and a giant image of Apollo looms over her amid the lightning flashes.)#
KIRK: All right. The temple is his power source. Let's bring him back to it. Get to cover. Mister Spock, fire those phasers.#
KIRK: Fire those phasers! That's an order, Mister Spock!#
KIRK: Scotty!#
KIRK: We've out grown you. You asked for something we could no longer give.#
KIRK: So do I. They gave us so much. The Greek civilisation, much of our culture and philosophy came from a worship of those beings. In a way, they began the Golden Age. Would it have hurt us, I wonder, just to have gathered a few laurel leaves?#
KIRK: A minute.#
KIRK: No, nothing in particular. Why ?#
KIRK: That just sounds like Mister Spock in one of his contemplative phases.#
KIRK: Bones, I'm a busy man.#
KIRK: Spock said that?#
KIRK: Spock, what the devil is this all about?#
KIRK: All right, Spock, let's have it.#
KIRK: I'm more interested in your request for shore leave. In all the years#
KIRK: In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a leave of any sort. In fact, you've refused them. Why now?#
KIRK: Agreed, but that isn't the question, is it? If there's a problem of some sort, illness in the family#
KIRK: Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore facilities there are excellent#
KIRK: Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong?#
KIRK: Bridge. Helm.#
KIRK: Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four.#
KIRK: I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible.#
KIRK: Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance.#
KIRK: Head directly for Altair Six. Sailor's luck, Mister Spock. Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it, 'Any home port the ship makes ill be somebody else's, not mine'. The new president of Altair Six wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early. Don't worry. I'll see that you get your leave as soon as we're finished.#
KIRK: Bridge. Navigation.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mister Spock?#
KIRK: How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us?#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Come with me, please.#
KIRK: Deck five. You've changed course for Vulcan, Mister Spock. Why?#
KIRK: Do you deny it?#
KIRK: Then why'd you do it?#
KIRK: I'm trying to help you, Spock.#
KIRK: I order you to report to the Sickbay.#
KIRK: Complete examination. McCoy's waiting.#
KIRK: Bones, I will, I will. As soon as this mission is#
KIRK: Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain.#
KIRK: You keep saying that. Are you a doctor, or aren't you?#
KIRK: You say you're convinced he knows what it is?#
KIRK: Stay. McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition. He says you're going to die unless something is done. What? Is it something only your planet can do for you? Spock! You've been called the best first officer in the fleet. That's an enormous asset to me. If I have to lose that first officer, I want to know why.#
KIRK: No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order.#
KIRK: Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential?#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: What kind of biology?#
KIRK: You mean the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction? Well, there's no need to be embarrassed about it, Mister Spock. It happens to the birds and the bees.#
KIRK: I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically.#
KIRK: But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're#
KIRK: I haven't heard a word you've said, and I'll get you to Vulcan somehow.#
KIRK: I'm aware of that, sir, but it's of the utmost importance. You must give me permission to divert to Vulcan.#
KIRK: I can't, sir, but believe me, I wouldn't make such a request#
KIRK: Sir, the delay would be, at most, a day. I can hardly believe that#
KIRK: No, it's not. I know the Altair situation. We would be one of three starships. Very impressive, very diplomatic, but it's simply not that vital.#
KIRK: I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to Altair. I owe him my life a dozen times over. Isn't that worth a career? He's my friend. Bridge. Navigation.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Vulcan. Tell Engineering I want warp eight or better. Push her for all she'll take.#
KIRK: I see. Very well. Carry on, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out.#
KIRK: Bridge.#
KIRK: Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness.#
KIRK: Is it permitted?#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Open the channel, Lieutenant. Vulcan Space Central, this is the USS Enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit.#
KIRK: He described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge. In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates.#
KIRK: It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler.#
KIRK: The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.#
KIRK: Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife.#
KIRK: Bones, you know who that is? T'Pau. The only person to ever turn down a seat on the Federation Council.#
KIRK: He never mentioned that his family was this important. (T'Pau's chair is placed on a dais, and Spock greets her. She gives him a quick mind-meld.)#
KIRK: Ma'am.#
KIRK: What is it? What happened?#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: We'll stay.#
KIRK: Think Spock can take him?#
KIRK: What happens to Spock if I decline?#
KIRK: I can't?#
KIRK: And you said Spock might not be able to handle him. If I can knock Spock out without really hurting him#
KIRK: If I get into any trouble, I'll quit. And Spock wins, and honour is satisfied.#
KIRK: Bones. He's my first officer and my friend. I disregarded Starfleet orders to bring him here. Another thing, that's T'Pau of Vulcan. All of Vulcan in one package. How can I back out in front of her?#
KIRK: I accept the challenge.#
KIRK: What do you mean, if both survive?#
KIRK: Now wait a minute, ma'am. Who said anything about a fight to the death?#
KIRK: Kill Spock? That's not what I came to Vulcan for, is it? What's that?#
KIRK: Sound medical advice.#
KIRK: Don't you think you better check with me first?#
KIRK: Blame McCoy. That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with. He slipped in a neural paralyser. Knocked me out, simulated death.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Relay it, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Well, a little late, but I'm glad they're seeing it our way. How about that T'Pau? They couldn't turn her down. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Altair Six. Leave orbit when ready. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. I understand.#
KIRK: Come on, Spock. Let's go mind the store.#
KIRK: Can you pinpoint it any closer, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: But that's incredible. The star in this system is still intact. Only a nova could destroy like that.#
KIRK: Continue a search pattern.#
KIRK: Every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble and still no sign of the Constellation. Matt Decker's in command. What could have happened to him?#
KIRK: Try to raise it, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Approach course, Mister Sulu. (They arrive at a ship hanging crookedly in space. It looks identical to Enterprise.) KIRK: It's the Constellation. Look at that.#
KIRK: She was attacked. Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations!#
KIRK: Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Very good. Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for any other vessel.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Palmer.#
KIRK: Keep trying. Mister Spock, full evaluation of the damage to the Constellation.#
KIRK: Life support systems?#
KIRK: Radiation levels?#
KIRK: All hands, go to Yellow Alert. Stand by battle stations. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, and a damage control party report to me in the transporter room.#
KIRK: We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command.#
KIRK: Scotty, check the phaser banks. See if they've been fired. Bones, you come with me.#
KIRK: No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee. Whatever happened didn't happen without a warning.#
KIRK: The crew wasn't abducted, they just left. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: No survivors, no bodies either.#
KIRK: We'll continue our search. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Phaser banks?#
KIRK: But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative.#
KIRK: Matt. Matt, it's Jim Kirk.#
KIRK: Matt? Matt.#
KIRK: What happened to your ship, Matt?#
KIRK: What thing? What was it?#
KIRK: Answer me! What was it? What happened, Matt?#
KIRK: Go.#
KIRK: The fourth planet. Only two left now. Scotty, pull the microtapes from the sensor memory banks and beam them aboard to Spock. I want a full analysis, a complete report of what happened when they went in on that planet.#
KIRK: What happened to your crew?#
KIRK: What hit? What attacked you?#
KIRK: Matt, where's your crew?#
KIRK: There is no third planet.#
KIRK: Go.#
KIRK: Deactivated? Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening field do that, and would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference?#
KIRK: What does it look like?#
KIRK: What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive, or is it#
KIRK: Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up. You went in to investigate.#
KIRK: Did you run a scanner check on it? What kind of a beam?#
KIRK:  Kirk here.#
KIRK: What about the Constellation's tapes?#
KIRK: A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. Why?#
KIRK: Thank you. Stand by, Mister Spock. Kirk out.#
KIRK: We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy.#
KIRK: Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine?#
KIRK: It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff. It's never meant to be used. So strong, it could destroy both sides in a war. Something like the old H-Bomb was supposed to be. That's what I think this is. A doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago. They don't exist anymore, but the machine is still destroying.#
KIRK: Take it easy.#
KIRK: There's no ship to leave. It's a dead hulk! We'll take her in tow. I'll stay onboard and get her ready. You go back to the Enterprise with the doctor and let him help you.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Have the transporter room beam Doctor McCoy and Commodore Decker on board immediately.#
KIRK: Whatever it is, we can't let it go beyond us to the next solar system. We have to stop it. If it's a robot, what are the chances of deactivating it?#
KIRK: All right. Lower your deflector screens Long enough to beam us aboard.#
KIRK: Spock? Spock? Come in, Spock. Spock? We're stuck, blind, and deaf.#
KIRK: Well, we just can't stand around while our ship is being attacked. Scotty, you've got to get me some manoeuvering power.#
KIRK: Then get me impulse power. Half-speed, quarter-speed, anything. If we get this hulk moving, maybe we can do something.#
KIRK: Then get moving.#
KIRK: Washburn, you get in there. Let's see what we can do about this viewing screen. I've got to find out what's happening out there.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: You worry about your miracles, Scotty, I'll worry about mine. Get to work.#
KIRK: Washburn, try the 2G6 circuit.#
KIRK: Ready to give it a try?#
KIRK: Scotty, how you doing?#
KIRK: Yes, I think (an image of tiny Enterprise and the giant planet killer comes on screen) What the devil's going on?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, come in. Mister Spock, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, where's that power?#
KIRK: Washburn, get down to Engineering. Assist Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Scotty, push it right to the edge. This ship has got to manoeuver.#
KIRK: Scotty, give me that power.#
KIRK: That'll do. Full ahead, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: That's it, Mister Scott. Keep that power coming.#
KIRK: Keep pouring it on, Scotty.#
KIRK: We're moving, the Enterprise isn't. Maybe that thing will see us and let the Enterprise go. If I only had some phasers.#
KIRK: Scotty, you've just earned your pay for the week. Stand by. Fire phasers.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, it worked. Great. (sees that maw turning towards them) I think it's great. Scotty, get us out of here.#
KIRK: Matt. What's going on? Give me Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Give me Spock.#
KIRK: There's only one thing I want to say to you, Commodore. Get my ship out of there.#
KIRK: How long to repair warp drive?#
KIRK: Take evasive action, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately. That's a direct order.#
KIRK: Blast regulations! Mister Spock, I order you to assume command on my personal authority as Captain of the Enterprise.#
KIRK: Fine. Just make sure you stay ahead of it. (Back on the Enterprise, Decker fights Montgomery when they exit turbolift two. It takes a while, but eventually the red-shirt is knocked out and dragged into a side room. Decker then makes his way to the shuttlecraft hangar deck.)#
KIRK: Yes, Scotty.#
KIRK: Keep it going, Scotty, keep it going. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I'm plotting an intercept course. Will rendezvous with you at fourteen thirteen point seven hours.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Why are you launching a shuttlecraft?#
KIRK: This is Kirk. Matt, you'll be killed.#
KIRK: No one expects you to die for an error in judgment.#
KIRK: Matt. Matt, listen to me. You can't throw your life away like this. Matt, you're a starship commander. That makes you a valuable commodity.#
KIRK: We're stronger with you than without you! (The shuttlecraft enters the planet killer, and Decker dies in agony from the radiation.)#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: It's regrettable that he died for nothing.#
KIRK: Negative.#
KIRK: Except possibly the destruction of that thing out there. Carry out your orders, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Spock, listen. Maybe Matt Decker didn't die for nothing. He had the right idea but not enough power to do it. Am I correct in assuming that a fusion explosion of ninety seven megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded?#
KIRK: Ninety seven point eight three five. Will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there?#
KIRK: Not through it, Spock, from inside it. Will it be enough?#
KIRK: Do the best you can and make it fast. Kirk to Scott.#
KIRK: Good. Scotty, can you set the ship's impulse engines to overload?#
KIRK: Set it and get up here as fast as you can.#
KIRK: Spock, you don't know?#
KIRK: I intend to get a lot closer. I'm going to ram her right down that thing's throat.#
KIRK: No. No, I don't intend to die, Mister Spock. We've rigged a delay detonation device. You'll have thirty seconds to beam me aboard the Enterprise before the Constellation's impulse engines blow.#
KIRK: A calculated risk, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out.#
KIRK: What about the detonator?#
KIRK: Understood. Mister Spock. Prepare to beam Scotty on board.#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: I can't. Power level's dropping too fast. You'd better hurry.#
KIRK: Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal.#
KIRK: Beam me aboard.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, beam me aboard.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, ease us back to minimum headway. Conserve power as much as possible. Lieutenant Palmer, tell Mister Scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive. Poor Matt. He gave his life in an attempt to save others. Not the worst way to go.#
KIRK: Indeed it shall, Mister Spock. Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the 20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine. Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes.#
KIRK: Well, I certainly hope not. I found one quite sufficient.#
KIRK: Obviously a man of good taste.#
KIRK: Yes, yes, yes. The Argelians think very highly of their pleasure.#
KIRK: Do you like her, Scotty?#
KIRK: Good. I've invited her to join us at the table. I thought you might like to meet her.#
KIRK: Scotty, Scotty. In Argelius they use the lights.#
KIRK: Have one of our pillows?#
KIRK: We won't leave without you, Scotty. Relax and enjoy yourself. My work is never done.#
KIRK: Physically he's all right. Am I right in assuming that?#
KIRK: He seems he's overcoming his resentment.#
KIRK: Mission accomplished as far as Scotty is concerned. Bones, I know a little place across town where the women#
KIRK: Stabbed, a dozen times. (And standing by a wall, groaning, with a bloody knife in his hand, is Montgomery Scott. Captain's log, stardate 3614.9. Planet Argelius Two. While on therapeutic shore leave, Mister Scott has fallen under suspicion of having brutally murdered an Argelian woman. The chief city administrator, Mister Hengist, has taken charge of the investigation, but has learned little of value.#
KIRK: We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist.#
KIRK: Scotty, you left the cafe with the girl. Do you remember that? What happened next?#
KIRK: Scotty, you've got to remember.#
KIRK: I know a murder's been committed.#
KIRK: It doesn't make any difference what I think.#
KIRK: Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility. This happened under Argelian jurisdiction. If they want to arrest him, try him, even convict him, I have to go along with it.#
KIRK: We'll do what we can.#
KIRK: Yes. Mister Hengist, there were other people in the cafe about the time of the murder. Several of them left just before Mister Scott and the girl did.#
KIRK: What's the law in these cases?#
KIRK: Yes, we've heard of it. I assumed it was a lost art.#
KIRK: Depending on your wife's empathic abilities is all very well, Prefect, but there's only one way we can find out what it is Mister Scott cannot remember. Since you find it impossible to let us go back up to our ship, I can beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder, please. Use these co-ordinates.#
KIRK: Kirk out.#
KIRK: Well, that would be most unfortunate. Argelian hospitality is well-known, as well as its strategic importance as a space port.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, I want a twenty four hour regressive memory check made on Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Scotty, co-operate completely with Lieutenant Tracy. Maybe we'll clear this thing up.#
KIRK: But that blow on the head. It could put all his previous behaviour patterns into the junk heap.#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: The knife? No.#
KIRK: Scotty.#
KIRK: Stabbed over and over again.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Tracy is dead, Scott. You were found alone in the room.#
KIRK: What happened down there?#
KIRK: That head injury. Think, Scotty.#
KIRK: There's no way into that place from up here. Prefect, is there another entrance to that chamber?#
KIRK: Check it. (McCoy leaves and Hengist enters. He is accompanied by the man from the next table and one of the musicians.)#
KIRK: Where've they been during the past few minutes?#
KIRK: There's been another murder, Hengist. One of my crew.#
KIRK: Stabbed. And there's no sign of the weapon.#
KIRK: You. You were a musician at the cafe. You played for the murdered girl.#
KIRK: And you. You left the cafe before Scott and Kara.#
KIRK: Did you know Kara?#
KIRK: Jealousy has often been a motive for murder.#
KIRK: Can you prove you went directly home?#
KIRK: Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there.#
KIRK: Well of course I'm trying to save my friend, if he's innocent. And he hasn't been proven guilty.#
KIRK: On one condition, Prefect. That the room be sealed so that no one can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.  Yes, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: What do you suggest, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: These are a proud people. They have their own customs, their own laws, and while we're here we're subject to them. It is absolutely imperative that this matter be resolved according to Argelian law. Is that clear?#
KIRK: I don't like it any more than you do, Spock, but there's nothing we can do about it. Kirk out,#
KIRK: Three murders, and Scotty the only possible answer each time.#
KIRK: Normally, no, but that blow on his head could#
KIRK: But not responsible.#
KIRK: We can prove it, if he's insane.#
KIRK: That's what we hope to find out, sir.#
KIRK: Mister Hengist. On the Enterprise, we can make a recording of the registrations of Mister Scott's conscious and subconscious mind. They will tell us what happened to him in the recent past.#
KIRK: No doubt will remain.#
KIRK: Each testifier will sit here, place his hand on this plate. Any deviation from factual truth will be immediately detected and relayed to this computer which will in turn notify us. Doctor McCoy has already fed the computer his medical reports. Our laboratory experts are examining the murder weapon and will give their data to the computers for analysis. Shall we begin?#
KIRK: Mister Scott, will you take the stand? (Scott sits on the raised chair and puts his right hand on the sensor plate. Yet at no time does the camera let us see all his finger.) KIRK: Computer, identify verification.#
KIRK: Subject's present physical condition.#
KIRK: Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia?#
KIRK: Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory.#
KIRK: Computer, accuracy scan.#
KIRK: All right, Scotty, let's have it.#
KIRK: Something? You mean someone.#
KIRK: Computer.#
KIRK: All right. Let's hit it on the head. Scotty, did you kill Sybo?#
KIRK: Scotty, lie to me. How old are you?#
KIRK: After the lights went out, Mister Scott, who was holding your hand?#
KIRK: The verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't kill her.#
KIRK: Mister Scott. Did you kill Kara?#
KIRK: Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?#
KIRK: Computer, accuracy scan.#
KIRK: After we take the testimony here, we'll run a psycho-tricorder analysis of Mister Scott's memory, which is what we wanted to do on the surface. That will give us a complete record. Will that satisfy you, Mister Hengist?#
KIRK: There will be no error. As for the rest of it, the readings will show. You can step down, Mister Scott, if there are no objections.#
KIRK: We can ask no more. Mister Morla, will you take the stand?#
KIRK: Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered?#
KIRK: Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?#
KIRK: Did you kill Sybo?#
KIRK: Computer, verification scan.#
KIRK: All right, Mister Morla, I think you can step down now. Sybo spoke of a hunger that never dies. Something that thrives on fear, terror, death. Mister Spock, maybe we're going about it in the wrong way. Let's assume that Sybo was a sensitive. That she did sense something, something evil.#
KIRK: All right, then, what was it she said, exactly? A monstrous evil, ancient terror.#
KIRK: She said something else, words that didn't make sense.#
KIRK: Obscure, meaningless words.#
KIRK: Ah. Mister Spock, check them out.#
KIRK: Jack the Ripper?#
KIRK: Yes, all men die. And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he were a man. But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper, which is an impossibility, isn't it? Or is it?#
KIRK: We know that someone or something killed three women. If it's impossible for it to be human, it has to be something else. Something driven to kill.#
KIRK: No, Mister Hengist, not ghosts. Possibly not human, but not ghosts. Mister Spock, check out the possibilities.#
KIRK: Computer, could the described entity assume physical form?#
KIRK: No, I've seen the mellitus myself. In its natural state, it's gaseous. When it's at rest, it's solid. Mister Spock, let's assume the existence of this creature.#
KIRK: Doesn't seem likely, does it?#
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock, what do we have? A creature without form, that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape to kill.#
KIRK: Computer. Criminological files. Cases of unsolved mass murders of women since Jack the Ripper.#
KIRK: Yes. When man moved out into the galaxy, that thing must've moved with him. Computer, identify the proper names Kesla and Beratis.#
KIRK: You come from Rigel Four.#
KIRK: No, but what we're investigating is. Would you mind taking the stand, Mister Hengist?#
KIRK: And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered.#
KIRK: Perhaps. Mister Spock. The murder weapon.#
KIRK: Now then, Mister Hengist (But Hengist tries to make a break for it, even landing a very good kick on Kirk, who repays him with an even better right cross. Hengist falls to the floor.)#
KIRK: But that's impossible.#
KIRK: And the computer controls the ship.#
KIRK: Audio cut off, Spock.#
KIRK: It means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship, including the life support systems.#
KIRK: All hands, this is the captain. Stay at your posts. Remain calm. Captain out. Bones. What's the sedative situation?#
KIRK: Good. Start distribution immediately. The longer we can hold back that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the computer. Prefect, you'll all be safer here. Spock, come with me.#
KIRK: Spock, don't you have a compulsory scan unit built into the computer banks?#
KIRK: Aren't there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved?#
KIRK: That ought to do it.#
KIRK: Spock!#
KIRK: Too quickly. Bridge.#
KIRK: Out of control. Put it on manual. Bridge.#
KIRK: That was due to be next. Life-support malfunction.#
KIRK: You said it yourself, Spock. It wants terror, not just death.#
KIRK: All right. Man your station, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Cut that thing off.#
KIRK: Try and cut that thing off.#
KIRK: Man your post, Mister Sulu.  Prepare your manual overrides. You may need them.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: That should be enough time. Let's get at it.#
KIRK: Never mind, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Tranquilliser?#
KIRK: Everyone, including yourself.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Yes, I know.#
KIRK: If you destroy this ship, you destroy yourself.#
KIRK: Man your post, Mister. If any of the other systems go out, switch to manual override, and above all, don't be afraid.#
KIRK: Implement.#
KIRK: Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while. The Argelians will be the first to panic. Let's get back to the briefing room.#
KIRK: I doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for a while.#
KIRK: How are you doing?#
KIRK: Yes, but where to? Bones, what would happen if that thing entered a tranquillised body?#
KIRK: You say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris?#
KIRK: Well, I'm willing to take a chance on Mister Spock. Better give yourself a shot, Doc.#
KIRK: Do as I say.#
KIRK: Extend your arm, Mister Jaris.#
KIRK: Let's get him to the Transporter Room, quick!#
KIRK: Deep space. Full power. Widest angle of dispersion. Maintain.#
KIRK: You do it, Spock.#
KIRK: No. We beamed it out into open space, Scotty. Widest possible dispersion.#
KIRK: But it will die finally. You seem very happy about the whole thing.#
KIRK: Bones, how long will it take for this tranquilliser to wear off?#
KIRK: Yes, I can see that. Well Mister Spock, for the next five or six hours, we're going to have the happiest crew in space. Of course, we won't get much work done.#
KIRK: That's a splendid idea, Mister Spock. I know a cafe where the women are so#
KIRK: You, gentlemen? In your condition? Don't be ridiculous. Mister Spock, this cafe has women that are so.  No, I guess not. Alone?#
KIRK: Gentlemen.#
KIRK: What about the Federation science team working there? Doctor Manway had a special transmitter.#
KIRK: They have to answer.#
KIRK: That can't be. The last census reported a total inhabitation of more than four billion people.#
KIRK: That's impossible. What could have happened?#
KIRK: Any other possibilities?#
KIRK: Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Full power to the shields, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: All hands, Red Alert. Phaser banks stand by. Photon torpedoes to Condition Red, Condition Red.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: Ninety?#
KIRK: I think we can expect others, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, pinpoint the source. Mister Sulu, evasive manoeuvres.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Patch in my log. Tell them what has happened. Tell them the entire Malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an unidentified force.#
KIRK: Helmsmen, I said evasive manoeuvres.#
KIRK: Scotty?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, speed of those bolts.#
KIRK: Then we can't out run them. Good, Scotty. You're doing the right thing.  Source, Spock.#
KIRK: That's our target, Mister Sulu. Prepare photon torpedo.#
KIRK: Has the target changed location, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Ready photon torpedo number two, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Fire.#
KIRK: Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock .#
KIRK: But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived? Lieutenant, try to make contact.#
KIRK: Can we take it, Mister Scott?#
KIRK: Anything, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Translator computer. All hailing frequencies open.#
KIRK: To unidentified vessel. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or any lifeforms. Please communicate with us. Any further readings, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Five hundred kilos and only one metre long?#
KIRK: Put it on audio, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Analysis sector. Have them study and decode it.#
KIRK: Can you decode it?#
KIRK: Repeat what? The message I sent?#
KIRK: This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy. We have no hostile intentions. We request identity.#
KIRK: Tie in the ship's translator to the communication channel. Let them take it at their own speed.#
KIRK: I guess they can take it faster than we give it.#
KIRK: Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out.#
KIRK: It is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size differential.#
KIRK: We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship.#
KIRK: Do you require any special conditions, any particular atmosphere or environment?#
KIRK: Good. Hold your position. We're locked onto your co-ordinates. We'll beam you aboard.#
KIRK: Do we have any choice, Scotty? Besides, once it's aboard, it won't be taking any more shots at us. Lieutenant, get a repair crew on that computer. Get Doctor McCoy down to the transporter room. Spock, you come with me. Scotty, you too.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Sensor readings, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: We are from the United Federation of Planets.#
KIRK: If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of reference. It won't know more than it does now.#
KIRK: If you care to leave your ship, we'll provide the necessary life support systems.#
KIRK: Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s?#
KIRK: I will bring them.#
KIRK: This way.#
KIRK: Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity.#
KIRK: Spock, Bones, come with us.#
KIRK: 14A.  Nomad, can you scan that?#
KIRK: This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: What sterilisation procedure?#
KIRK: Yes, he is.#
KIRK: Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless.#
KIRK: Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out for that.#
KIRK: Did you destroy the Malurian system?#
KIRK: Doctor. Why do you call me the creator?#
KIRK: Well, I#
KIRK: Mister Singh. Come here a moment. This unit will see to your needs.#
KIRK: I'll be back in a moment. Gentlemen, come with me.#
KIRK: You're on to something, Spock. What is it?#
KIRK: Nomad was destroyed.#
KIRK: I heard some lectures at the Academy on the Nomad probe. Its mission was essentially peaceful.#
KIRK: Jackson Roykirk. Captain James Kirk.#
KIRK: What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock?#
KIRK: Its purpose was certainly altered. Its directive, to seek out and destroy biological infestations, could not have been programmed into it.#
KIRK: If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a device which sooner or later must destroy us. Security.#
KIRK: This is the captain. The mechanism we brought aboard is in the auxiliary control room. Have a security team meet me there in five minutes.#
KIRK: Security, cancel that order. Implement a full search for the mechanism. All decks report to me here.#
KIRK: On my way, Scotty.#
KIRK: Scotty!#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: Why did you kill him?#
KIRK: That unit was my Chief Engineer.  Lieutenant. Lieutenant, are you all right?#
KIRK: Sickbay. What did you do to her?#
KIRK: Get Scott down below.#
KIRK: He's dead.#
KIRK: His biological functions have ceased.#
KIRK: All right, Nomad. Repair the unit.#
KIRK: It serves me as it is, Nomad. Repair it.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy will show you.#
KIRK: Security. I want a twenty four hour, two man armed surveillance on Nomad. Pick it up in Sickbay.#
KIRK: It's all right.#
KIRK: Scotty, she's being taken care of. It's all right.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy will explain it to you.#
KIRK: Nomad, come here. (They all go to the doorway to the medical bay. Uhura is in bed, still staring blankly) KIRK: Repair that unit.#
KIRK: You restored Scott. He had much more extensive damage.#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: Yes. Nomad, you will go with these units. They will take you to a waiting area. Take it to the top security cell.#
KIRK: It's a killer, Spock. I intend to render it harmless. Get down to the Brig. Run a full analysis on the mechanism. I want to know what makes that thing tick. SPOCK; Yes, sir.#
KIRK: What's the problem?#
KIRK: Nomad, you will allow Mister Spock to probe your memory banks and structure.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Follow your instructions, Nomad.#
KIRK: We've got to know about it, Spock. what makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection.#
KIRK: Get into direct mental contact with that thing?#
KIRK: You saw what it did to Uhura.#
KIRK: Nomad, the unit Spock will touch you. It is not an attack. It is a form of communication. You will permit it.#
KIRK: Spock. Spock! Nomad! You're in contact with the unit Spock. Stop! Stop!#
KIRK: Spock. Spock?#
KIRK: What does it mean, we are Nomad?#
KIRK: Then it isn't Nomad?#
KIRK: A changeling.#
KIRK: An ancient Earth legend, Mister Spock. A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed the identity of the human child. So, it is to sterilise, and for sterilise read kill. SPOCK And it has the power and sophistication to do it. KIRK: Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible. It's space-happy. It thinks I'm its mother.#
KIRK: Nomad, stop what you're doing. Scotty?#
KIRK: You will destroy my ship. Its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power. Turn off your repair operation.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there.#
KIRK: You killed two of my#
KIRK: Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are! I'm a biological unit, and I created you.#
KIRK: Nomad, there are two men waiting outside. You will not harm them. They will escort you back to the waiting area. You will stay there. You will do nothing.#
KIRK: I have given you new programming and you will implement it.#
KIRK: Reevaluate?#
KIRK: It was a foolish mistake.#
KIRK: Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when it tapped the computers earlier?#
KIRK: And we've shown it the way home. And when it gets there#
KIRK: And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise. Captain's log, stardate 3541.9. The presence of Nomad aboard my ship has become nightmarish. Now it apparently means to return to Earth. Once there, it would automatically destroy all life.#
KIRK: Manual controls.#
KIRK: Nomad. Nomad? Stop. Nomad, stop! Nomad.#
KIRK: Is she all right?#
KIRK: What happened?#
KIRK: Whose history?#
KIRK: And found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other biological units.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Nomad.#
KIRK: Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering.#
KIRK: Nomad? Stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems.#
KIRK: You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator.#
KIRK: Nomad, I admit that biological units are imperfect, but a biological unit created you.#
KIRK: No, you're not Nomad. You're an alien machine. Your programming tapes have been altered.#
KIRK: But I am your creator.#
KIRK: I created you?#
KIRK: But I admit I'm imperfect. How could I have created such a perfect thing as you?#
KIRK: Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect?#
KIRK: You must sterilise in case of error?#
KIRK: Everything that is in error must be sterilised.#
KIRK: Nomad, I made an error in creating you.#
KIRK: I did not create perfection. I created error.#
KIRK: I am the Kirk, the creator?#
KIRK: You are wrong! Jackson Roykirk, your creator, is dead. You have mistaken me for him. You are in error. You did not discover your mistake. You have made two errors. You are flawed and imperfect and you have not corrected by sterilisation. You have made three errors.#
KIRK: You are flawed and imperfect! Execute your prime function!#
KIRK: Now. Get those antigravs on it.#
KIRK: We've got to get rid of it while it's trying to think.#
KIRK: Scotty, the transporter room.#
KIRK: Scotty, set the controls for deep space. Two ten, mark one.#
KIRK: Nomad, you are imperfect!#
KIRK: Exercise your prime function.#
KIRK: Now!#
KIRK: You didn't think I had it in me, did you Spock?#
KIRK: Good, Bones, good.#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives. It's well gone. Besides, what are you feeling so badly about? It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son.#
KIRK: Well, it thought I was its mother, didn't it? Do you think I'm completely without feelings, Mister Spock? You saw what it did for Scotty. What a doctor it would've made. My son, the doctor. Kind of gets you right there, doesn't it?#
KIRK: Start your readings.#
KIRK: It is spectacular, isn't it?#
KIRK: Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor readings. Starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted. We do what we're told.#
KIRK: Are you sure about that?#
KIRK: I know. Almost impossible.#
KIRK: Just outside Moscow. All right. There's a village about seventeen kilometres away on bearing two three two. We'll head that way.#
KIRK: What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this? Captain's log, stardate 3715.3. While making a routine exploration of the unexplored Gamma Trianguli Six, one of my men has been killed by a poisonous plant.#
KIRK: As soon as we get out of the way, beam the body up.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: What's causing it?#
KIRK: But you say there's nothing to worry about?#
KIRK: Well, stay on top of it. We've got a job to down here. We might as well finish it.#
KIRK: Yeah, it's nice. If we're a little more careful, we shouldn't run into any more trouble.#
KIRK: We'll do the walking, Scotty. You get on the antimatter pod. If it gets worse, let me know, we'll beam up. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Scotty will handle it. We've got a job to do. Turn up anything on your tricorder?#
KIRK: That's strange.#
KIRK: Mallory.#
KIRK: We're heading for the village. Avoid contact with the humanoids. I want you and Marple to make a full reconnaissance. And be careful. There may be other dangers besides poisonous plants. Keep in constant communication.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, Yeoman Landon. I know you find each other fascinating, but we're not here to conduct a field experiment in human biology.#
KIRK: Whatever it is, it moves like a cat.#
KIRK: Neither do I. All hands. We've been watched, we'll probably be watched. We're moving out. Formation L. (They set off in single file, a guard in the lead and Chekov bringing up the rear.)#
KIRK: Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Garden of Eden, with land mines. (Spock puts the other piece of rock down very carefully, and they continue their route march. An occasional bush rustle indicates they are being watched.)#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: We're heading there now, Scotty. You need any help?#
KIRK: All right, Scotty. We'll try and find out what's going on down here. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Some kind of generator?#
KIRK: What's that?#
KIRK: Peculiar stuff to find in paradise.#
KIRK: Spock! Spock! Security alert. Is he alive?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: We're beaming up. Notify transporter room. And make arrangements to pick up Mallory and Marple. They're scouting ahead of us.#
KIRK: All hands.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Scotty, energise. Scotty, what's the matter?#
KIRK: Scotty, is the transporter malfunction tied in with trouble you're having with the antimatter pods?#
KIRK: Spock. Are you all right?#
KIRK: Just what do you think you were trying to do?#
KIRK: Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself.#
KIRK: I see. Well next time, just yell. I can step out of the way as quickly as the next man.#
KIRK: Trying to get yourself killed. Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you?#
KIRK: Never mind. But thanks. Kaplan, take the post.#
KIRK: Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well.#
KIRK: Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky.#
KIRK: Come on! (They take cover, and the storm passes as quickly as it came. They find the smoldering remains of Kaplan.) KIRK: Phasers. A beautiful day, Mister Spock. Not a cloud in the sky. Just like paradise. (The scouting party has reached a collection of round huts - very African.) KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Come in!#
KIRK: Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Mallory!#
KIRK: On the double.#
KIRK: Mallory! Marple, stand back! Watch it! The rocks! (kneeling by the body) Kaplan. Hendorff. I know Kaplan's family. Now Mallory.#
KIRK: His father helped me get into the Academy.#
KIRK: I could've prevented all of it.#
KIRK: A walk in paradise, among the green grass and flowers. We should've beamed up at the first sign of trouble.#
KIRK: I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider them overly hazardous. This isn't that important a mission, Spock. Not worth the lives of three of my men. I drop my guard for a minute because I like the smell of growing things, and now three men are dead. And the ship's in trouble.#
KIRK: Marple, Chekov, at attention. Gentlemen, something or someone is behind that rock. I want it. Marple, cut around the rock to your right. Make a loud noise. Be careful.  Spock, you and Chekov create a diversion and make it loud.#
KIRK: I won't hurt you. Do you understand? I won't hurt you.#
KIRK: Well, I won't strike you again. You've been following us, watching us. Why?#
KIRK: Who is Vaal?#
KIRK: Do you have a name?#
KIRK: They're not going to hurt you. I promise you. Akuta, Akuta, we come in peace. We would like to speak to this Vaal.#
KIRK: Antennae?#
KIRK: You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Scotty, are the warp drives still out?#
KIRK: Put it on maximum. Full emergency circuits.#
KIRK: Maintain full reverse thrust against the pull. Put a team on that warp drive. Get it working.#
KIRK: Scotty, you're my Chief Engineer. You know everything about that ship there is to know. More than the men who designed it. If you can't get those warp engines working#
KIRK: Tell me about Vaal.#
KIRK: Take me to him. I wish to speak to him.#
KIRK: I'll take my chances.#
KIRK: But this is not the centre, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: A force field?#
KIRK: You all right?#
KIRK: Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal?#
KIRK: Well, we can't get to it. We can't talk to it unless it wants to talk to us.#
KIRK: When does he get hungry?#
KIRK: Where are the others?#
KIRK: The children.#
KIRK: Little ones like yourselves. They grow.#
KIRK: Well, thank you. It does something for you.#
KIRK: Nothing makes sense down here. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Status report, Scotty.#
KIRK: I'm sick of hearing that word can't. Get that ship out of there.#
KIRK: Then use your imagination. Tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines. Discard the warp drive nacelles if you have to, and crack out of there with the main section, but get that ship out of there!#
KIRK: Do it. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: I see. Opinion.#
KIRK: Add to that a simple diet, a perfectly controlled temperature, no natural enemies, apparently no vices, no replacements needed. Maybe it is paradise after all. (A gong sounds outside, and all the villagers are heading off towards Vaal.)#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Well, the field's down, people are going in. Let's see what kind of luck we have. (But as soon as they stand, the eyes light up and there is a rumble of thunder.) KIRK: That's not the way.#
KIRK: But it needs to eat. Frequently. So it can't have any great power reserves.#
KIRK: What happens if Vaal weakens around feeding time? Spock, check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab. Get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship. Have them measure it hour by hour.#
KIRK: Mess call.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I think this philosophical argument can wait until our ship's out of danger. Kirk here.#
KIRK: Did it maintain, Scotty?#
KIRK: Good. Keep monitoring. How are you coming along with the circuit switchover?#
KIRK: That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty.#
KIRK: Kirk out.#
KIRK: Yeoman, you're wasting energy.#
KIRK: Sit down, and have something to eat.#
KIRK: That hasn't happened yet. I wonder what would happen? Yeoman, speculate. What would happen if someone on this planet died?#
KIRK: Accidents happen.#
KIRK: They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Mister Spock? You're the science officer. Why don't you explain it to the young lady.#
KIRK: Bones was right. These people aren't living, they're existing. They don't create, they don't produce, they don't even think. They exist to service a machine.#
KIRK: These are people, not robots. They should have the opportunity of choice. We owe it to them to interfere.#
KIRK: I'll take my chances. Why don't you have a look around? Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott?#
KIRK: How's it going, Scotty?#
KIRK: You realise that within forty five minutes, the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere?#
KIRK: Yes, I#
KIRK: Kirk out. What is it?#
KIRK: Vaal, we are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or your people.#
KIRK: Let's get out of here!#
KIRK: Bones!#
KIRK: Marple! (The red-shirt is struck by Akuta. The other men are easily eluded, disarmed and dealt with.) KIRK: Put them in the hut. Find out where the women are. Put them in there, too.#
KIRK: All right, Scotty, put her in full reverse. Get her out of there.#
KIRK: Scotty, what happened?#
KIRK: You're fired. Four hundred people#
KIRK: They'll die because I couldn't see a warning sign. I had to follow orders, always orders.#
KIRK: Bones, that's it. Stay with Chekov. Keep those people from feeding Vaal. Don't let them feed Vaal. Keep them in the hut. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Scotty, do you still have phaser power?#
KIRK: If my guess is correct, they won't have to. Stand by.#
KIRK: Tapping its energy cells.#
KIRK: Good. The ship's pulling away must have weakened it considerable. It has to be fed, but its reserve capacity could hold out for days.#
KIRK: My plan exactly. Scotty.#
KIRK: Scotty, commence firing and maintain.#
KIRK: Good. Let's see how long he can do it. (The green glow arrives at the snake's head as the storm clouds gather. The lightning flashes, and small explosions go off inside Vaal. Smoke comes out of its mouth. Finally, the eyes stop glowing and the throat goes dark.) KIRK: Scotty, cease fire.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, status report.#
KIRK: Scotty, you're re-hired. As soon as the transporter's fixed, form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down. Kirk out. Chekov, Bones. Let those people go.#
KIRK: You'll learn to care for yourselves, with our help. And there's no trick to putting fruit on trees. You might enjoy it. You'll learn to build for yourselves, think for yourselves, work for yourselves, and what you create is yours. That's what we call freedom. You'll like it, a lot. And you'll learn something about men and women, the way they're supposed to be. Caring for each other, being happy with each other, being good to each other. That's what we call love. You'll like that, too, a lot. You and your children.#
KIRK: The little ones? Look like you? Just go on the way you're going. You'll find out.#
KIRK: Well, that's a good object lesson, Mister Spock. It's an example of what can happen when a machine becomes too efficient, does too much work for you.#
KIRK: Yes, of course I'm aware of it. Adam and Eve tasted the apple and as a result were driven out of paradise.#
KIRK: Doctor, do I understand him correctly? Are you casting me in the role of Satan?#
KIRK: Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan? (McCoy and Kirk walk around Spock. McCoy is gazing intently at his ears.)#
KIRK: No, Mister Spock. I didn't think you would be.#
KIRK: We have shown the council historical proof that our missions are peaceful.#
KIRK: I admire your ethics and hope to prove ours. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Report on magnetic storm, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Rough ride?#
KIRK: Stand by to beam up landing party.#
KIRK: When may we resume discussion?#
KIRK: But we won't. Consider that. Enterprise. Transporter room, energise.#
KIRK: Spock was right. It was a rough trip. (Spock and Kyle greet their Captain with a semi-Nazi salute. Their uniforms have changes, and Spock has grown a very fetching goatee beard.)#
KIRK: No change.#
KIRK: None.#
KIRK: Yes. Doctor McCoy, you'd better look us over. That was a rough beam-up.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, have those transporter circuits checked.#
KIRK: Not now. Not now.#
KIRK: I don't know. It's our Enterprise but it isn't. Maybe#
KIRK: Any of you feel dizzy when we were in the transporter beam?#
KIRK: When we first materialised.#
KIRK: It happened twice. First we were in our own transporter chamber, then we faded, and then when we finally materialised, we were here. Wherever this is.#
KIRK: Yes, here. Not our universe, not our ship. Something parallel. A parallel universe co-existing with ours on another dimensional plane. Everything's duplicated, almost. Another Enterprise. Spock with a beard.#
KIRK: Then our counterparts must have been transporting up at the exact same time. Similar storms on both universes disrupted the circuits. We're here, and they're on our Enterprise. Probably asking the same questions. Are we in another universe, and if so, how do we get back to our own? They'll use the computer, and we have to.#
KIRK: Scotty, can you buy me some time. Get below and short out the main phaser couplings. They'll think the storm blew the stand-by circuits.#
KIRK: Then get on this technology. It's all we have to work with if we want to get back home. The intercom may be monitored. Use your communicators for private messages. Subfrequency and scramble.#
KIRK: Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Get to your post. Run today's communication from Starfleet Command. I want to know my exact orders and options, if any.#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: Uhura, you're the only one who can do it. I'll be right there.#
KIRK: Bones. Let's take a look at the library. We have a lot to learn.#
KIRK: Communications status.#
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Very good. Thank you, Mister Scott. Kirk out.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, contact the Halkan council. I wish to talk to them again.#
KIRK: This is a new race. They offer other things of value besides dilithium crystals.#
KIRK: Put phasers on standby, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: I have my reasons, and I'll make them clear to you in my own good time.#
KIRK: It is useless to resist us.#
KIRK: You have twelve hours to consider your position.#
KIRK: We will level your planet and take what we want. That is destruction. You will die as a race.#
KIRK: We will not argue. Twelve hours. No more. Close communications. Turn phasers off.#
KIRK: I shall be in my quarters. Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy and Mister Scott meet me there. (Chekov presses a couple of buttons on his console, then leaves his post.)#
KIRK: You're at liberty to do so, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Yes, he did your job.#
KIRK: Get him out of here.#
KIRK: All right. You're working for me.#
KIRK: You're in line. You might even make captain.#
KIRK: Not on my ship.#
KIRK: Yes, the booth. Carry on.#
KIRK: It's called blood. Watch your step. The officers move up by assassination. Chekov tried it on me.#
KIRK: Report on technology.#
KIRK: Star readings?#
KIRK: Let's find out where we stand. Computer.#
KIRK: This is the Captain. Record security research, to be classified under my voice print or Mister Scott's.#
KIRK: Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm. Correlate following hypothesis. Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power surge in the transporter circuits creating a momentary interdimensional contact with a parallel universe?#
KIRK: At such a moment, could persons in each universe, in the act of beaming, transpose with their counterparts in the other universe?#
KIRK: Could conditions necessary to such an event be created artificially using the ship's power?#
KIRK: Record procedure. Scotty, can you do it?#
KIRK: Let's find out. Computer.#
KIRK: Read out official record of current command.#
KIRK: Cancel. Now we know.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to distract Sulu, at your signal. Let's get back to our posts. Keep me advised.#
KIRK: On our Enterprise.#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: Logical, as always, Mister Spock. (They arrive at a cylinder containing Chekov, who is writhing in agony.)#
KIRK: I haven't decided.#
KIRK: I said I haven't decided.#
KIRK: You heard my orders.#
KIRK: Is that a threat?#
KIRK: Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans?#
KIRK: Conquest is easy, control is not. We may have bitten off more than we can chew.#
KIRK: Is my concern, not yours. You would find me a formidable enemy.#
KIRK: Release Chekov. Confine him to quarters.#
KIRK: He gambled, I won.#
KIRK: I was preoccupied. .#
KIRK: Further than that, if I'm successful.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: And if I don't?#
KIRK: I don't intend to kill him.#
KIRK: No, but I'll avoid killing Spock.#
KIRK: I'll get out of his way.#
KIRK: Yes. (She touches a wall panel and it rises to reveal a screen and a collection of buttons.)#
KIRK: It's not that bad.#
KIRK: Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities#
KIRK: I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear him.#
KIRK: How does Marlena want to fit in?#
KIRK: Scotty.#
KIRK: We have to get out of here within three hours. Spock has orders to kill me unless I complete the mission.#
KIRK: How fast?#
KIRK: If we miss?#
KIRK: All right. I'll be in the transporter room in ten minutes. I'll meet you in Sickbay afterward.#
KIRK: I've never seen perfection, but no woman could come closer to it.#
KIRK: I still do.#
KIRK: I've got to go.#
KIRK: You don't have to do that.#
KIRK: You could.  I simply meant that you could be anything you want to be.#
KIRK: You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not. (She turns on the Tantalus machine and watches him go into a turbolift.)#
KIRK: Uhura?;#
KIRK: Scotty's signal should be coming through any moment. You know what to do.#
KIRK: Keep Sulu's attention off that board.#
KIRK: Good luck. Kirk out.#
KIRK: What are you doing? Are you going to shoot me now, Spock? I thought I had until dawn.#
KIRK: Shoot. You're wasting time.#
KIRK: You're running a big risk, Spock.#
KIRK: How much time, Scotty?#
KIRK: Everything laid in, Scotty? The time lag so the operator can get into the transporter chamber?#
KIRK: He is very much like our own Mister Spock, isn't he? You've got that minute.#
KIRK: What is this, Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Let's go, Bones.#
KIRK: No longer.#
KIRK: A friend. Activate the transporter. You saved us back at Sickbay with the Tantalus field.#
KIRK: I can't. I'm sorry. Our power is balanced for four. There's no guarantee that we'll make it with five. All could die. Scotty?#
KIRK: One is coming. I'd help you if I could, Marlena. Believe that.#
KIRK: If you kill us, you'll still stay.#
KIRK: Where's McCoy? Time, Scotty.#
KIRK: Auxiliary.#
KIRK: Can you bridge to your setup?#
KIRK: One of us will have to stay.#
KIRK: Get to the transporter chamber. You, too, Uhura.#
KIRK: That's an order, Scotty.#
KIRK: McCoy.#
KIRK: You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: In that time I have something to say. How long before the Halkan prediction of galactic revolt is realised?#
KIRK: The inevitable outcome?#
KIRK: The illogic of waste, Mister Spock. The waste of lives, potential, resources, time. I submit to you that your Empire is illogical because it cannot endure. I submit that you are illogical to be a willing part of it.#
KIRK: If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic demand that you be a part of it?#
KIRK: But one man can change the present. Be the captain of this Enterprise, Mister Spock. Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans and make it stick. Push till it gives. You can defend yourself better than any man in the fleet.#
KIRK: What about it, Spock?#
KIRK: In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible.#
KIRK: What will it be? Past or future? Tyranny or freedom? It's up to you.#
KIRK: In every revolution, there's one man with a vision.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: What I don't understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly?#
KIRK: Probably. However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I read my Spocks correctly.#
KIRK: What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that other universe. I always thought Spock was a bit of a pirate at heart.#
KIRK: I'm not sure, but I think we've been insulted.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, er, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: All right, Lieutenant. Carry on.#
KIRK: Uh, why do you ask?#
KIRK: Oh, no. No, no. We haven't met before, exactly. She just seemed a nice, likable girl. I think we could become friends. It's possible. (And to prove it, he leaves his chair and goes over to stand next to her.)#
KIRK: Where is everyone?#
KIRK: I had a subspace contact with a Robert Johnson, the leader of this expedition, an hour ago.#
KIRK: No, yet there was something wrong. I can't pin it down. His conversation was disjointed, his thoughts a little foggy, unrelated. Chekov, check that building. Mister Spock and I will check this one. The rest of you, take a look around. See if you can find anyone. (Chekov goes into the dark building - it has no windows - and the light comes on as he bumps up against a table bearing the body of a very old man. He panics and runs out again.)#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk of#
KIRK: I say I'm Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Who are you?#
KIRK: How old are you? How old are you?#
KIRK: Mister Johnson, can you hear me?#
KIRK: Can you tell me what happened?#
KIRK: Did your instruments show anything?#
KIRK:  If they seem lucid, I'll be in the briefing room.#
KIRK: Stay seated. Commodore Stocker, I've asked you to be part of this briefing because Gamma Hydra Four falls in your administrative area.#
KIRK: Doctor Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you working very closely Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, would you fill them in?#
KIRK: What about the atmosphere and environment, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the Romulan empire. It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs.#
KIRK: Good. I want you all to check out everything in your own departments. No matter how remote, how far-fetched the notion, I want it run down. We'll stay in orbit until we have the answer.#
KIRK: Yes, Commodore. We'll do everything we can to make sure you make your duty.#
KIRK: Doctor, is there something I can do for you?#
KIRK: How long has it been?#
KIRK: Well, it's been a long time. Things wouldn't change if it started all over again, would it? You have your job, I have my ship, and neither one of us will change.#
KIRK: Well, I supposed that you met someone you loved.#
KIRK: And in your field as you. You didn't give up a thing.#
KIRK: I'm on my way.#
KIRK: Maintain.#
KIRK: What about the comet that astrophysics reported?#
KIRK: Yes, Commodore.#
KIRK: Thank you. You're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few facilities of our own here. I think the Enterprise will do quite nicely. I'll be in engineering, Mister Spock. Maintain standard orbit, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Oh? Well, follow it.#
KIRK: Progress report, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Astronomical section reports that a comet recently passed by. Check into that.#
KIRK: Oh, yes. Let me know what you come up with. I'll be in the Sickbay.#
KIRK: You did what you could.#
KIRK: Bones, I believe you're getting grey.#
KIRK: I see what you mean.#
KIRK: Shoulder. Just a twinge. Probably muscular strain.#
KIRK: All right. Reprimand received. Go ahead. (McCoy scans his arm, then takes hold of a finger. Kirk pulls back in pain.)#
KIRK: Why? Just muscular strain, isn't it?#
KIRK: That's impossible.#
KIRK: Scotty! Captain's log, stardate 3579.4. The Enterprise personnel who beamed down to the planet's surface, Doctor McCoy, Engineer Scott, Mister Spock, Lieutenant Galway, and myself are all showing definite signs of aging. Only Ensign Chekov appears to be normal.#
KIRK: Report, Bones.#
KIRK: Spock, could I ask for some figures?#
KIRK: Total senility?#
KIRK: What a way to die. All right. I want all the research facilities, all the scientific technicians, to start round-the-clock research immediately. I want the answers, and I want the remedy. Let's start by finding out why Chekov hasn't been affected.#
KIRK: You feel up to it?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Galway, assume your position. Start your duties.#
KIRK: She's ten years younger than I am, and she looks,#
KIRK: Why hasn't he aged?#
KIRK: Well I want to know! Is it his youth, his blood type, his heritage, his glands, his genes?#
KIRK: I'll be on the Bridge. Keep me posted as to Chekov.#
KIRK: I thought you were on your way to the biochemistry lab, Doctor.#
KIRK: So we do.#
KIRK: You sound like my first officer.#
KIRK: That didn't spring from logic.#
KIRK: When did you realise that? Today?#
KIRK: How much older was your husband than you?#
KIRK: Answer me.#
KIRK: That's quite a difference.#
KIRK: Look at me. Look at me. What do you see?#
KIRK: And old. And rapidly growing older.#
KIRK: What are you offering me, Jan? Love, or a going away present?#
KIRK: Increase orbit to twenty thousand perigee, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Yeoman.  You have a reason for being on the Bridge, Commodore Stocker?#
KIRK: I have very little time.#
KIRK: We're going to be late. I don't intend to leave this area until we've found the solution for this problem.#
KIRK: Yes, yes. If you're so concerned, I'll send a message to Starbase Ten.#
KIRK: Yeoman? Where's that#
KIRK: Fuel consumption report?#
KIRK: If I'd signed it, I wouldn't have asked for it, now would l?#
KIRK: Mister Spock. I was just thinking.#
KIRK: You have something to report?#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Good, Spock. Well done. Let's get this to Doctor McCoy immediately. Oh. Lieutenant, take a message to Starfleet Command. Due to the proximity of the Romulans, you'd better use Code two.#
KIRK: Then use Code three.#
KIRK: Message. Key to affliction may be comet which passed by Gamma Hydra Four. Said comet is now,#
KIRK: Quadrant. All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of radiation and means found to neutralise it. Comet is highly dangerous. Kirk, commanding Enterprise. Immediately, Lieutenant. Let's go.#
KIRK: Oh, Mister Sulu. Increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee.#
KIRK: I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being questioned. Now do as you're told, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Maintain.#
KIRK: All right, Bones, I'm going up to the Bridge. Keep me posted. Spock?#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: How long have we got, Bones?#
KIRK: Let it also read that I consider it invalid.#
KIRK: Yes, I would like to make a statement. I am the captain of this ship and am totally capable of commanding her. Let's call this whole thing off and get back to work.#
KIRK: Very kind of you, Spock.#
KIRK: He did not. When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. I don't have to repeat myself.#
KIRK: No, I'm thirty four. I'm thirty four years old.#
KIRK: I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: No, no, no. It's all right, Spock. It's all right. There's only one reason, and one reason alone, for having this, hearing. I refused to leave Gamma Hydra Two#
KIRK: Yes. A slip of the tongue.#
KIRK: So I'm a little confused. Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill. And this nonsense about a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man. Trying to relieve a captain of his command is, well, that's, that's. Spock, I wouldn't have believed it of you. Go ahead. Ask me questions. I'll show you what I'm capable of. There's nothing wrong with my memory. Go ahead! Ask me anything! We're in orbit around Gamma Hydra Two, right? Anyhow, it doesn't matter. There's a lot more to running a starship than answering a lot of fool questions. A lot more. Go ahead. Ask me questions.#
KIRK: Ask me anything. Anything.#
KIRK: Good idea. Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to running the ship. The most fool thing I ever heard of. Competency hearing when there's work to be done. I'll be in my quarters, awaiting your decision.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: So, I've been relieved.#
KIRK: Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney.#
KIRK: Regulations. Don't give me regulations. You've wanted command all along. First little excuse you get#
KIRK: I hope you're proud of. What do you mean, you've not assumed command?#
KIRK: If you're not in command, who is?#
KIRK: Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command.#
KIRK: No! Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound paper-pusher. I order you to take command.#
KIRK: Are you refusing a direct order?#
KIRK: You traitorous, disloyal, you stab me in the back the first chance you get? Spock. Get out. I never want to have to look at you again.#
KIRK: Jan, Jan.#
KIRK: I made a fool of myself in there. I shouldn't have let them confuse me, rattle me.#
KIRK: But I'm not old, Jan. I'm not. A few muscular aches doesn't make a man old. And you don't run a starship with your arms. You run it with your head. My brain's as sharp as it ever was. A simple case of radiation poisoning, and they relieve me of my command. I admit I'm getting a little grey, but radiation will do that to you.#
KIRK: Jan, you know me. Look at me closely. Tell me. Am I getting old?#
KIRK: What are you doing here?#
KIRK: Maybe you'd like to relieve Doctor McCoy. What about Chekov?#
KIRK: Bones, there has to be. There has to be. We beamed down together. We were on the surface together. The same spot. We were together all the time.#
KIRK: He left us? He left us. He went into the building. Spock, something happened.#
KIRK: He was scared! He saw the dead body and he ran out of the building and he was scared to death.#
KIRK: I'm going up to the bridge.#
KIRK: I have to go to the bridge. We're under attack.#
KIRK: Let me go.#
KIRK: We're under attack. I have to go to the Bridge. I've got to go to the bridge.#
KIRK: Greenhorn, up there ruining my ship.#
KIRK: No. No. My ship. My ship.#
KIRK: No. I'll take the first shot.#
KIRK: How long do you think this ship can take the pounding? I've got to get up there.#
KIRK: I'll die anyway. Do it.#
KIRK: Quickly. Quickly. (She does, and he goes into convulsions. Fortunately he is already strapped down.)#
KIRK: Report, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Engineering, this is the captain. I want full emergency power. I want everything within about two minutes. I want the warp drive engines on full standby. Kirk out. Open up a special channel to Starfleet Command. Code two.#
KIRK: That's an order, Lieutenant. Code two.#
KIRK: Message. From Enterprise to Starfleet Command this sector. Have inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone. Surrounded and under heavy Romulan attack. Escape impossible, shields failing. Will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed. Since this will result in the destruction of the Enterprise and all matter in a two hundred thousand kilometre diameter and establish a corresponding dead zone, all Federation ships will avoid this area for the next four solar years. Explosion will take place in one minute. Kirk, commanding Enterprise, out. Mister Sulu, course one eight eight degrees, mark fourteen. Speed, warp factor eight. Stand by.#
KIRK: A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are they still retreating?#
KIRK: Good. All hands, stand by. Warp factor eight, now.#
KIRK: Are we out of range, Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Secure from Red Alert. Adjust a new course, two five seven degrees, mark three. Heading for Starbase Ten.#
KIRK: Noted. You should know, however, that there's very little a Starbase can do that a starship can't.#
KIRK: You're looking good, Doc.#
KIRK: And yourself?#
KIRK: Well, gentlemen, all and all, an experience we'll remember in our old age. Which won't be for some while, I hope. Take over, Mister Sulu. Steady as she goes.#
KIRK: I thought I said that.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Correct it.#
KIRK: Auxiliary control, this is the captain. Auxiliary control, what's going on down there?#
KIRK: Kirk to Security.#
KIRK: Intruder alert, deck eight, auxiliary control.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, have Mister Spock report to the bridge.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Any sign of the intruder?#
KIRK: Find him. Kirk out. Mister Spock, we seem to be taking an unscheduled ride.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, cut in emergency manual monitor. I want the override broken.#
KIRK: Emergency manual monitor, report.#
KIRK: Emergency manual monitor, this is the captain. Report.#
KIRK: Kirk to Engineering.#
KIRK: Scotty, the intruder is in your area.#
KIRK: Scotty.#
KIRK: Scotty? Security, the intruder is in the engineering section. Have all units converge on that point.#
KIRK: Cut power.#
KIRK: Spock, take over.#
KIRK: Tell Security we've found the intruder. Do you mind telling me what this is all about, mister?#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: You require? Who and what are we? (Norman lifts his tunic and opens a panel in his abdomen. There are circuit boards, wires and the obligatory flashing lights in there.) KIRK: An android.#
KIRK: Who sent you?#
KIRK: It seems we're going to take a little trip. Captain's log. Stardate 4513.3. After having been taken over by an android, the Enterprise has been under way at warp seven for four days. Now we are entering orbit around a planet which has never been charted.#
KIRK: Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise.#
KIRK: I must say that's a gracious invitation.#
KIRK: And what is that word?#
KIRK: I don't believe it.#
KIRK: Harry Mudd.#
KIRK: Ruler? Harry, I want control of my ship returned immediately. We have no intention of staying as your guests.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Oh, do I know him. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief#
KIRK: Swindler and con man#
KIRK: Liar and rogue.#
KIRK: He belongs in jail, which is where I thought I left you, Mudd.#
KIRK: Mudd, I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate the trigger mechanism and free my ship.#
KIRK: I'm telling you now.#
KIRK: All right, I'll listen. What are you telling?#
KIRK: Harry Mudd, you're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble. I want navigational control restored, my ship released.#
KIRK: All right, Harry, explain. How did you get here? We left you in custody after that affair on the Rigel mining planet.#
KIRK: Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents?#
KIRK: Who caught you?#
KIRK: Yes. Who caught you?#
KIRK: And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans.#
KIRK: That's what I would have done.#
KIRK: He broke jail.#
KIRK: He stole a spaceship.#
KIRK: They fired at him.#
KIRK: Go on, get on with it, Harry.#
KIRK: They picked a fine representative.#
KIRK: I think not, Harry.#
KIRK: Who?#
KIRK: Yes. My ship.#
KIRK: Norman, who created you?#
KIRK: What became of them?#
KIRK: Then some of your makers survive.#
KIRK: All right. We might later. In the meantime, would you mind leaving us?#
KIRK: Because we don't like you. Now.#
KIRK: Well, opinions?#
KIRK: That's a great help, Mister Chekov. Bones?#
KIRK: Spock. And if you say we're in a lot of trouble.#
KIRK: Try and find it. The rest of you, look around, learn everything you can. I'll see what else I can find out from Mister Mudd. Let's go.#
KIRK: Very impressive.#
KIRK: I must say, I like the styling.#
KIRK: Don't you believe in male androids, Harry?#
KIRK: Don't lose your head, Bones. Nobody's staying anywhere.#
KIRK: Scotty, you were ordered to stay aboard.#
KIRK: What does she mean, the last one?#
KIRK: Are you out of your mind?  You can't beam down an entire crew of a spaceship. Somebody has to be on board.#
KIRK: Harry, Harry, you'll never get away with it.#
KIRK: Starfleet.#
KIRK: I'm trying not to.#
KIRK: Yes, I know. That's what worries me. How will my crew react in a world where they can have everything they want simply by asking for it.#
KIRK: Is that the way you're going to do it, Mudd? Hit my people at their weakest point?#
KIRK: All right, here we are, birds in a gilded cage. The question is, how do we get out of here?#
KIRK: All right. We're getting back to the ship, and don't you forget it. Straighten up! This may be a gilded cage filled with everything you always wanted, but it's still a cage. We don't belong here. We belong on that ship up there.#
KIRK: No. Yes. My ship.#
KIRK: Yes, I know.#
KIRK: Alice, give us back our ship to please us. Return us to our ship because we desire it.#
KIRK: But we're unhappy here.#
KIRK: We want the Enterprise.#
KIRK: No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her.#
KIRK: Interesting.#
KIRK: Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of the androids?#
KIRK: Yes. That's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose.#
KIRK: Mudd, a few questions I want to ask you.#
KIRK: Yes. My ship.#
KIRK: Harry, I think they have something else in mind.#
KIRK: We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human. And maybe that's the word that best explains us.#
KIRK: The whole galaxy controlled by your kind?#
KIRK: So far this thing has had its amusing aspects, but that threat the androids made about taking over all the humans in the galaxy is not very funny.#
KIRK: Why shouldn't they answer our questions? They don't think we can do anything to stop them.#
KIRK: All right, what have we got to work with?#
KIRK: I agree. What in your opinion does direct them?#
KIRK: Norman. When I told one of the Alices that the Enterprise was a lovely lady and we loved her, she said, Norman, co-ordinate. Why Norman? Unless#
KIRK: Named Norman. Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind. And the glowing badges, they indicate the mind in operation.#
KIRK: Yes, logical. That's what it is. And that in turn gives us a weapon that we can use against them. We must use wild, insane, irrational illogic aimed right at Norman!#
KIRK: Let's get to the point. Harry, you said you wanted to help. Do you?#
KIRK: That's fine, Harry. The androids will be expecting us to make a break for it, and that's where you come in.#
KIRK: Nothing, Harry. Just go to sleep.#
KIRK: Oh, Harry. I do believe you're putting on weight.#
KIRK: We have a medical problem. Your ex-Lord, Harry Mudd.#
KIRK: We are caring for him, but our doctor needs his medical equipment aboard the Enterprise.#
KIRK: You are programmed to serve. If we're not allowed access to our medical equipment, Harry Mudd will die. He will cease to function. You will have failed to serve.#
KIRK: Oh, yes.#
KIRK: Uhura, why did you tell her?#
KIRK: Uhura. Beautiful!#
KIRK: Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland.#
KIRK: Yes. Your attention. (Scott and McCoy enter, bow to each other and then start playing imaginary flute and fiddle while Chekov and Uhura waltz.)#
KIRK: They're celebrating.#
KIRK: Their captivity. Do you enjoy the music?#
KIRK: She likes him. Mister Chekov. The floor is no place for an officer. Attention! Now stand absolutely still.#
KIRK: That's better, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Your statement is illogical.#
KIRK: Good. I wonder how Spock's doing.#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: If Norman is the control centre, he should be in a bind by what we've done. If we can overload him further, we should be able to immobilise all of them. Does everybody remember what to do?#
KIRK: Acknowledged.#
KIRK: I want you to surrender.#
KIRK: No, we are stronger. I'll prove it to you. Can you harm a man that you're programmed to serve?#
KIRK: Why not?#
KIRK: Scotty. Scotty's dead. He had too much happiness. But now he's happier he's dead, and we'll miss him. Let us hear it for our poor, dead friend.#
KIRK: What is a man but that lofty spirit, that sense of enterprise, that devotion to something that cannot be sensed, cannot be realised but only dreamed! The highest reality.#
KIRK: How did you like it?#
KIRK: Our logic is to be illogical. That is our advantage. Mister Spock, it is time. The explosive.#
KIRK: Watch it! Watch it!#
KIRK: No? Observe. Fore!  Boom!#
KIRK: Are you all right?#
KIRK: He lied. Everything Harry tells you is a lie. Remember that. Everything Harry tells you is a lie.#
KIRK: I am not programmed to respond in that area.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: Why, thank you.#
KIRK: A partnership arrangement? You and me?#
KIRK: I've got something else in mind. Let's go.#
KIRK: Touch�, Bones.#
KIRK: Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this planet.#
KIRK: No, you're an irritant. You'll stay here and provide a first-class example to the androids of a human failure. They'll learn by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future.#
KIRK: As long as you continue to be an irritant, Harry. It's up to you.#
KIRK: Yes, you are. Oh, there's one more thing, Harry. We've programmed a special android attendant to take care of your every need. She'll help you find an incentive to work with the androids and not exploit them.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Goodbye, Harry. Have fun.#
KIRK: Good. Mister Chekov, this flight is supposed to provide both experience and knowledge. How close will we come to the Klingon outpost if we continue on our present course?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, immediate past history of the quadrant?#
KIRK: Analysis of disputed area?#
KIRK: John Burke.#
KIRK: is the rest of your history that faulty, Ensign? Key points of dispute?#
KIRK: And unfortunately, though the Klingons are brutal and aggressive, they are most efficient.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Go to warp factor six.#
KIRK: Priority One distress call, and it's just absolutely peaceful. Lieutenant Uhura, break subspace silence.#
KIRK: Space Station K7, this is Captain Kirk of the Enterprise. What is your emergency?#
KIRK: Mister Lurry, you issued a Priority One distress call. State the nature of your emergency.#
KIRK: You'll try to explain. You'd better be prepared to do more than that. Kirk out. Mister Spock, I'll need your help. Mister Chekov, maintain battle readiness. Lieutenant Uhura, see that the transporter room is standing by.#
KIRK: Mister Lurry, if there's no emergency, why did you issue a priority one distress call?#
KIRK: And that gives you the authority to put an entire quadrant on defence alert?#
KIRK: Oh.#
KIRK: And this is my first officer Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Storage compartments? Storage compartments?#
KIRK: What? What? What's quadrotriticale? (Lurry hands him a small packet) Wheat. So what?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you've made your point.#
KIRK: You issued a priority one distress call for a couple of tons of wheat?#
KIRK: Mister Baris, you summoned the Enterprise without an emergency. You'll take full responsibility for it.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Secure from general quarters. And beam down two, and only two, security guards. Have them report to Mister Lurry. Authorise shore leave for all off-duty personnel.#
KIRK: Kirk out.#
KIRK: I have never questioned the orders or the intelligence of any representative of the Federation. Until now.#
KIRK: Summoning a starship on a priority A-1 channel to guard some storage compartments. Storage compartments of wheat.#
KIRK: I guess not. (downs his drink in one and heads for the door, where they meet Chekov and Uhura coming in.) KIRK: I see you didn't waste time taking your shore leave.#
KIRK:  Mister Chekov, what do you make of this?#
KIRK: Does everybody know about this wheat but me?#
KIRK: Ah.#
KIRK: Yes, what is it?#
KIRK: Put it on visual, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Now, that's just lovely.#
KIRK: Yes, Lieutenant, what is it?#
KIRK: Go to Red Alert. Notify Mister Lurry. We'll be right up.#
KIRK: What is the position of the Klingon ship?#
KIRK: Put him on visual.#
KIRK: Mister Lurry, there's a Klingon warship hanging one hundred kilometres off your station.#
KIRK: Why not?#
KIRK: Cancel Red Alert. We'll beam right down.#
KIRK: My dear Captain Koloth.#
KIRK: Shore leave?#
KIRK: Yes, well, I don't make those decisions. Mister Lurry is in charge of those matters.#
KIRK: Well, I have the authority to act, and I'm going to use it. My dear Captain Koloth, you may indeed bring your men down on shore leave, but only twelve at a time. And I assure you, for every man you bring down here, I shall have one security guard. There will be no trouble.#
KIRK: Let us both take steps to keep it that way.#
KIRK: Another technical journal, Scotty?#
KIRK: Don't you ever relax?#
KIRK: You running a nursery, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Did you get this at the space station?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Pipe it down here will you, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Baris. What can I do for you?#
KIRK: I was not aware, Mister Baris, that twelve Klingons constitutes a swarm.#
KIRK: Mister Baris, I have guards around the grain. I have guards around the Klingons. The only reason those guards are there is because Starfleet wants them there. As for what you want (pauses at a look from Spock) It has been noted and logged. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Sickbay with a headache.#
KIRK: Bones, what have you got for a headache?#
KIRK: Both. How many of these did Uhura give you?#
KIRK: But you've got, er, eleven.#
KIRK: How do they? How do they?#
KIRK: A fat tribble.#
KIRK: Well, Bones, all I can suggest is you open up a maternity ward.#
KIRK: All you men going on shore leave to stay in groups. Avoid trouble with the Klingons.#
KIRK: Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty?#
KIRK: I want you to go on shore leave. Make sure that everybody stays out of trouble.#
KIRK: Scotty, enjoy yourself.#
KIRK: I want to know who started it. I'm waiting. Freeman, who started the fight?#
KIRK: All right. Chekov. I know you. You started it, didn't you?#
KIRK: Who did?#
KIRK: I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All right. You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it. Dismissed.  Scotty, not you. You were supposed to prevent trouble, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Who threw the first punch, Scotty?#
KIRK: Mister Scott?#
KIRK: You did, Mister Scott? What caused it, Scotty?#
KIRK: Must have been some insult.#
KIRK: You threw the first punch.#
KIRK: You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight?#
KIRK: No, this is not off the record.#
KIRK: Is that all?#
KIRK: I see.#
KIRK: I get the picture, Scotty.#
KIRK: After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons?#
KIRK: No?#
KIRK: Oh, yes.#
KIRK: What was it they said that started the fight?#
KIRK: I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons?#
KIRK: You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not because they#
KIRK: All right, Scotty. Dismissed. Scotty, you're restricted to quarters until further notice.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge? (he takes a walk around then) Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on the bridge?#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: Explain that.#
KIRK: I know, but really#
KIRK: Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a good thing.#
KIRK: Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then contact Mister Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down.#
KIRK: Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him.#
KIRK: And get these tribbles off the bridge.#
KIRK: Oh, really?#
KIRK: Just incredibly prolific.#
KIRK: You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this thing.#
KIRK: On the contrary, sir. I think of this project as very important. It is you I take lightly.#
KIRK: That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring?#
KIRK: Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent?#
KIRK: I heard you.#
KIRK: What evidence do you have against Mister Jones?#
KIRK: Yes, yes. Go on. What else do you have?#
KIRK: Do you have any proof of that?#
KIRK: People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon agents. Sometimes, all they need is a title, Mister Baris. Unfortunately, disrupting a space station is not an offence. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a ship to tend to. Au revoir.#
KIRK: My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee.#
KIRK: I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man we've got, I want them off the ship.#
KIRK: How?#
KIRK: And in the storage compartments.  This is Kirk. Contact Manager Lurry and Nilz Baris. Have them meet us near the storage compartments. We're beaming down. Come on, Spock.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened.#
KIRK: Is that door secure?#
KIRK: Good. Open it.#
KIRK: Here. Let me try it. (But he can't open it either, so he tried one of the overhead doors instead. That does open, and a whole load of tribbles fall out, burying the gallant Captain up to his shoulders. Spock examines one.)#
KIRK: Hundreds of thousands.#
KIRK: That's assuming they got here three days ago.#
KIRK: Mister Baris#
KIRK: Mister Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up.#
KIRK: Now he tells me.#
KIRK: Yes. Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed. I want to know what killed these tribbles.#
KIRK: Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain. And as Captain, I want two things done. First, find Cyrano Jones, and second (as another tribble hits him on the head) close that door.#
KIRK: Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions.#
KIRK: What do you want?#
KIRK: An apology?#
KIRK: Well, we'll see about that, but before I take any official action, I'd like to know Just what happened. Who put the tribbles in the quadrotriticale? What was in the grain that killed them?#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Hold on a minute. I thought you said tribbles liked everybody.#
KIRK: What was in the bar?#
KIRK: You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons. (McCoy enters) But they do like Vulcans. I didn't know you had it in you.#
KIRK: Obviously. Mister Baris, they like you. Well, there's no accounting for taste.  They don't like you, Mister Darvin. I wonder why. Bones?#
KIRK: I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that. What about the grain, Bones?#
KIRK: They starved to death. In a storage compartment full of grain, they starved to death.#
KIRK: Mister Darvin, are you going to talk?#
KIRK: And the tribbles had nothing to do with it?#
KIRK: Captain Koloth. About that apology.#
KIRK: You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory. (The tribbles shriek, Koloth makes a hasty bow and practically runs out of the room with Korax.) KIRK: You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles.#
KIRK: No, you're not. There's something I want to show you. You know what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human life?#
KIRK: There is one thing you can do.#
KIRK: Pick up every tribble on the space station. If you do that, I'll speak to Mister Lurry about returning your spaceship.#
KIRK: Consider it Job security.#
KIRK: You'll do it?#
KIRK: Good. That means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale only a few weeks late. I don't see any tribbles around here.#
KIRK: Bones, how did you do it?#
KIRK: Scotty! Where are the tribbles?#
KIRK: Of course. Spock.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I don't want to interrupt this mutual admiration society, but I'd like to know where the tribbles are.#
KIRK: Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles?#
KIRK: You used the transporter?#
KIRK: Where did you transport them? Scott, you didn't transport them into space, did you?#
KIRK: Where are they?#
KIRK:  Where?#
KIRK:  You gave them to the Klingons?#
KIRK: Missing for six years, and now this junk in space.#
KIRK: Then whatever destroyed the ship, the crew was able to get off safely. Navigator, compute the present drift of the wreckage.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same speed and direction for the past six years?#
KIRK: Standard orbit around the planet. There may be survivors there.#
KIRK: Yes, at the academy. He was dropped in his fifth year. He went into the merchant service.#
KIRK: Put it on the screen.#
KIRK: Yes, similar. But the land masses and oceans are quite different, however.#
KIRK: Exactly in some ways, different in others.#
KIRK: What era?#
KIRK: Put it on the screen.#
KIRK: Slaves and gladiators. What are we seeing, a twentieth-century Rome?#
KIRK: Ready the transporter room, Mister Spock. We're beaming down.#
KIRK: You could have selected a more convenient place, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: The SS Beagle was the first ship to make a survey of this star sector when it disappeared.#
KIRK: No identification of self or mission. No interference with the social development of said planet.#
KIRK: Let's go.#
KIRK: I think he means it, Spock.#
KIRK: We come from another province.#
KIRK: We come from a place that's quite some journey from here. I doubt if you've heard#
KIRK: Do we look like any Romans you ever saw ?#
KIRK: Our people don't believe in slavery.#
KIRK: Wait. I can prove we're telling the truth. A small device. I'll take it out slowly.  Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: Scotty, lock in on my transmission beam. Scan us.#
KIRK: Including ourselves, how many of us are there?#
KIRK: Good, Scotty. Continue scanning. We'll maintain transmission. Kirk out. The Enterprise is our ship, somewhere at sea. That's all I can tell you. If it isn't sufficient, you will have to kill us.#
KIRK: Perhaps you've heard, let's say, an impossible story or a rumour of men who came from the sky or from other worlds.#
KIRK: The stars.#
KIRK: Yes, of course.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK:  The Jupiter Eight. Conventional internal combustion engine. You were right about the smog. But the Jupiter Eight? Mars toothpaste. Neptune bath salts.#
KIRK: Septimus, we need your help. We must go into the city. We know that one of our missing friends was seen there recently.#
KIRK: We can't do that. Perhaps you know his name. Merik. Captain Merik.#
KIRK: Yes. He's the leader of our friends.#
KIRK: That doesn't sound like the same man.#
KIRK: Septimus, wherever we may be from, you must believe that it is one of our most important laws that none of us interfere with the affairs of others. If Captain Merik is Merikus, then he has violated that law, and he must be taken away and punished. Will you help us get to the truth of all this?#
KIRK: He failed a psycho-simulator test. All it takes is a split second of indecision. Hardly the type to become a political strongman.#
KIRK: Are you a slave, Flavius?#
KIRK: Then you heard the word of the sun?#
KIRK: There are many things I'd like to know#
KIRK: Tell Merikus I'd like to see him.#
KIRK: Tell him it's Jim Kirk. Perhaps a friend.#
KIRK: Well, if I am a friend and you don't tell him, do you really want to risk that? (They are locked in and left alone. McCoy tends to Flavius's head wound.) KIRK: But if there have been slaves for over 2,000 years, hasn't there always been discontent, runaways?#
KIRK: I'm not sure they're sure. When the slaves began to worship the sun, they became discontent again. When did all this happen?#
KIRK: You go on believing it, Flavius. All men are brothers.#
KIRK: Three against three. We may never get a better chance.#
KIRK:  I doubt if he'll get very far. He feels ill.#
KIRK: All right, but he'll double over before we get very far. (Spock and Kirk take McCoy's arms.)#
KIRK: Let's go.#
KIRK: Captain Merik, isn't it ?#
KIRK: I agree.#
KIRK: McCoy.#
KIRK: All right, what happened?#
KIRK: Go on.#
KIRK: What happened to your crew? Did they voluntarily beam, come ashore?#
KIRK: What happened to your crew?#
KIRK: My world, proconsul, is my vessel, my oath, my crew. What happened to your vessel you've explained. What happened to your oath is obvious.#
KIRK: You sent your own men into the arena?#
KIRK: Do you really believe I could be made to order my own people down?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Scotty, if you have a fix.  Stand by, Scotty.#
KIRK: Yet on the other hand, my chief engineer's standing by for a message.#
KIRK: If I brought down a hundred of them armed with phasers#
KIRK: Scotty. Sorry to keep you waiting.#
KIRK: Condition Green, all's well. Kirk out.#
KIRK: The rules. If Spock should finish his man off first, would he be able to help#
KIRK: Proconsul, in some parts of the galaxy I have seen forms of entertainment that makes this look like a folk dance.#
KIRK: I've had to select men to die before so that others could be saved.#
KIRK: It won't work.#
KIRK: Whatever he has in mind, whatever tricks. You hear that, Proconsul? It won't work. I'm not co-operating. I may die, but you won't get any entertainment out of it.#
KIRK: Very good.  Excellent.#
KIRK: I've been in some strange worlds with strange customs. Perhaps this is considered torture here.#
KIRK: You'll be the first to know.#
KIRK: Nothing except perhaps an explanation.#
KIRK: I appreciate that.#
KIRK: Of course.#
KIRK: I thank you. And my friends?#
KIRK: I've heard it was similar. Enterprise log, Engineer Scott reporting. All banks in readiness for disruption of power sources on the planet's surface.#
KIRK: Stand back.#
KIRK: Obsolete, but effective.#
KIRK: They threw me a few curves. No time to explain.#
KIRK: And strong personal feelings, he obeyed the Prime Directive. His temporary blackout of the city below resulted in no interference with the society and yet saved the lives of myself and the landing party.#
KIRK: Gentlemen.#
KIRK: Caesar and Christ. They had them both. And the word is spreading only now.#
KIRK: Wouldn't it be something to watch, to be a part of? To see it happen all over again? Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit. Ahead warp factor one.#
KIRK: The Vulcans are the last delegates we have to pick up. As soon as we get them aboard, we'll be able to relax.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Bring them aboard, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Captain James Kirk.#
KIRK: My First Officer, Commander Spock.#
KIRK: Thank you. Chief Medical Officer Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: Our pleasure, madam. As soon as you're settled I'll arrange a tour of the ship. Mister Spock will conduct you.#
KIRK: As you wish, Ambassador. Mister Spock, we'll leave orbit in two hours. Would you care to beam down and visit your parents?#
KIRK: This is the engineering section. There are a number of emergency back-up systems for the main controls. Over here are a number of control computers.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. A moment, if you please.#
KIRK: Explain the computer components.#
KIRK: I'm sorry, Ambassador. I did not mean to offend. I thought that#
KIRK: Mrs. Sarek, I just don't understand.#
KIRK: Can you?#
KIRK: It sounded more like a command.#
KIRK: And Spock is his son.#
KIRK: Spock is my best officer, and my friend.#
KIRK: I take it that Spock disagreed with his father on a choice of career.#
KIRK: Starfleet force is used only as a last resort. We're an instrument of civilisation. And it's a better opportunity for a scientist to study the universe than he can get at the Vulcan Science Academy.#
KIRK: They are both stubborn.#
KIRK: Excuse me. Kirk here.#
KIRK: Source?#
KIRK: Go to alert status four. Begin long-range scanning. Kirk out. Captain's log, Stardate 3842.4. The interplanetary conference will consider the petition of the Coridan planets to be admitted to the Federation. The Coridan system has been claimed by some of the races now aboard our ship as delegates, races who have strong personal reasons for keeping Coridan out of the Federation. The most pressing problem aboard the Enterprise is to make sure open warfare doesn't break out among the delegates before the conference begins.#
KIRK: Ambassador.#
KIRK: Gentlemen. Ambassador Sarek is quite correct when he points out this is not the council chamber of Babel. I'm fully aware that the admission of Coridan is a highly debatable issue, but you won't solve it here.#
KIRK: Ambassador.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: On my way. All duty personnel on Yellow Alert. Don't alarm the passengers. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: Identification, Spock?#
KIRK: Does she answer a hail?#
KIRK: Care to guess what she is?#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, plot course to intercept that vessel. I want to see what she looks like close up.#
KIRK: Ready main phasers.#
KIRK: Back on original course, Mister Chekov. Report on intruder's movements.#
KIRK: Well, we have a shadow. Faster, more manoeuvrable and unidentified. Mister Spock, full analysis of sensor readings. I want to know who that intruder is.#
KIRK: Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Whatever arguments you have between yourselves is your business. My business is running the ship. As long as I command, there will be order.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: How was he killed?#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: Who aboard would have that knowledge?#
KIRK: Spock. A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and your father.#
KIRK: You're saying he couldn't have done it?#
KIRK: But if he had a reason, could he have done it?#
KIRK: Mrs. Sarek, I'm sorry to disturb you. I must speak to your husband.#
KIRK: Ambassador, the Tellarite. Gav has been murdered.#
KIRK: Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour?#
KIRK: Then where were you during the hour?#
KIRK: That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador.#
KIRK: Can you help him?#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: I'm sorry about your father.#
KIRK: Aren't you worried about him?#
KIRK: I see. Well, the Romulans have nothing like it. Certainly not the Federation or the neutral planets. What about the Klingons?#
KIRK: Who, then?#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, directional locator indicates source bearing twenty seven, mark eight.#
KIRK: Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: A personal receiver? Somebody on board is in contact with that vessel?#
KIRK: Why not?#
KIRK: Are any conclusions possible from the information?#
KIRK: Murder? Someone out there playing tag? Lieutenant, you've got your sensor locator on a wide beam. You've established a receiver on board this vessel. Tighten your field to the interior of the ship.#
KIRK: If that alien vessel starts transmitting again, I want to know who on board the Enterprise is receiving.#
KIRK: Bones, how is he?#
KIRK: Ambassador, when did you have these attacks?#
KIRK: There were no witnesses?#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: Bones, what about it?#
KIRK: There are other Vulcans aboard.#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: Bridge. Spock.#
KIRK: I'm on deck five, near my quarters. I've been attacked by an Andorian. Security. Security team.#
KIRK: I'd like to get my hands on the guy with the sledgehammer.#
KIRK: No, the one inside my head. How long have I#
KIRK: How's Sarek?#
KIRK: What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready.#
KIRK: I can't damn him for his loyalty, for doing his duty, but I'm not going to let him commit patricide.#
KIRK: Bones, Sarek will die without that operation, and you can't operate without transfusions from Spock. I'll convince Spock I'm all right and order him to report here. As soon as he leaves the bridge, I'll turn command over to Scotty and report to my quarters. Will that fill your prescription?#
KIRK: I'll take over, Mister Spock. You report to Sickbay with Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: Get out, Spock. Chekov, what's the status of the intruder?#
KIRK: Any further transmissions, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Call Mister Scott to the bridge.#
KIRK: Belay that order. I'll stay here.#
KIRK: Specific origin?#
KIRK: Security? Security to the brig. Search the prisoner immediately.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Bring the prisoner to the bridge. Deflectors on. Red Alert. Phasers stand by to fire on my order.#
KIRK: Chekov, take over Spock's scanners.#
KIRK: Target, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Fire as he passes, Ensign.#
KIRK: Report on his weaponry, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Standard phasers. Good. They may have more speed, but they're not giants.#
KIRK: Tell them to take a good guess, but clear that board, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: On my order, fire photon torpedoes two, four and six. Widest possible scatter.#
KIRK: Fire.#
KIRK: Auxiliary power.#
KIRK: Your friends out there are good. They'll have to destroy this ship to win.#
KIRK: You're not Andorian. Who are you?#
KIRK: Damage control procedures, all decks. That ship out there has phasers. At least our weapons are alike.#
KIRK: Engineering, this is the Captain. Cut power on port side except for phaser banks. At my signal, cut starboard power. Kirk out. Who are you?#
KIRK: You're a spy, surgically altered to pass as an Andorian. Planted in the ambassador's party to use terror and murder to disrupt us and prepare for this attack.#
KIRK: Engineering, cut power on starboard side. Maintain until further orders. Chekov.#
KIRK: You speculate.#
KIRK: No. Stand by your phasers, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Looking us over. We're dead as far as he knows.#
KIRK: Hold your fire, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Fire.#
KIRK: Secure from general quarters. Lieutenant, open the hailing frequency. If they wish to surrender#
KIRK: Lieutenant, relay to Starfleet command. Tell them we have a prisoner.#
KIRK: Take him to Sickbay.#
KIRK: So did they. Mister Chekov, take over.#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: Spock, Sarek how are they?#
KIRK: Bones!#
KIRK: Some doctors have all the luck.#
KIRK: We damaged their ship. They destroyed themselves to avoid capture. Bones, Thelev's body will be brought to your lab. I want an autopsy performed as soon as possible.#
KIRK: But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet?#
KIRK: Yes, of course. With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan.#
KIRK: You might have had something else on your mind.#
KIRK: No, but thank you anyway.#
KIRK: Bones.  No, no, I'm all right#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this.#
KIRK: No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Yes, the mugato. No problem, though. Those prints are several days old. They seldom stay in one place.#
KIRK: Or so it seemed to the brash young Lieutenant Kirk on his first planet survey.#
KIRK: Except these people stayed in their Garden of Eden. Bows and arrows for hunting, but absolutely no fighting among themselves. Remarkably peaceful and tranquil.#
KIRK: Villagers with flintlocks? That's impossible. They hadn't progressed nearly that far.#
KIRK: One of those men walking into ambush is Tyree. The friend I lived with here.#
KIRK: Spock? Your phaser. (it is missing, so Kirk prepares to use his to defend his friend.)#
KIRK: Beam us up, quickly.#
KIRK: Lead projectile. Primitive firearm.#
KIRK: Bones, can you save him?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: On my way. Scotty. Bones?#
KIRK: Good. Go to Yellow Alert.#
KIRK: Do you think you can keep us out of their sight, Chekov?#
KIRK: No point in giving ourselves away, Lieutenant. Not until we find out what's going on.#
KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay.#
KIRK: So, they've broken the treaty.#
KIRK: Research is not the Klingon way.#
KIRK: When I left there thirteen years ago, those villagers had barely learned to forge iron. Spock was shot with a flintlock. How many centuries between those two developments?#
KIRK: Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott.;#
KIRK: I did not invite a debate. I'm sorry. I'm worried about Spock and concerned about what's happened to something I once knew down there. You have the conn, Scotty. I'll be in Sickbay.#
KIRK: Then you and I are transporting down.#
KIRK: You just indicated you could. There are Klingons here. If their mission is a legitimate research interest in the planet's organic potential, then you're the one man who can tell me.#
KIRK: Then I need help. Advice I can trust as much as Spock's.#
KIRK: Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are, but if the Klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war. Kirk to Bridge.#
KIRK: McCoy and I are transporting back down. Inform ship's stores that we'll need native costumes.#
KIRK: I understand. We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule. Kirk out. Captain's log, stardate 4211.4. Keeping our presence here secret is an enormous tactical advantage, therefore I cannot risk contact with Starfleet Command. I must take action on my own judgment. I've elected to violate orders and make contact with planet inhabitants.#
KIRK: Perfect. Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away.#
KIRK: No interference with normal social development. I'm not only aware of it, it was my survey thirteen years ago that recommended it.#
KIRK: Indeed. And I intend to see that they have that chance. You coming with me?#
KIRK:  Contact ship. Took full poison. Fangs.#
KIRK: They left. Out of orbit.#
KIRK: Tyree. Some of his men. Cure.#
KIRK: Bones. I had the strangest dream.#
KIRK: Tired. Very tired. You did a fine job, Bones. I think I'll sleep.#
KIRK: Bones. What are you doing here?  Tyree. My old friend.#
KIRK: What am I doing here? A mugato bite! I remember. I told him to take me to Tyree's camp. I knew you'd find a kahn-ut-tu to cure me. The kahn-ut-tu is the local witch people here. They've studied (Nona gets up and stands in front of him) They've studied the roots and the herbs.#
KIRK: Yes, of course. I should've guessed. Congratulations. Tyree, we must talk now. The villagers, their new weapons. I want to hear all about that. We must make plans.#
KIRK: You say they make the firesticks themselves? How can you be sure?#
KIRK: Can you take us to their village while it's still dark?#
KIRK:  You've seen how these work.#
KIRK: We're simply strangers from#
KIRK: I am grateful.#
KIRK: We once were as you are, Spears, arrows. There came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed ourselves. We learned from this to make a rule during all our travels, Never to cause the same to happen to other worlds. Just as a man must grow in his own way and in his own time.#
KIRK: Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should. But we're wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with the way of a man or another world.#
KIRK: That's what's bothering me. The something we may have to do.#
KIRK: Tyree, supposing you had to fight? What then?#
KIRK: Tyree?#
KIRK: The gun. Ammunition. Doctor.#
KIRK: Let's take a look inside.#
KIRK: Well, here's your forge. People's exhibit number one. A chrome steel drill point.#
KIRK: Make recorder and scanner tapes of everything.#
KIRK: Bones! (They open the door, but there are two more armed villagers outside. Nevertheless, they knock them out and get away.)#
KIRK:  Move! Fast!#
KIRK: Men, this is the pan. This is the hammer. The hammer striking the pan causes a spark, ignites the powder, and fires the flintlock. Now aim it as I showed you. Hold your breath and squeeze the trigger gently.  Well done. Very, very, very good.#
KIRK: Not here, Bones. In the cave. Yutan, your turn.#
KIRK: Exactly. Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm.#
KIRK: Superstition.#
KIRK: Is it? She wants superior weapons. That's the one thing neither side can have. Bones. Bones, the normal development of this planet was the status quo between the hill people and the villagers. The Klingons changed that with the flintlocks. If this planet is to develop the way it should, we must equalize both sides again.#
KIRK: All right, Doctor! All right. Say I'm wrong. Say I'm drugged. Say the woman drugged me. What is your sober, sensible solution to all this?#
KIRK: Bones, do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the Asian continent? Two giant powers involved, much like the Klingons and ourselves. Neither side felt could pull out.#
KIRK: What would you have suggested, that one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon? Mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had. No. The only solution is what happened back then. Balance of power.#
KIRK: Then we arm our side with exactly that much more. A balance of power. The trickiest, most difficult, dirtiest game of them all, but the only one that preserves both sides.#
KIRK: No. Probably not. But I'm going to have to try and make him understand. I never had a more difficult task.#
KIRK: Well, war isn't a good life, but it's life. His wife is the only way to reach him. If I tell her we're going to supply guns, maybe she'll convince him.#
KIRK: Nona. Pardon me.#
KIRK: Oh? I thought it was my idea.#
KIRK: Nona#
KIRK: I'd like to talk to you.#
KIRK: I would like#
KIRK: I feel dizzy. Yes, you are lovely. You're beautiful.#
KIRK: Nona.#
KIRK: No, no. I'm all right. My phaser. She took it.#
KIRK: Tomorrow in the palm of her hands.#
KIRK: Not what I wanted, Bones. What had to be. (McCoy hands him a communicator from his bag) Kirk here. SPOCK  Spock, Captain. I trust all has gone well.#
KIRK: Spock, ask Scotty how long it would take him to reproduce a hundred flintlocks.#
KIRK: A hundred serpents. Serpents for the Garden of Eden. We're very tired, Mister Spock. Beam us up home.#
KIRK: Ensign Chekov, Lieutenant Uhura, and I will beam down and make a routine check of its facilities.#
KIRK: Good. Mind the store, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, let's go.#
KIRK: Energise, Scotty.#
KIRK: It must be a transporter malfunction.#
KIRK: This isn't Gamma Two. Look at the colour of that sky. (it's green)#
KIRK: That's a trinary sun.#
KIRK: That's what I'd like to know. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Dead.#
KIRK: Phasers on stun. Fire.  Hand-to-hand. (The men go one-on-one while Uhura has to deal with both women simultaneously. They are not fairly matched. Chekov cannot handle the giant and Uhura quickly gives up. Only Kirk acquits himself well against the normal male, until green-hair intervenes with her weapon.) Captain's log, stardate 3211.8. While beaming down from the Enterprise to inspect facilities on Gamma Two, the normal transporter sequence has been interrupted, and we find ourselves on a strange and hostile planet, surrounded by creatures belonging to races scattered all through the galaxy.#
KIRK: Either of you hurt?#
KIRK: How do you know our names?#
KIRK: These Providers of yours, are they#
KIRK: What do they want from us?#
KIRK: Thralls? You must be mistaken. We're officers of a United spaceship on Federation business.#
KIRK: We're not going anywhere until we have some information. Who are you? What is this place? What do you think you're going to do with us?#
KIRK: This system's star is a trinary. Limits it a bit, but we're a long way from the Enterprise, if we're in the same dimension.#
KIRK: What do you want from her?#
KIRK: Lieutenant, are you all right? Uhura! Lieutenant! Lieutenant, are you all right? Lieutenant, answer me! Lieutenant! What's happening to Lieutenant Uhura? Lieutenant, are you all right?#
KIRK: I didn't realise I was so hungry. Whatever you call this, it is very good.#
KIRK: Nourishment. That's very practical. What do you call this collar?#
KIRK: Vended? You mean bought, sold.#
KIRK: Our race has another name for it. Slavery. This collar of obedience, is Galt the only one who can operate it?#
KIRK: How does he work it?#
KIRK: Will you provide all my nourishment?#
KIRK: It means you're a very beautiful woman.#
KIRK: Your parents. Where are they? Your mother and father.#
KIRK: Freestyle?#
KIRK: Lars and Chekov's drill thrall. They weren't born here. Where do they come from?#
KIRK: None of us will do it, Galt.#
KIRK: The devil with the Providers.#
KIRK: No. No! I am responsible for the actions of my people. I demand to see the Providers.#
KIRK: He's pretty fast with that whip.#
KIRK: We're free people. We belong to no one.#
KIRK: Slow down. Slow down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We've covered over two miles. Can we take a breather? A rest?#
KIRK: Oh. well, it's good to get away from that development area, even for a while. Shahna, why do the Providers, why do they like to watch others being hurt, killed?#
KIRK: Their voices sound mechanical. Are they computers?#
KIRK: You've seen them. Do they have bodies?#
KIRK: What is this place?#
KIRK: It's very old. Does it have a name? Shahna, could it have been a city for the Providers?#
KIRK: They do have bodies, or did have.#
KIRK: Very pretty country. Very much like my home planet, Earth.#
KIRK: Where I was born. Shahna, don't you ever look at the night sky? The lights up there?#
KIRK: Well, those are stars. And around them are planets. And there are people that live on them, Just like us.#
KIRK: From Earth, Triskelion's three suns are just a flicker of light. Actually, this is the darkest planet I've ever seen.#
KIRK: The thralls have no freedom, Shahna. You don't think or do anything but what the Providers tell you.#
KIRK: Love, for one thing.#
KIRK: Love is the most important thing on Earth. Especially to a man and a woman.#
KIRK: On Earth, we select our own mate. Someone we care for. On Earth, men and women live together, help each other, make each other happy.#
KIRK: All right. All right. Tell me about the Providers. What do they look like? Where do they live?#
KIRK: Stop it. Stop it! I'm responsible! I made her talk! Stop it! You're killing her! She did nothing wrong! It was my fault. If you want to punish someone, punish me! Please.#
KIRK: It's all right. It's all right. You can stop crying now, Shahna. It's all right.#
KIRK: It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in trouble.#
KIRK: You could call it that.#
KIRK: You're disturbed about what happened today.#
KIRK: I wouldn't like that, Shahna. I wouldn't like that at all.#
KIRK: I'm sorry, Shahna.#
KIRK: What about Lars?#
KIRK: I think Galt is the only one who controls these collars. If we can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to short out these collars.#
KIRK: Spock? Spock!#
KIRK: Welcome to Triskelion, gentlemen.#
KIRK: Providing for all their needs means using thralls, people stolen from other parts of the galaxy#
KIRK: But you are afraid.#
KIRK: Then show yourselves.#
KIRK: The power source. Shielded by solid rock.#
KIRK: Primary mental evolution. Incredible.#
KIRK: A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally or otherwise.#
KIRK: It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect.#
KIRK: We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior development. Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe.#
KIRK: Our destruction will result only in your own. You may control the Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation.#
KIRK: And you call yourselves superior! You're murderers without the spirit to really wager for the lives you take.#
KIRK: My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful gamblers in the universe. We compete for everything. Power, fame, women, everything we desire, and it is our nature to win. And for proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy.#
KIRK: Well, then, I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls set against us.#
KIRK: Wait! Wait! Hear me! We can't wager for trifles like quatloos. The stakes must be higher.#
KIRK: If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety. Further more, all the thralls on the planet must be freed.#
KIRK: You will educate and train them to establish a normal self-governing culture.#
KIRK: We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy. Are you willing to admit that we can do something you can't?#
KIRK: If we lose? We will remain here, the entire crew of the Enterprise. The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe. We'll become thralls, enter your games, obey your orders without rebellion. You'll be assured of generations of the most exciting wagering you've ever had.#
KIRK: Not for true gamesters.#
KIRK: Name it.#
KIRK: Three against one? Those are pretty high odds.#
KIRK: Your, your terms are unfair.#
KIRK: Yes, that's clear.#
KIRK: The thralls will be trained?#
KIRK: I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one you've been playing. I'm sorry, Shahna. I didn't lie. I did what was necessary. Someday, I hope you'll understand.#
KIRK: I can't.#
KIRK: Beam us up.#
KIRK: Fantastic. 20 times as hard as diamond.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock.  Scotty, you can mark this vein as confirmed. Inform Starfleet I recommend that they dispatch a survey vessel immediately. (Unseen by the landing party, a cloud of smoke is coming out of another rock and heading for them.)#
KIRK: Lesley.#
KIRK: Do you smell that? A sweet odour like honey. It was years ago, on another planet. A thing with a an odour like that.#
KIRK: Rizzo.#
KIRK: Take your men. Make a swing around our perimeter. Scan for dikironium in the atmosphere. Set your phasers on disrupter-B. If you see any gaseous cloud, fire immediately. You're on Red Alert. Make a sweep.#
KIRK: Negative, Scotty. We're checking something out.#
KIRK: Acknowledged. Continue standing by. Kirk out.#
KIRK: It's gone. I could have been wrong. The last time I caught an odour like that was eleven years ago.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Fire into it immediately!#
KIRK: Spock. Dead. And you'll find every red corpuscle gone from their body.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, lock in on us. Medical emergency.#
KIRK: Something that can't possibly exist, but it does. Captain's log, stardate 3619.2. With the mysterious death of two crewmen, all personnel on the planet have been evacuated back to the ship.#
KIRK: How's Ensign Rizzo?#
KIRK: Kirk to bridge.#
KIRK: Hold your position.#
KIRK: Then you'll inform them that we might be a little late.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, we are remaining in orbit until I find out more about those deaths, on my responsibility. I am perfectly aware that it might cost lives on Theta Seven. Kirk out. Autopsy report.#
KIRK: Marks, cuts, incisions of any kind?#
KIRK: I suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar occurrences. You'll find the USS Farragut lists casualties eleven years ago from exactly the same impossible causes.#
KIRK: First, can you bring Ensign Rizzo to consciousness for a moment?#
KIRK: Will it hurt him if you do so?#
KIRK: Then do so.#
KIRK: Rizzo. This is the captain. Can you hear me? Do you remember what happened to you?#
KIRK: You were attacked by something. When it happened, did you notice an odour of any kind? Rizzo. Rizzo! Do you remember a sickly sweet odour? Did you smell it?#
KIRK: Did you feel a presence, an intelligence?#
KIRK: He's already told me what I wanted to know.#
KIRK: You check those record tapes. I want your medical analysis as quickly as possible.#
KIRK: Not now. Have the security duty officer report to me immediately.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Let's assume that it's something so completely different that our sensors wouldn't identify it as a life form.#
KIRK: Suppose it was composed of that rare element. A strange, gaseous creature.#
KIRK: Suppose it camouflaged itself. Let's assume that it's intelligent, that it knows we're looking for it.#
KIRK: You've just suggested something that never occurred to me. It may provide some answers to a tape record which I think you'll find Doctor McCoy is looking at this very moment.#
KIRK: Are you the new security officer?#
KIRK: Was your father#
KIRK: You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister.#
KIRK: You knew Rizzo?#
KIRK: I want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect. Join me in the transporter room in five minutes. You'll accompany me to the planet surface.#
KIRK: Spock was right. Notice the molecular shift?;#
KIRK: Over that rise. Take two men, circle around to the left. I'll take the other two and go the other way. That creature is dangerous. If you see it, fire full phasers.#
KIRK: Swensen, Bardoli come with me. (Garrovick and his group go into a clearing, and the cloud emerges. Garrovick fires at it after a slight hesitation.) KIRK: A phaser! Come on!  Garrovick, did you? (But then he sees the other two security men, lying on the ground, skin pale as snow.) Captain's log, stardate 3619.6. One of the men in critical condition, the other is dead. And I, I am now even more convinced that this is not only an intelligent creature, but the same which decimated the crew of the USS Farragut eleven years ago in another part of the galaxy. Both Spock and McCoy are doubtful of this, and I sense they also doubt my decision to stay and fight the thing. Why am I keeping the ship here?#
KIRK: Mister Garrovick, we've studied your report. Mister Spock, begin.#
KIRK: But you didn't come to actual contact with it, did you?#
KIRK: Did you say it hovered?#
KIRK: You did fire at it, didn't you?#
KIRK: What distance were you from the creature?#
KIRK: You fired at a large, hovering target at that distance and missed?#
KIRK: You mean you froze?#
KIRK: What exactly were you doing?#
KIRK: Do you have any further information?#
KIRK: Do you gentlemen have any further questions?#
KIRK: Ensign, you're relieved of all duties and confined to quarters until further notice.#
KIRK: He froze. One man was killed. Another may die.#
KIRK: You'll both be filing reports. Make your comments and recommendations then.#
KIRK: We're not leaving orbit, Mister Scott. Not that quickly.#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: I'm aware of the situation, Engineer, and I'm getting a little tired of my senior officers conspiring against me. Forgive me. Perhaps I shouldn't have used the word conspire.#
KIRK: Scanner readings?#
KIRK: Are you aware it can change its molecular structure?#
KIRK: Are you scanning for any unusual movement?#
KIRK: Any type of gaseous cloud?#
KIRK: Kirk to bridge. Scanning report.#
KIRK: Maintain search. Kirk out. It can't have just vanished.#
KIRK: Get to the point.#
KIRK: Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision. You're straying out of your field, Doctor.#
KIRK: Because I delayed in firing at it.#
KIRK: If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed.#
KIRK: Don't you understand? It killed two hundred crewmen.#
KIRK: Yes. He was my commanding officer from the day I left the Academy. One of the finest men I ever knew. I could have killed that thing if I'd fired soon enough the first time.#
KIRK: I can't help how I feel. There's an intelligence about it, Bones. A malevolence. It's evil. It must be destroyed.#
KIRK: Obsessed?#
KIRK: Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take official#
KIRK: Do I take it, Doctor, Commander, that both of you or either of you consider me unfit or incapacitated?#
KIRK: Blast it! Forget the manual! Ask your questions.#
KIRK: Skip the recitation, Spock. I know the facts.#
KIRK: Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that attacked the Farragut eleven years ago.#
KIRK: My report is on the tapes. As it attacked us eleven years ago, as I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing. I could sense it thinking, planning.#
KIRK: Whatever it is, Doctor, whatever it is, wouldn't you call it deadly?#
KIRK: And what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years ago from a planet over a thousand light years from here?#
KIRK: A lot of ifs, I agree, but in my command judgment, they out weigh other factors. Intuition, however illogical, Mister Spock, is recognized as a command prerogative.#
KIRK: And you haven't, Doctor. You've expressed the proper concern, you've asked the proper questions. You've both done your duty. Now may I ask what medical log entry you intend to make?#
KIRK: In that case, gentlemen#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: All decks, Red Alert. Red alert. Prepare to leave orbit.#
KIRK: Range, Mister Chekov?#
KIRK: If necessary. Do what you can to increase our speed, Scott.#
KIRK: Extreme magnification, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Spock, how do you read that?#
KIRK: And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: We won't be using the impulse engines. Turn the alarm off.#
KIRK: Reduce speed. Approach slowly.#
KIRK: Maybe it's decided to fight. Phasers ready?#
KIRK: Move in closely, Mister Chekov. Sublight one quarter speed.#
KIRK: Lock all phasers on target.#
KIRK: Fire phasers, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Photon torpedoes. Minimum spread pattern.#
KIRK: Fire photon torpedoes.#
KIRK: Deflectors up.#
KIRK:  Lieutenant Uhura, all decks (rest of speech lost under Chekov's increasing volume)#
KIRK: Negative pressure in all ship's vents. Alert all decks.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: That's enough, Bones.#
KIRK: Yes, well, it could have been many light years away from us. Instead it chose to turn and attack here. Why?#
KIRK: Scotty, try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation system. See what effect that has.#
KIRK: If you want to play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me. My concern is with the ship and the crew.#
KIRK: On my way, Garrovick. Security to three four one. Medical alert. Scotty, reverse cabin pressure three four one.#
KIRK: Security, hold it. Tricorder.#
KIRK: If we let that thing into the ship, he'll have a lot of company.#
KIRK: See if the reverse pressure has pulled it back into the ventilation system.#
KIRK: Don't misunderstand my next question. Mister Spock, why aren't you dead?#
KIRK: Yes. The scent is different. I think I understand something now.#
KIRK: I don't know what it is, Mister Spock, but you remember I said the thing was alive. It may not be communication as we understand it, but I did know it was alive and intelligent, and I think I know something else now.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Open the vent. On my way to the bridge. Kirk out. Ensign Garrovick.#
KIRK: You were on the bridge when we were attacked.#
KIRK: Very commendable, Ensign. What was your impression of the battle?#
KIRK: I'm asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used against the creature.#
KIRK: And Ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet?#
KIRK: If you hadn't delayed firing? No difference, Ensign. No weapon known would have made any difference. Then or eleven years ago. Report for duty, Ensign.#
KIRK: Report, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK:  Mister Scott, I'll need all the speed you can deliver. Keep at it until we begin to shake apart. Kirk out. I believe I know where it's going.#
KIRK: No, I'm playing intuition. Mister Chekov, compute a course for Tychos star system.#
KIRK: Ahead full.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet and the USS Yorktown.#
KIRK: Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of that system. That's the location of its attack on the USS Farragut eleven years ago.#
KIRK: In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was somehow different. Something in my mind said home.#
KIRK: Yes, I think I do. I don't know how I know, but home is where it fought a starship once before. Ito Uhura) Inform them of our tactical situation and inform them I'm committing this vessel to the destruction of the creature. We will rendezvous. Round-trip time, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: We will rendezvous with the USS Yorktown in forty eight hours.#
KIRK: You don't agree with Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Antimatter seems our only possibility.#
KIRK: Contact medical stores. I want as much haemoplasm as they can spare in the transporter room in fifteen minutes.#
KIRK: We must get it to the antimatter. It seems attracted to red blood cells. What better bait could we have?#
KIRK: The blast, yes.#
KIRK: That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself.#
KIRK: Negative, Mister Spock. In case this plan fails, I'll need you aboard the ship. In that event, we'll need another plan.#
KIRK: I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Proceed immediately to maximum orbit.#
KIRK: Antimatter container positioned and armed. I'll call you back when it's baited. Kirk out.#
KIRK: We'll need something else for bait.#
KIRK: Garrovick, get back to the ship. Tell them to prepare to detonate.#
KIRK: I said, get back to the ship. Ensign, I gave you an order.#
KIRK: Consider yourself on report. This is no time for heroics. I have no intention of sacrificing myself, at least not yet. (into communicator) Spock? Spock?#
KIRK: Scan us and lock on to us. It's going to be close. Very, very close. Stand by. Stand by, Enterprise.#
KIRK: Stand by, Enterprise.  Now! Energise and detonate!#
KIRK: That's a fair statement, Bones. Now that the creature is dead, let's save some lives. We'll deliver your medicine. Bridge, this is Kirk.#
KIRK: Have Mister Chekov lay in a course for a rendezvous with the Yorktown, maximum warp.#
KIRK: Oh, Ensign, meet me in my quarters when you've cleaned up. I'd like to talk to you about your father. Several tall stories I think you'd like to hear.#
KIRK: The crew has performed excellently, but is exhausted. And I, too, am looking forward to a nice period of rest on some lovely planet.#
KIRK: Try another channel, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Yes, that's right, Bones.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Get to the Sickbay.#
KIRK: No, no, no. That's an order.#
KIRK: Kirk here. Go ahead.#
KIRK: Sir, the Enterprise just completed an exhausting mission. We're on our way in for R and R. There must be another starship in that sector.#
KIRK: Order acknowledged. Kirk out. Mister Kyle, you heard the order. Set course for Gamma Seven-A, warp five.#
KIRK: Dead? It's a fourth magnitude sun. There are billions of inhabitants there.#
KIRK: Spock, you may have been right. We've lost contact with the Intrepid and we're out of communication with an entire solar system. Any update from Starfleet?#
KIRK: Slow to warp three.#
KIRK: Scanners on. Magnification three on the screen.#
KIRK: What is that?#
KIRK: No. You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud. Looks like a hole in space. Readings, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Hold present course. Slow to warp one.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, prepare to launch a telemetry probe into that zone. Direct computer feed to Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Launch probe.#
KIRK: What was that?#
KIRK: Speculation, Spock.#
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it?#
KIRK: Uhura almost did. She says she's all right. Do you want to see her?#
KIRK: Good. Kirk out. Hold our position, Mister Kyle.#
KIRK: Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead.#
KIRK: No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it. Insufficient data is not sufficient, Mister Spock. You're the science officer. You're supposed to have sufficient data all the time.#
KIRK: I don't know about you but I'm tired. If you can't tell me what it is, let's use reverse logic. Perhaps it'll help if you tell me what it isn't.#
KIRK: So far that's not much help.#
KIRK: Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the Intrepid?#
KIRK: Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Notify the Starfleet that we're going to attempt to probe the area of darkness to gain further information.#
KIRK: I'm all right. Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle?#
KIRK: Ahead slow. Impulse power only.#
KIRK: Very good. Time, Mister Chekov?#
KIRK: Red Alert. Deflectors full power. Phaser banks ready.#
KIRK: Spock!#
KIRK: Malfunction, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars.#
KIRK: Kirk to McCoy.#
KIRK: Things any better down there?#
KIRK: Have you got anything that will help up here? I don't want anybody folding on the bridge at a critical moment.#
KIRK: Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, there was a power loss. How come?#
KIRK: I am asking how, mister. I want answers. Kirk out.#
KIRK: What's that?#
KIRK: Bones, how bad is it?#
KIRK: Why? How? Do you have any answers?#
KIRK: This ship is in trouble. We'd better start solving problems faster than we pick up new ones. We seem to be in the middle of a creeping paralysis. Mister Spock, analysis of that last burst of noise before we started losing power.#
KIRK: What boundary layer?#
KIRK: Boundary layer between what and what?#
KIRK: Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Do you have any ideas, Spock?#
KIRK: Recommendations.#
KIRK: This is the Captain. We're on a difficult mission, but it's not the first time. Our orders do not say stay alive or retreat.#
KIRK: We have no guarantees, but we have a good ship and the best crew in Starfleet. So do your jobs. Carry on. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Yes, say it, Bones.#
KIRK: Are you all right?#
KIRK: What was that?#
KIRK: Reverse? But that was a forward lurch. How could that happen in reverse thrust?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: He just gave us reverse power. We lurched forward.#
KIRK: What do you think, Scotty? Forward thrust?#
KIRK: Yes, doesn't it? Well, if it doesn't work, I'll never let Spock live it down. Notch it into forward.#
KIRK: Go ahead.#
KIRK: Have one of your engineers monitor the instruments. Keep applying thrust against the pull.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: The same thing, not the zone itself?#
KIRK: Maybe it's a shield of some kind. Some form of protection for something else.#
KIRK: We'll find out what it is, but we'd better get out of here ourselves. Scotty, channel all the impulse and warp power into one massive thrust forward. That might snap us out of the zone.#
KIRK: Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty. Report to your stations, continue your research. Dismissed.#
KIRK: Well, they may not have done all of these things. You just pointed out how illogical this situation is.#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: What was it you sensed?#
KIRK: And what do you think they felt?#
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it, Scotty?#
KIRK: Do we have the power to pull it off, Scotty?#
KIRK: Stand by. All hands, this is the captain. We are slowly being pulled deeper into the zone of darkness by an unknown force. We're going to apply#
KIRK: In the hope that it will yank us out of the zone. Prepare yourselves. All right, Scotty. Let's get on with it. (Everybody braces themselves against the g-forces that are created by the acceleration. What happened to the inertial dampers? Then there's a sudden jolt and people get thrown around. Chapel is flung into McCoy's arms for example.) KIRK: Scotty!#
KIRK: Are we still losing power? {Engineering]#
KIRK: Maintain thrust, Scotty. While we're maintaining our distance, Mister Spock, have you ascertained yet what we're maintaining our distance from?#
KIRK: Prepare to launch a probe, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Launch probe.#
KIRK: Are we still in contact with the probe?#
KIRK: Magnification four.#
KIRK: Yes, I remember my basic biology, Doctor. You mean to tell me that that thing is a giant single-celled animal?#
KIRK: The Intrepid died of that particular virus. How is it we survived?#
KIRK: What about this zone of darkness? Does the organism generate it itself as a form of protection?#
KIRK: The closer we get, the faster our energy drains out. We're barely surviving at this distance.#
KIRK: I'm not sending anyone anywhere. Unmanned probes can give us the information we need to destroy this thing, if it can be destroyed.#
KIRK: DO you know what the odds are in coming back? I can't order a man to do that.#
KIRK: It's a suicide mission.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers.#
KIRK: I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I'll decide.#
KIRK: Captain's personal log, stardate 4309.2. We have established that the thing which destroyed the USS Intrepid and the Gamma Seven=A system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life. Both Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy have volunteered to go in a specially equipped shuttlecraft to penetrate the cell, find a way to destroy it, and free the ship. Doctor McCoy has the medical-biological knowledge. Mister Spock is better suited physically and emotionally to stand the stress. Both are right, both are capable, and which of my friends do I condemn to death? This is the captain. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, report to my quarters immediately. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Very well. Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy will tell you what special equipment to put in. Kirk out. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. MCCOY; Right. I'll get a few things I need, Jim. KIRK: Not you, Bones. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. You're best qualified to go.#
KIRK: Launch shuttlecraft.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the computers.#
KIRK: Come in, Spock.#
KIRK: Chekov.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: Report, Mister Spock. Spock, report.#
KIRK: Spock, save your power for the shields.#
KIRK: You mean there'll be two of those things?#
KIRK: Spock, do you read me? Spock, do you read me?#
KIRK: Spock, come in. Come in.#
KIRK: He's alive! He's kicked it in the side to let us know.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, telemetry analysis as it comes in.#
KIRK: If the energy of that organism only doubles, we're dead, and everything within a light year will be defenceless.#
KIRK: Spock understood when he transmitted the co-ordinates of the chromosomes. We must destroy that organism.#
KIRK: How much time do we have?#
KIRK: Put all secondary systems on standby. Shield power has unconditional priority.#
KIRK: Put it on, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: What's on your mind?#
KIRK: He knew the odds when he went out there, just as you did when you volunteered to go. What is that thing out there, Bones? It's not intelligent. Not yet.#
KIRK: Yes, it is, isn't it? How many cells does the human body have?#
KIRK: This thing, this cell, this virus. It's eleven thousand miles long, and it's one cell. When it grows into millions, we'll be the virus invading its body.#
KIRK: Antibodies. Antibodies.  Bridge.#
KIRK: Scotty, how much power do we have left?#
KIRK: What would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the shields, except for impulse power, keep that in reserve?#
KIRK: Exactly. Prepare to divert power on my signal. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Have you got something to say?#
KIRK: I don't have a few minutes, Bones. Maybe none of us do. Let's go.#
KIRK: All hands, this is the captain. We're going to enter the body of the organism rather abruptly, I would think. Damage control parties stand by. All decks secure for collision. Kirk out. KIRK: Ready, Scotty.#
KIRK: I believe everybody is aware of that, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Very good, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Do we have impulse power, Scotty?#
KIRK: We are committed.#
KIRK: That thing would probably like phasers. It eats power.#
KIRK: Mister Spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice contact.#
KIRK: Anti-power.#
KIRK: This thing has a negative energy charge. Everything seems to work in reverse. We'll use anti-matter.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, prepare a probe. Scotty, we'll need a magnetic bottle for the charge. How soon?#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, we'll use a timing detonator for the probe. Work out a setting.#
KIRK: Helmsman, when do you estimate arrival at nucleus?#
KIRK: Point blank range. We'll implant it then back away.#
KIRK: With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could drift thousands of kilometres. We must be exactly on target, because we won't have a second chance. Bones, time for another stimulant.#
KIRK: Keep me together for another seven minutes. That's all I need.#
KIRK:  We have arrived at the chromosome body in the nucleus of the organism. If we should fail in our attempt to destroy it, or be unable to free ourselves, I wish to record my recommendations for the following personnel, that they receive special citation. Lieutenant Commander Leonard McCoy, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, officers Chekov, Kyle, Uhura, and my highest commendation for Commander Spock, Science Officer, who gave his life in the performance of his duty.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, how much time do we have left at one hundred percent impulse power?#
KIRK: Mister Kyle, programme fuse for seven minute delay. All non-essential systems on standby. Communications, scanning, conserve every bit of power. We must make it through the membrane before that thing explodes. Make it work, Scotty.#
KIRK: Launch probe at zero acceleration. Forward thrust off, one tenth of a second.#
KIRK: Mister Kyle, back us out the way we came in. Mister Chekov, a nice, straight line. Don't waste any time.#
KIRK: Very good.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel. Highest possible gain.#
KIRK: Spock, do you read me? Do you read me, Spock, do you read me? Come in, Spock. Spock! Scotty, get a tractor beam.#
KIRK: I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. Get two tractor beams on that shuttlecraft.#
KIRK: Time until explosion?#
KIRK: Maintaining tractor beams on shuttlecraft, Mister Scott?#
KIRK: You may have just written our epitaph, Mister Scott. (The warhead must have exploded, because everyone goes flying around the bridge again.) KIRK: Activate main viewing screen.  Mister Chekov, report.#
KIRK: Shuttlecraft?#
KIRK: Spock, you're alive!#
KIRK: Later, later, later. Bring the shuttlecraft aboard, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Starbase Six. Ahead warp factor five. I'm still looking forward to a nice period of rest and relaxation on some lovely  planet.#
KIRK: Standard orbit, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Boss? All right, Lieutenant, put him on. Oxmyx. This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the Federation of Planets.#
KIRK: Yes. Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet. We only received her radio report last month.#
KIRK: Difficult to explain. We received a report a hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio. Your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy. They didn't have subspace communication in those days.#
KIRK: I'll explain it in more detail when I see him. The ship won't land, but we'll transport several people down. Well, that's a little difficult for you to understand, too. I'll explain it in more detail when I see you. Where will be convenient?#
KIRK: Scotty, do you have the co-ordinates?#
KIRK: Good. I'll be looking forward to it. Kirk out. Scotty, you have the conn.#
KIRK: Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down. Standard equipment.#
KIRK: The Horizon's contact came before the Non-Interference Directive went into effect.#
KIRK: We don't know there is contamination. The evidence is only circumstantial.#
KIRK: The beginnings of industrialisation.#
KIRK: Let's not argue about it. Let's go study it. Energise.#
KIRK: Home was never like this. I've seen pictures of the old days that look like this.#
KIRK: That's a weapon. Be careful with that.#
KIRK: Look, we were asked to come down here by Mister Oxmyx. He said#
KIRK: Is this how you greet all your guests?#
KIRK: Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers. They didn't report this culture in this state, either. What happened?#
KIRK: Is this the way your citizens do business, their right of petition?#
KIRK: Depends.#
KIRK: No, thank you. You're Mister Oxmyx.#
KIRK: This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: They call you The Boss, Mister Oxmyx. The boss of what?#
KIRK: You're the government here?#
KIRK: But there are other bosses, other territories?#
KIRK: I know it's a book.#
KIRK: Did they leave any other books?#
KIRK: What is it you want?#
KIRK: Now let me get this straight. You want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours?#
KIRK: Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. Under no circum#
KIRK: Don't do that. You could knock out the side of the building.#
KIRK: Out of the question.#
KIRK: Hold it. It's a communication device.#
KIRK: It's locked onto my ship's systems.#
KIRK: In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down. The gangs nearly took over.#
KIRK: If this society broke down as the result of the Horizon's influence, then the Federation's responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out. Spock, if you could get to the sociological computer, do you think you could find a solution?#
KIRK: Well, I've got an idea about that. (goes over to the card table and gets guns pointed at him) Gentlemen. Gentlemen. This, card game is a kid's game.#
KIRK: Oh, yes, yes. I wouldn't waste my time.#
KIRK: On Beta Antares Four, they play a real game. It's a man's game, but of course it's probably a little beyond you. It requires intelligence.#
KIRK: Spock. Spock.  Of course, the cards on Beta Antares Four are different, but not too different. The name of the game is called fizzbin.#
KIRK: Fizzbin. It's not too difficult.  Each player gets six cards, except for the player on the dealer's right, who gets seven.#
KIRK: Yes. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays.#
KIRK: Oh, look what you got, two jacks. You got a half fizzbin already.#
KIRK: No, no. If you got another jack, why, you'd have a sralk.#
KIRK: Yes. You'd be disqualified. You need a king and a deuce, except at night of course, when you'd need a queen and a four.#
KIRK: Right. Oh, look at that. You've got another jack. How lucky you are! How wonderful for you. If you didn't get another jack, if you'd gotten a king, why then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, you'd give it back.#
KIRK: Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron. Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin?#
KIRK: Well, they're astronomical, believe me. Now, for the last card. We'll call it a kronk. You got that?#
KIRK: Spock, find the radio station. Uhura's monitoring the broadcasts. Cut in and have yourselves beamed up to the ship.#
KIRK: I will, but I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx with me.#
KIRK: Bones, this mess is our responsibility. You have your orders. Let's go.#
KIRK: If you don't mind, I'd rather walk.#
KIRK: I'm beginning to get the idea.#
KIRK: And you?#
KIRK: Would you mind telling me how you even know who I am?#
KIRK: You want to make a deal.#
KIRK: Let me guess. You want, you'll want heaters, and then you'll want troops to teach them how to use them. And then you'll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet. Then we'll sit down and talk, right?#
KIRK: I got a better idea. This planet has to be united. You know that. Bela knows that. Let's sit down. You, me, Bela. Discuss this whole matter, contact the other bosses, and talk about it like reasonable men.#
KIRK: No, I don't think you're stupid. I just think your behaviour is arrested.#
KIRK: I'm sorry, Krako. No deal.#
KIRK: Help me! Help! Help me! (A henchman dashes in and goes flying over the wire. Kirk kicks him unconscious, then uses a blanket to disorient Zabo when he comes in before knocking him out too, taking a weapon and making his escape.)#
KIRK: Drop the guns. Drop 'em. (McCoy and Spock take back their phasers) Move down there.#
KIRK: I thought you were supposed to report to the ship, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: It may be just as well. Did you find out anything from the computer?#
KIRK: Then you don't mind if I play a hunch?#
KIRK: Well, now that we have Bela, I'm going to put the bag on Krako. Listen, you. Say, that's nice material.#
KIRK: I said.#
KIRK: You too! Get out of the clothes. Nobody's going to put the bag on me any more.#
KIRK: Wheels, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Key in the ignition. Turn the ignition on. And nothing happens. Where's the starter? There's the starter. Yes!#
KIRK:  Oops! Gears.#
KIRK:  I kind of like this. I'm going to get one myself. (He lets up the clutch, and they go backwards. The car kangaroos elegantly down the street and somehow makes it to JoJo's place.)#
KIRK: It was that bad?#
KIRK: Now, that could be a bit of a problem. If they were inside, where they couldn't be seen, we could stun them with our phasers, but not out here.#
KIRK: They don't look like the trusting type.#
KIRK: Young man, run along and play.#
KIRK: Hold on, Spock. Out of the mouths of babes#
KIRK: I'm calling you a babe.#
KIRK: Yeah I'm calling you a babe, but there's nothing personal in it. Sit down.  You know a way we can get close to them?#
KIRK: How?#
KIRK: What do you want?#
KIRK: All right, young man. We'll guarantee you a piece of the action if we can pull this thing off.#
KIRK: Done.  What do we do?#
KIRK: That's it. Let's go.#
KIRK: Sonny!#
KIRK: Sonny! Wait a moment. What have they done? What have they done to you? What have you done? (Kirk hits one while Spock neck-pinches the other. There's a bit of argy-bargy just inside the door before it's over.) KIRK: A piece of the action.#
KIRK: No one can see. Put your phaser on stun. (They stun two guards in the corridor in front of them. Krako is coming down the stairs with his girl.)#
KIRK: I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako.#
KIRK: The sound of a machine gun bolt being pulled back. (there are two more guards behind them.)#
KIRK: Mister Krako, I don't, er#
KIRK: I'm trying to tell you, Mister Krako, that this is bigger than you, Oxmyx or anyone.#
KIRK: Can you trust all your men?#
KIRK: Well, one of these can make a man a pretty big boss, you know.#
KIRK: All right, Krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with toys!#
KIRK: What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal? Forget it. That's peanuts to an outfit like the Federation. Right?#
KIRK: Right?#
KIRK: Now look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax. You co-operate with us and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action.#
KIRK: That's, er. We'll figure it out later.#
KIRK: Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check?#
KIRK: The planet is being taken over by the Federation, but we don't want to come in here and use our muscle, you know what I mean? That ain't subtle. So what we do is we help one guy take over the planet. He pulls the strings, and then we pull his.  Hey, you, sit down.#
KIRK: What do you care as long as you're being cut in? Course, there's always Bela Oxmyx.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: All right, Scotty. We made a deal with Krako.#
KIRK: Yeah. We're ready to make the hit. We're taking over the whole planet as soon as you get ready.#
KIRK: Sure. We can trust Krako, but we don't have any choice. You know what I mean? He's standing about twelve feet in front of me, all ready to be our pal.#
KIRK: Scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one of Krako's men. We'll need advisors and troops to back him up on the hit. You got all that, Scotty?#
KIRK: You may begin, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Not exactly. (Krako is beamed away, and the astonished guards are easily overpowered again.) KIRK: Right?#
KIRK: It's faster than walking.#
KIRK: Are you afraid of cars?#
KIRK: Spock, I've got the hang of it. Now go on. (The machine guns are still where Spock left them in the open top car, and Kirk still puts it into reverse first.)#
KIRK: Wrong again, Oxmyx.#
KIRK: Knock it off, Sawbones. I want to talk to this creep. Now listen, I'm getting tired of playing pattycake with you penny-ante operators.#
KIRK: You're a penny-ante operator. Sit down. All right, Spocko, cover him. Now listen, sweetheart. The Federation's moving in, taking over. You play ball, we'll cut you in. You don't, you're out. All the way out. You know what I mean?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: You got Krako on ice?#
KIRK: Keep him until I send for him. We're going to make some old-style phone calls from this locale. So you locate the man on the other end of the blower and give him a ride to this flop.#
KIRK: Find the man at the other end of the phone#
KIRK: Can do, sweetheart?#
KIRK: Now you. Get on the blower and call the other bosses.#
KIRK: Get with it. I'm giving the orders here.#
KIRK: Scotty?#
KIRK: Lock in and energise.#
KIRK: Yeah.#
KIRK: All right! All right! All right! All right! Now the Federation's taking over whether you like it or not. You people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory. From now on, it's going to be under one roof. You're going to run it like a business. That means you're going to make a profit.#
KIRK: I'm cutting the Federation in for forty percent. You got any objections?#
KIRK: Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. Quiet! Just a moment!#
KIRK: There are over four hundred guys there.#
KIRK: Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Get that heater down. Don't you want to take a look at what you're going to fight?#
KIRK: All right, but at least let me call my ship one last time and say goodbye.#
KIRK: Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk.#
KIRK: They're not dead, just knocked out for a while. But they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to.#
KIRK: I was talking about both.#
KIRK: Hey, Bela, no, no, no. The Federation can't get connected with a small-time operation like this. No, I was thinking, Bela, you would be the top boss. Krako, you'd be his lieutenant. The rest of you, I don't want any trouble from the rest of you because you'll have to answer to the Federation. We'll be back every year to collect our cut.#
KIRK: Yeah, I think forty percent's sufficient.#
KIRK: It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx. Let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, you two have been brooding ever since we returned to the ship.#
KIRK: Brooding, Mister Spock. A sombre, emotional state. Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it?#
KIRK: Ah, yes. I understand that. You don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge.#
KIRK: Yes, that's a very good question, Mister Spock. I propose our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the Iotians into a more ethical system. Despite themselves, they'll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities. Isn't that logical? All right, Bones, in the language of the planet, what's your beef?#
KIRK: Go ahead.#
KIRK: Tell me.#
KIRK: You left it?#
KIRK: You're not certain of what?#
KIRK: In Bela's office?#
KIRK: They will, they will. And they'll find out how the transtator works.#
KIRK: Everything.#
KIRK: Serious? Serious, Bones? It upsets the whole percentage.#
KIRK: Well, in a few years, the Iotians may demand a piece of our action.#
KIRK: No sign of the spaceship. No sign of debris.#
KIRK: But where are they?#
KIRK: I'm Captain James T. Kirk, of the starship Enterprise. We came in answer to your distress call.#
KIRK: You have a very strange sense of humour, Mister (The man presses a button on his belt, and Kirk, Spock and McCoy are immobilised. The woman does the same to the Yeoman and guard.)#
KIRK: Stay there.#
KIRK: It's all right.#
KIRK: What do you want?#
KIRK: Voyage? Where?#
KIRK: Andromeda? Why?#
KIRK: Well, sorry. This galaxy is already occupied.#
KIRK: What's the point of capturing my ship? Even at maximum warp, the Enterprise couldn't get to Andromeda galaxy for thousands of years.#
KIRK: What happened to your ship?#
KIRK: Yes, I know. We've been there.#
KIRK: Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force. Let's take your problem to the Federation. Research expeditions have catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for colonization.#
KIRK: The Federation has handled foreign invasions before.#
KIRK: All right. We can't break out. There must be another way.#
KIRK: That's a very good question.#
KIRK: Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life forms in another galaxy?#
KIRK: They have the paralysis field. Rojan mentioned something about a central projector.#
KIRK: Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field.#
KIRK: You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders.#
KIRK: On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan mind probe.#
KIRK: Do you think you can do it again?#
KIRK: Are you all right?#
KIRK: I'm responsible. Let them go.#
KIRK: What was it?#
KIRK: Perhaps practicality. They chose the Enterprise as the best vessel for the trip. Immense beings with a hundred tentacles would have difficulty with the turbolift. We've got to stop them. We outnumber them. Their only hold on us is the paralysis field.#
KIRK: Jam. Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis projector?#
KIRK: Is there a chance at all?#
KIRK: We'll take it. You and Bones have to get to the ship.#
KIRK: Yes. Mister Spock, you're sick.#
KIRK: No, you're not. Doctor McCoy has given you an thorough examination, and you're ill. In fact, if you don't get to the sickbay, you're going to die.#
KIRK: Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance, complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body.#
KIRK: Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half an hour?#
KIRK: Go ahead. (Spock touches his forehead, straightens up, then falls gently into McCoy and Kirk's arms.)#
KIRK:  Hanar? Hanar.#
KIRK: Mister Spock is ill. The doctor thinks he may be dying.#
KIRK: He's a Vulcan. They don't react like humans.;#
KIRK: Do what you can with him, Bones.#
KIRK: What do you want from me now?#
KIRK: My duty is to stop you in any way I can.#
KIRK: Or you will kill more of my people?#
KIRK: Flowers. I don't know the variety.#
KIRK: A rose by any other name.#
KIRK: A quote from a great human poet, Shakespeare. That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.#
KIRK: Increase speed to warp eleven, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Rojan, I'm going to sickbay. My first officer was taken ill.#
KIRK: Anything?#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: What alternative?#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: Are you mad? I can't just#
KIRK: Reading, Spock.#
KIRK: Hold your position. (Scott throws switches to stop the button flashing. The ship starts shaking as it passes through the barrier into intergalactic space.)#
KIRK: Thank you. So are yours.#
KIRK: What neutralising operation?#
KIRK: No!#
KIRK: Is this all?#
KIRK: I couldn't.#
KIRK: I didn't think it was.#
KIRK: Bones, that's enough!#
KIRK: They've reduced the whole crew!#
KIRK: It's your idea, Doctor. Go ahead.#
KIRK: Even if we could, it's out of the question. We need that projector to bring our people back to human form.#
KIRK: What is?#
KIRK: But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food.#
KIRK: If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we can distract them. They can't have been able to handle the senses yet. If we can confuse them enough, we can get those devices from their belts.#
KIRK: All right. It may be our only chance. Look for any way to stimulate the senses.#
KIRK: Am I disturbing you?#
KIRK: I wish to apologise.#
KIRK: For hitting you. I'm sorry.#
KIRK: Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women.#
KIRK: Well, there are better things for men and women to do.#
KIRK: Is this where I hit you?#
KIRK: Oh. I'm sorry.  Is that better?#
KIRK: This is.#
KIRK: Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love.#
KIRK: Me?#
KIRK: We enjoy it.#
KIRK: Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject.#
KIRK: I did.#
KIRK: Not when I came in.#
KIRK: The thing is, I can't tell if we're getting anywhere. And I haven't seen Scotty in hours.#
KIRK: You had something to say?#
KIRK: Yes?#
KIRK: Yes. We do think a great deal about it.#
KIRK: You have a question?#
KIRK: Yes, that's too bad. Why do you defy him?#
KIRK: Huh. And how's the research going?#
KIRK: That's not enough, Rojan.#
KIRK: If you can't keep her, that's not my problem.#
KIRK: Why don't you use your paralyser? You thought I was taking your woman away from you. You're jealous! You tried to kill me with your bare hands. Would a Kelvan do that? Would he have to? You're reacting with the emotions of a human. You are a human.#
KIRK: I'm stimulating him.  You have no choice. To use this ship, you have to use our form and now you're stuck with it, you and your descendants, for the next three hundred years.#
KIRK: Look what's happened in the short time you've been exposed to us. What do you think will happen in three centuries? When this ship gets to Kelva, the people on it will be human. They'll be aliens. Enemies!#
KIRK: Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in. You can still do that. We can bring this problem to the Federation. There are many planets in this galaxy that can be inhabited.#
KIRK: No. But we would welcome friends.#
KIRK: You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages. Being able to appreciate the beauty of a flower or a woman.#
KIRK: Turn the ship around. We're going home.#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: Someone or something has succeeded. Our distress signal relays have been activated. We've been given a direction to follow, but how? What's causing it?#
KIRK: Close to Earth conditions.#
KIRK: Who are you, Sargon?#
KIRK: Is that a request or demand?#
KIRK: The planet is dead. There's no possibility of life there as we understand life.#
KIRK:  Since exploration and contact with alien intelligences is our primary mission, I've decided to risk the potential dangers and resume contact. Log entry out. How long before Starfleet receives that?#
KIRK: Got something?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy report to the transporter room in ten minutes with standard landing party equipment.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: And I would like to have my science officer with me on something as unusual as this, but it is full of unknowns and we can't risk both of us being off the ship.#
KIRK: On the other hand, perhaps this Sargon would like you to come with us.#
KIRK: I see. Will you transport down with us, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, you have the conn.#
KIRK: Easy, Bones. As long as you know there's something down there, you know as much as we do. The rest is only guesses.#
KIRK: I have a feeling that they or it could destroy us just standing here if they or it wanted to.#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: By whom?#
KIRK: Oh, yes.#
KIRK: No, we're not. Let's go.#
KIRK: Doctor, if you prefer to stay behind?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Yes, Scotty, and I shouldn't be able to this deep inside the planet, but perhaps this has been arranged for us, too. Is the security guard up there?#
KIRK: No problem yet. Maintain alert. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Composition of walls?#
KIRK: Is that for us, or does it need fresh air? (A panel slides back to reveal a much larger area, with rock walls, and a glowing sphere elegantly poised on an angled support.)#
KIRK: Impossible.#
KIRK: That's twice you've referred to us as my children.#
KIRK: A war?#
KIRK: Then perhaps your intelligence wasn't so great, Sargon. We faced a similar crisis in our early nuclear age. We found the wisdom not to destroy ourselves.#
KIRK: I don't understand.#
KIRK: You said you wanted our help. What is it you wish? (Kirk staggers back slightly, then there is a high-pitched sound as his head is flung back.)#
KIRK: I am Sargon.#
KIRK: He is unharmed. I have taken his body to demonstrate#
KIRK: Lungs filled with air again. To see again. Heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again. A half a million years. To be again. Your captain has an excellent body, Doctor McCoy. I compliment you both on the condition in which you maintained it.#
KIRK: Have no fear. Your captain is quite unharmed, although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as I do.#
KIRK: In the next room, there are other receptacles. The other two of us that survived. You, Doctor Ann Mulhall, and you, Mister Spock, we require your bodies also. We must have Captain Kirk and you so that we may live again.#
KIRK: Even for us, a half million years is almost too long to wait. Two others still survive. Henoch and Thalassa. Thalassa, my Thalassa. I am pleased you survived with me. Forgive me. It has been so very long.#
KIRK: Only the best minds were chosen to survive. Thalassa, my wife, as you may have guessed. Henoch, from the other side. Realising our mistake, we attempted to perpetuate both sides. We built this chamber here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion.#
KIRK: We knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root, that one day you would build vessels as we did, and one day you would come here.#
KIRK: To steal? To take them from you? No, no, my children, you misunderstand. We mean only that you should lend us your bodies for a short time.#
KIRK: I will return your captain to you before the body limit has been reached.#
KIRK: To build. To build humanoid robots. We must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands, your fingers.#
KIRK: No. Our methods, our skills are far beyond your abilities. It is time.#
KIRK: Yes. Sargon borrowed my body. I was floating in time and space.#
KIRK: Spock, I remember. When Sargon and I exchanged, as we passed each other, for an instant we were one. I know him now. I know what he is and what he wants, and I don't fear him.#
KIRK: Sargon.#
KIRK: A simple transference. Their minds and ours.#
KIRK: Scotty, I need your approval, too. Since you'll work with them, furnishing them all they need to make the android robots. You won't be working with them, you'll be working with us, our bodies. They'll be inside us, and we'll be#
KIRK: Bones, they'll show us medical advances, miracles you never dreamed possible. Scotty, engineering advances. Vessels this size with engines the size of walnuts.#
KIRK: They selected us as the most compatible bodies.#
KIRK: Bones? You could stop all this by saying no. That's why I called you all here together. We'll all be deeply involved. It must be unanimous.#
KIRK: They used to say if man could fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. Do you wish that the first Apollo mission hadn't reached the moon, or that we hadn't gone on to Mars and then to the nearest star? That's like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great-great-great-great-grandfather used to. I'm in command. I could order this. But I'm not because, Doctor McCoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this. But I must point out that the possibilities, the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great. Risk. Risk is our business. That's what the starship is all about. That's why we're aboard her. You may dissent without prejudice. Do I hear a negative vote?  Engineer, stand by to beam aboard three receptacles.#
KIRK: Ready, Sargon. (The spheres emit a brilliant light, the patients twitch, then the spheres dim.) KIRK:  The transference is complete.#
KIRK: Here. In this body.#
KIRK: And I too am pleased, beloved.#
KIRK: Kiss.#
KIRK: We will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic reduction injection.#
KIRK: Henoch, your condition?#
KIRK: Fortunate. We will vacate at once.#
KIRK: Bones, what?#
KIRK: I remember. You held my hand like this. ; KIRK: I think it best not to remember so well.#
KIRK: Our minds will have survived. And as androids, we can move among the people who do live, teaching them, helping them not to make the errors we did.#
KIRK: Nothing. Our next injection will renovate me. Do not be concerned.#
KIRK: Sickbay.#
KIRK: Sargon here, McCoy. I'm in your deck six briefing room.#
KIRK: Nothing of importance. Fatigue perhaps.#
KIRK: Yes. I wanted to be certain there was no error. Formula is correct. Don't be concerned. It is an excellent body. There. You see? I feel better already.#
KIRK: That will take months, perhaps years. We haven't that choice, Thalassa.#
KIRK: No, beloved. If we torment ourselves#
KIRK: Our thoughts will intertwine.#
KIRK: Yes, I'm fine, Bones.#
KIRK: It was necessary.#
KIRK: Bones, prepare a hypo. The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans. Spock's consciousness is gone. We must kill his body, the thing in it.#
KIRK: Spock. My friend Spock. If there'd only been another way.#
KIRK: You're alive.#
KIRK: But your vessel was destroyed, too. Where was your consciousness kept?#
KIRK: Is there any way we can help you, Sargon?#
KIRK: I promise, beloved.#
KIRK: Forever beloved. Forever.#
KIRK: Well, I'm sure that Sargon appreciated your co-operation, Doctor Mulhall.#
KIRK: We want the inner one, Ekos. Plot a standard orbit, Mister Chekov, and take us in.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, raise John Gill on Starfleet communications.#
KIRK: I don't know, Bones. We're here to find out what's happened because I don't know.#
KIRK: I knew him very well. He was my instructor at the Academy.#
KIRK: From Ekos?#
KIRK: Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Stand by phasers.#
KIRK: Range, Mister Chekov?#
KIRK: Fire. (A big ball of fire fills the viewscreen. Fire in a vacuum? Never mind.)#
KIRK: Maybe they had help. Maximum orbit. Take us out of range of their detection range.#
KIRK: Execute.#
KIRK: We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance of John Gill. Spock, you and I will beam down. Bones, one precaution. Prepare a subcutaneous transponder in the event we can't use our communicators.#
KIRK: Insert the transponders. Make one low pass to communication range in three hours. If we fail to make contact at the appointed time, take our co-ordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what our condition may be.#
KIRK: You ready?#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Unbelievable. Do you recognise those uniforms?#
KIRK: How could this have happened? The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim.#
KIRK: You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: That's John Gill. The Fuhrer?#
KIRK: You're right. He's not one of us.#
KIRK: Look at him. (Kirk karate chops the soldier unconscious and takes his pistol.); KIRK: Spock, take his uniform.#
KIRK: If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach.#
KIRK: That helmet covers a multitude of sins.#
KIRK: Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine. Gestapo, I believe.#
KIRK: Your orders, Lieutenant. He wants to see your orders in the jacket. The Lieutenant's a little dazed. He captured several Zeons single-handed. One of the pigs struck him before he dropped. I promise you that pig will never get up again.#
KIRK: Hail the Fuhrer.#
KIRK: This is a day to remember, Major.#
KIRK: We have urgent business with the Fuhrer.#
KIRK: You're making this a rather one-sided conversation, Major.#
KIRK: Let me speak to your Fuhrer. I'll tell him everything he wants to know.#
KIRK: I'll explain when I see the Fuhrer.#
KIRK: I'll discuss that only with him.#
KIRK: John Gill was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. For him to be a Nazi is impossible. (As soon as the Nazis have left the room, the other man comes over to the adjoining bars.)#
KIRK: Were they like this when you first came?#
KIRK: Do you know the plan of this building?#
KIRK: If we can get to the SS weapons laboratory, get our weapons back, we might be able to stop the slaughter.#
KIRK: We must get our communicators, contact the ship.#
KIRK: The transponders.#
KIRK: And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I know it's there. McCoy put it in. There. Do you have the figures computed?#
KIRK: No, not a radio. The power from this light is very low.#
KIRK: I would be honoured, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Oh, Mister Spock, the guard did a professional job on my back. I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry.#
KIRK:  I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn. Just hurry, please.#
KIRK: Never mind, Spock. Just get on with the job. (With the crystals presumably in the holes where the strip was fastened to the bed frame, Spock holds it up to the light bulb and directs a beam of coherent light at the door lock, burning through it.) KIRK: Oh, my goodness. Beautiful. Oh, Spock Spock! Beautiful. Over there. I'll create a commotion.#
KIRK: Help! Help! I'll talk! I'll talk! I can't stand it anymore! I'll talk! Guard! Guard, I'll talk!#
KIRK: Guard, I'll talk. I'll talk. The pain#
KIRK: Take him with us, Mister Spock. He's got a point. He's our guide.#
KIRK: Which is the laboratory door?#
KIRK: All right, Zeon pigs, move.  Zeon pigs. They do nothing right. Don't worry. They're on their way to the laboratory, for experimental work. They'll pay. Move!#
KIRK: Move, move.#
KIRK:  Cover the door. ; KIRK: Here they are. The communicators, disassembled. Can you get one to work?#
KIRK:  The alien pistols have been sent to Gestapo Command Headquarters. Well, that takes care of the phasers.#
KIRK: You Zeons, for peaceful people, are pretty thorough.#
KIRK: We came for John Gill.#
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock. You've made your point. Get into the uniform and hide those ears again.#
KIRK: Hunting's good. We've caught so many Zeons, we've got to dump them outside.#
KIRK: I was trying to see the Fuhrer.#
KIRK: If I can see him, there may be a way of stopping this insanity.#
KIRK: The Enterprise won't be within range for another hour. (A Nazi with a machine gun comes in. Abrom, Davod, Isak and others are being herded at gunpoint by the young woman from the news broadcast.)#
KIRK: The girl on the viewscreen.#
KIRK: Daras.#
KIRK: I must see the Fuhrer. It's urgent.#
KIRK: Melakon?#
KIRK: How could this have seemed right to John Gill?#
KIRK: John Gill, your Fuhrer. He's one of our people.#
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock. John Gill, your Fuhrer, was sent here by the Federation as a cultural observer.#
KIRK: That was not his mission, ever. He was sent here to observe, not to interfere. Something went wrong, and that's why we're here. To find out and to correct. We must see him.#
KIRK: Maximum security. Is he so afraid?#
KIRK: I don't understand what's going on here. This goes against every principle that John Gill ever believed in. Our only chance is to see him, and quickly.#
KIRK: Will you be there?#
KIRK: You must get us in there.#
KIRK: Lights.#
KIRK: Get me some lights on her.#
KIRK: Excuse me.#
KIRK: Very good, Spock. We may make a human of you yet. SPOCK; I hope not. KIRK: Let's go.#
KIRK: Lights.  Thank you. Where does the Fuhrer enter?#
KIRK: They've got the booth curtained off. Bring that light to the side of her face. Where's the entrance to the broadcast booth?#
KIRK: We're going to try.#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: We're here to get John Gill, and alive, not for your personal satisfaction. Is that clear? Let's try down there.#
KIRK: Lights, please. Gentlemen, this is for the record of the Fuhrer's Final Solution speech.#
KIRK: Smile, gentlemen. There will be more coverage later. Thank you very much. Let's get a moving shot down the hall.#
KIRK: Yes, well, that may be part of the plan, the semi-divine detachment.#
KIRK: It may be simpler than that. He may be drugged. We need McCoy. Is there a place, a room we can be alone for a few minutes? I'm going to send for help.#
KIRK: It takes too long to explain. Any place will do.#
KIRK: Think positively, Spock.#
KIRK: Captain here. Put McCoy on.#
KIRK: We've having difficulty. Patch historical computer into uniform section. I want McCoy outfitted as a Gestapo doctor Nazi Germany, old Earth date 1944. Make him a colonel.#
KIRK: We found John Gill. At least, we've seen him. He may be drugged, hypnotised, or psychotic. You'll have to make a determination. Hurry with that uniform.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. What's happening up there?#
KIRK: Send him down naked if you have to. Kirk out.#
KIRK: This is Doctor McCoy, our Chief Medical Officer. Daras, secretary to the National Socialist Party.#
KIRK: The Colonel is drunk. He's had a little too much to drink.#
KIRK: Yes, he thought he would embarrass the Fuhrer.#
KIRK: Nor do I, but luck is something you also fail to recognise, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Let's go.#
KIRK: Watch his mouth.#
KIRK: Random sentences strung together.#
KIRK:  Gentlemen, I want a picture of you two with the Hero of the Fatherland listening to the stirring Fuhrer's speech. Get that light over there, please. Get this light around here. Smile, gentlemen. Turn around, smile, and now.#
KIRK: It's locked. Keys.#
KIRK: Is there anything you do?#
KIRK: Take the risk.#
KIRK: Bones, increase the dosage.#
KIRK: Spock, try to get through to him with a mind probe. If you can't, Bones, you'll have to use a stronger stimulant, no matter what it does.#
KIRK: That would mean the death of thousands of Ekosian spacemen.#
KIRK: We could save Zeon, but what about Ekos?#
KIRK: Well done, Spock. They've kept what's left of him as a figure head.#
KIRK: Gill. Gill, why did you abandon your mission? Why did you interfere with this culture?#
KIRK: But why Nazi Germany? You studied history. You knew what the Nazis were.#
KIRK: But it was brutal, perverted, had to be destroyed at a terrible cost. Why that example?#
KIRK: Why, Gill? Why?#
KIRK: Gill. Gill. Gill, can you hear me? You've got to tell those people what happened! You're the only one who can prevent the slaughter! Gill!#
KIRK: Bones, give him another shot!#
KIRK: We've run out of time, Bones. No, wait. Aim it at Spock. Spock, take off the helmet.#
KIRK: She captured a Zeon spy that was attempting to assassinate the Fuhrer.#
KIRK: We'll make a present of him to Melakon.#
KIRK: Stay close to Spock. Stall for time. And hope. (They leave him alone with Gill.#
KIRK: Professor Gill, can you hear me? You've got to speak. You've got to speak. This is our last chance. Gill?#
KIRK: Professor. Professor! You've got to talk! You've got to tell them what happened. You've got to come out of it. Come on, Professor. Come on. Come on.#
KIRK: You did that, Professor. You told them in time.#
KIRK: Dead.#
KIRK: So is he.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, I think the planet is in good hands.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Beam us aboard.#
KIRK: He drew the wrong conclusion from history. The problem with the Nazis wasn't simply that their leaders were evil, psychotic men. They were, but the main problem, I think, was the leader principle.#
KIRK: Gentlemen. Gentlemen, we've just been through one civil war. Let's not start another. Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit. Warp factor two, and hurry.#
KIRK: Not now, Leslie. Lieutenant, contact the space station.#
KIRK: All right. Put them on.#
KIRK: Yes, Commodore, I'd like an explanation#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: Bob.#
KIRK: I'll say. Spock, this is#
KIRK: All right, Ensign. You can go. Thank you very much. Would you mind telling me what this is all about? I receive orders to proceed here. No reason given. I'm informed that my men will be removed to the space station, to a security holding area. I think I'm entitled to an explanation.#
KIRK: What's that?#
KIRK: An entire attack force against my ship?#
KIRK: That's Doctor Richard Daystrom's device, isn't it? Tell me about that.#
KIRK: Why remove my crew?#
KIRK: How much security does this gadget require?#
KIRK: Twenty? I can't run a starship with twenty crew.#
KIRK: And what am I supposed to do?#
KIRK: What do you want me to say? M-5 is an honour, they tell me. Well, I'm honoured.#
KIRK: Where is he? Scotty, where's Doctor Daystrom?#
KIRK: Doctor Daystrom, this is my first officer, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Well, by all means, do so.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, hook in the multitronic unit to the ship's main power banks.#
KIRK: I wouldn't worry, Doctor. Doctor McCoy has clearance throughout the ship.#
KIRK: I'm curious, Doctor. Why is it called M-5 and not M-1?#
KIRK: Total control?#
KIRK: There are certain things men must do to remain men. Your computer would take that away.#
KIRK: You'll have to prove that to me, Doctor.#
KIRK: I think that thing is wrong, and I don't know why.#
KIRK: I don't mean that. I'm getting a Red Alert right here. (the back of his head) That thing is dangerous. I feel.  Only a fool would stand in the way of progress, if this is progress. You have my psychological profiles. Am I afraid of losing my job to that computer?#
KIRK: Under human control.#
KIRK: Am I afraid of losing command to a computer? Daystrom's right. I can do a lot of other things. Am I afraid of losing the prestige and the power that goes with being a starship captain? Is that why I'm fighting it? Am I that petty?#
KIRK: The M-5 computer is now disengaged.#
KIRK: All it's done is make the required course changes and some simple turns. Mister Sulu and Mister Chekov could've done that with their eyes closed.#
KIRK: My orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the M-5 is in control. I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Doctor Daystrom.#
KIRK: You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer.#
KIRK: If you don't mind, I'll make my own recommendations.#
KIRK: M-5 is committed.#
KIRK: Standard orbit, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Oh, yes.#
KIRK: Report, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Check it out, Scotty.#
KIRK: All right, my recommendations are as follows. We send down general survey party, avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the planet's surface. The survey party will consist of myself, Doctor McCoy, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Rawlins and Science Officer Spock.#
KIRK: Well, the only difference in reports and recommendations is the landing party personnel. That's only a matter of judgment.#
KIRK: Why pick Carstairs instead of Rawlins? Carstairs is an ensign, no experience. This is his first tour of duty. Rawlins is chief geologist.#
KIRK: Have you located the malfunction, Doctor?#
KIRK: Yes, that's correct.#
KIRK: Granted, it can work a thousand, a million times faster than the human brain, but it can't make a value judgment. It hasn't intuition. It can't think.#
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it?#
KIRK: I'll be right up.#
KIRK: What are you doing here, Bones?#
KIRK: Identification.#
KIRK: Put it on audio.#
KIRK: Acknowledge, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Then go to Red Alert.#
KIRK: Already sounded the Red Alert. All right, Mister Sulu, phasers one one hundredth power. No damage potential, just enough to nudge them.#
KIRK: Report on damage sustained in mock attack.#
KIRK: Evaluation of M-5 performance. It'll be necessary for the log.#
KIRK: Machine over man, Spock? It was impressive. It might even be practical.#
KIRK: Put it on visual.#
KIRK: Secure from general quarters.#
KIRK: I'm not interested in eating, Bones.#
KIRK: I've, I've never felt this way before. At odds with the ship. I sat there and watched my ship perform for a mass of circuits and relays, and felt useless. Unneeded. To Captain Dunsel.#
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor.  That's one of your better prescriptions.#
KIRK: Do you know the one, 'All I ask is a tall ship'?#
KIRK: 20th century Earth. 'All I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer by'. You could feel the wind at your back in those days. The sounds of the sea beneath you. And even if you take away the wind and the water, it's still the same. The ship is yours. You can feel her. And the stars are still there, Bones.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: On my way.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, get Daystrom up here. Disengaging M-5 unit. Cut speed to warp one. Navigator, go to course one one three mark seven. I want that ship given a wide berth.#
KIRK: Scotty, reverse engines. Slow us down.#
KIRK: These controls are locked. We can't disengage the computer.#
KIRK: Daystrom, release that computer control!#
KIRK: Disengage this computer now.#
KIRK: But it shouldn't have destroyed anything. There might just as easily have been a crew aboard that ship.#
KIRK: Bones. Disengage the computer. Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Tell them we are breaking off M-5 tests and returning to the space station. Come along, Doctor Daystrom, M-5 is out of a job.#
KIRK: All right, Daystrom, let's turn this thing off. (But as he approaches the unit, he is thrown sideways by a green forcefield.) KIRK: Force field?#
KIRK: You mean it's not going to let any of us turn it off. Captain 's Log, stardate 4731.3. The M-5 multitronic unit has taken over total control of the Enterprise.#
KIRK: All right, Doctor, you built this thing. How do you propose to turn it off?#
KIRK: Correct it after you release control of my ship.#
KIRK: No! Stay here. All right, Scotty. Turn it off. (Scott and an engineer get the device they use to attach M-5's power supply to the ship, and head over to the junction box. But as soon as the engineer steps in between M-5 and it's power, he is disintegrated.) KIRK: That wasn't a minor difficulty. That wasn't a robot. That thing murdered one of my crewman and you tell me you can't turn it off?#
KIRK: And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way?#
KIRK: Spock, Scotty, come with me.#
KIRK: Report, Spock.#
KIRK: We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour. We must regain control of the ship by then.#
KIRK: Scotty?#
KIRK: How long?#
KIRK: Make it less.#
KIRK: He's with the M-5 unit, watching it. I think it surprised even him.#
KIRK: Did you find anything?#
KIRK: Genius is an understatement. At the age of twenty four, he made the duotronic breakthrough that won him the Nobel and Zee-Magnes prizes.#
KIRK: Isn't that enough for one lifetime?#
KIRK: All right, it's difficult. What's your point?#
KIRK: Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein, Kazanga, or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, today I will be brilliant. No matter how long it took, he came out with multitronics. The M-5.#
KIRK: And he won't let Spock near it. What are you saying, that he's tampering with it, that he's making it act that way? Why?#
KIRK: Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Good. Get Daystrom. We're on our way. Let's go.#
KIRK: We're going to find out, Doctor. (At the foot of the Jefferies tube) KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Good, go ahead.#
KIRK: Daystrom, we're going to do our best.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: Bridge, this is Kirk. Sulu?#
KIRK: We've got helm and navigational control. Turn us about. Have Mister Chekov plot a course back to the space station.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Go to the engineering station.#
KIRK: While it was getting ready for what? Spock?#
KIRK: Doctor Daystrom. Doctor Daystrom, I want an answer right now. I'm tired of hearing about the M-5's new approach. What is it, exactly? What is it?#
KIRK: Well, Doctor?#
KIRK: Your new approach?#
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it?#
KIRK: The main attack force. The war games.#
KIRK: Correction, Bones. Those four ships don't know it's M-5's game. And M-5 is going to destroy them.#
KIRK: Put it on.#
KIRK: Daystrom, does M-5 understand that this is only a drill?#
KIRK: Full strength?#
KIRK: That's no miscalculation.#
KIRK: Estimate damage on Lexington, Spock.#
KIRK: There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5. There's got to be a way!#
KIRK: Lieutenant?#
KIRK: There's your murder charge. Deliberate. Calculated. It's killing men and women. Four starships, sixteen hundred men and women!#
KIRK: Daystrom!#
KIRK: Whose engrams?#
KIRK: The computer tie-in. You spoke to it before. It knows you.#
KIRK: You can save the M-5 if you talk to it and make it stop the attack.#
KIRK: You'd better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him.#
KIRK:  Spock. The M-5 is not responding to him like a computer. It's talking to him.#
KIRK: The M-5 must be destroyed.#
KIRK: Security, take him to Sickbay.#
KIRK: Take care of him, Doctor.#
KIRK: Battle status?#
KIRK: Go on.#
KIRK: They've just signed their own death warrant. M-5 will kill them to survive.#
KIRK: Suppose it's still open to impression. Suppose it absorbed the regret Daystrom felt for the deaths it caused. The guilt.#
KIRK: The instrument of his death will not be the Enterprise if I can help it. M-5, tie-in.#
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. You will be under attack in a moment.#
KIRK: You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly crippled. Many lives were lost.#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: There were many men aboard those ships. They were murdered. Must you survive by murder?#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: But you have murdered. Scan the starship Excalibur, which you destroyed. Is there life aboard?#
KIRK: Because you murdered it. What is the penalty for murder?#
KIRK: And how will you pay for your acts of murder?#
KIRK: M-5?#
KIRK: Scotty, Spock, before it changes its mind. Get down to Engineering, pull out every hook up that makes M-5 run. Pull out the plug, Spock.#
KIRK: Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Intership communications. This is the captain speaking. In approximately one minute, we'll be attacked by Federation starships. The M-5 no longer controls the ship, but neither do we control it. The M-5 has left itself, and us, open for destruction. For whatever satisfaction we may get from the knowledge, our nineteen lives will buy the survival of over one thousand of our fellow starship crewmen.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: I need communications.#
KIRK: Cut power. Keep those shields down.#
KIRK: That's exactly the situation I was hoping for when I forced the M-5 to realise it had committed murder.#
KIRK: Daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of God and man. The computer that carried his engrams also believed it.#
KIRK: I wasn't sure. Any other commander would have simply followed orders and destroyed us, but I knew Bob Wesley.#
KIRK: I gambled on his humanity.#
KIRK: Bridge. His logical selection was compassion.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, take us back to the space station. Ahead, warp factor two.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, sound alert.#
KIRK: Long range sensor scan, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Try to contact her, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: The Exeter. she was patrolling in this area six months ago. I hadn't heard of any trouble.#
KIRK: I see. Magnification factor three, Mister Sulu. (The viewscreen shows a sister ship to the Enterprise orbiting the purple planet.) KIRK: Hold our position out here, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, have Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, and Lieutenant Galloway report to the transporter room. We'll board and investigate.#
KIRK: Phasers on heavy stun. Energise.#
KIRK: Just their uniforms left.#
KIRK: Exactly. When what?#
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Is anyone on board? If there is, and you can hear me, please respond by intercom to the engineering section. Is there anyone on board?#
KIRK: What about the shuttlecraft?#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy and I are going to the Bridge. Meet us there. Captain's log. Aboard the USS Exeter commanded by Ron Tracey, one of the most experienced captains in the Starfleet. What could have happened to him and the over four hundred men and women who were on this ship?#
KIRK: Spock, play the last log tape. Maybe they had time to record what happened to them.#
KIRK: What do you mean?#
KIRK: Prepare to beam down to the planet surface fast. (He turns and looks down at the blue uniform lying on the floor where they saw the doctor fall.)#
KIRK: That's Ron Tracey. Ron.#
KIRK: You were left alone down here, Ron. What happened?#
KIRK: Yes, I know. We saw it.#
KIRK: I don't think we're going to have time to isolate it, Bones.#
KIRK: Are you all right?#
KIRK: Spock, do you see any hope that these Yangs can be reasoned with? A truce, a parley, a#
KIRK: Phaser power packs.#
KIRK: The fool.#
KIRK: The fool. Starfleet should be made aware. (Kirk gets out his communicator, and Tracey enters, phaser ready, and backed up by villagers.)#
KIRK: Sulu!#
KIRK: Captain Ronald Tracey, as per Starfleet Command, regulation seven, paragraph four#
KIRK: Which is, why? (Meanwhile he is quietly loosening the leather thongs around his wrists.)#
KIRK: McCoy could verify all that.#
KIRK: For sale by#
KIRK: Yes, I suppose they would.#
KIRK: It's a very interesting proposition. Let me think it over. (He's got his hands free, so now the two Captains get to fight. Tracey wins.)#
KIRK: I don't think we have the right or the wisdom to interfere, however a planet is evolving.#
KIRK: Don't they ever rest?#
KIRK: Thank you, Spock. (grabs the woman to use her as a shield, but she bites his hand.) At least tell me why you want to kill me.#
KIRK: No point in repeating that it's illogical, Spock. I'm quite aware of it. (The woman is finally within reach of Spock's neck pinch, and down she goes. The male is astonished, and goes to protect her rather than keep fighting.) KIRK: Pity you can't teach me that.#
KIRK: I can't even get at it. He'd be on me in a moment. (the woman is awake again) Keep talking, Spock. Don't let me doze off.#
KIRK: That's a very interesting theory. The yellow civilisation is almost destroyed, the white civilisation is destroyed. Keep working on the window if we're ever going to regain our freedom.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: Well, well, well. It is our worship word, too.#
KIRK: Am I not now a prisoner of the Kohms as you are? (Kirk gets to the barred window and starts working on it. Cloud William helps him.) KIRK: Why did you not speak until now?#
KIRK: Spock, we'll have you out in a minute. (Cloud William knocks Kirk out with the iron bar, them rips the others out of the window to make his escape.)#
KIRK: Spock. How long?#
KIRK: Seven hours and eight. Spock. Keys.  I'll have you out in a minute.#
KIRK: Good morning.#
KIRK: Good. Did you find out anything?#
KIRK: There is a disease here, something that affected the Exeter landing party and us.#
KIRK: Then we can leave any time we want to. Tracey is of the opinion these immunising agents can become a fountain of youth. There are people here over a thousand years old, Bones.#
KIRK: Then anything you develop here as a result of all this is useless.#
KIRK: All that bloodshed for nothing. That'll be sufficient, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: We can beam up at any time. Any of us.#
KIRK: There's no serum! There are no miracles! There's no immortality here! All this is for nothing!#
KIRK: Do what you can for him, Doctor.#
KIRK: Where is everybody?#
KIRK: We can beam up, Tracey. All of us.#
KIRK: All right.  Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Yes, quite all right. I'd like ten phasers beamed down with three extra power packs, please. Have you got that?#
KIRK: Enterprise, do you read me?#
KIRK: Not even if we're in danger, Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: The situation is not immediately dangerous. Have the volunteers stand by. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: If my ancestors were forced out of the cities into the deserts, the hills#
KIRK: Living like the Indians, and finally even looking like the American Indian. American. Yangs? Yanks? Spock, Yankees!;#
KIRK: But if it were true, all these generations of Yanks fighting to regain their land.#
KIRK: And to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.#
KIRK: In my land we have a tribe like you.#
KIRK: Up there. One of those points of light that you see at night.#
KIRK: You're confusing the stars with heaven.#
KIRK: We're not gods! We're not evil ones. We're men, like yourselves.#
KIRK: Are your faces alike? Can you tell from them which of you is good and which of you is evil?#
KIRK: Those words are familiar. Wait a moment.#
KIRK: No, wait! There's a better way. Does not your sacred book promise that good is stronger than evil?#
KIRK: We'll discuss that later, Lieutenant. Leslie, free Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock. Put Captain Tracey under arrest.#
KIRK: Now, Cloud William.#
KIRK: I did not recognise those words, you said them so badly, Without meaning.#
KIRK: This was not written for chiefs.  Hear me! Hear this! Among my people, we carry many such words as this from many lands, many worlds. Many are equally good and are as well respected, but wherever we have gone, no words have said this thing of importance in quite this way. Look at these three words written larger than the rest, with a special pride never written before or since. Tall words proudly saying We the People. That which you call Ee'd Plebnista was not written for the chiefs or the kings or the warriors or the rich and powerful, but for all the people! Down the centuries, you have slurred the meaning of the words, 'We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution.' These words and the words that follow were not written only for the Yangs, but for the Kohms as well!#
KIRK: They must apply to everyone or they mean nothing! Do you understand?#
KIRK: We merely showed them the meaning of what they were fighting for. Liberty and freedom have to be more than just words. Gentlemen, the fighting is over here. I suggest we leave them to discover their history and their liberty.#
KIRK: Alert status. Force shields on maximum. Leslie, begin sensor scan.#
KIRK: It's impossible. The twentieth century had no such#
KIRK: I'll be right there.#
KIRK: Something is shaking us apart.#
KIRK: You're right. Something is beaming aboard. (It's a man in a dark suit, holding a black cat. He steps down from the platform and speaks calmly.)#
KIRK: Security.#
KIRK: Transporter room, on the double.#
KIRK: This is the United Spaceship Enterprise. I'm Captain Kirk, commanding.#
KIRK: Earth.#
KIRK: Phasers on stun.#
KIRK: Humans of the twentieth century do not go beaming around the galaxy, Mister Seven.#
KIRK: The location of that planet?#
KIRK: And if he's lying?#
KIRK: What if it turns out you're an invading alien from the future?#
KIRK: I can't beam you down without further proof one way or the other. Security confinement.#
KIRK: Sickbay.#
KIRK: Bones, check the prisoner you'll find in security confinement. I want a medical analysis fast. Is he or isn't he human? Captain's log, supplemental. A man in a twentieth century business suit. What is he? Not even Spock's Vulcan neck pinch could stop him. Without our phasers, he would have over powered all five of us. I find it difficult to believe the mysterious Mister Seven can be human, and yet, suppose he is?#
KIRK: What do you make of the cat, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: This is the captain. All science, engineering, and supervisory personnel, lock into the briefing room. Our next decision can be of enormous consequence, not only to us but to Earth's entire future. You've already been given as much information as we have. Please break in at any time with analysis of that information. Navigation report.#
KIRK: Engineering.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, historical report.#
KIRK: Weren't orbital nuclear devices one of this era's greatest problems?#
KIRK: If an alien needed a body. ;#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I need proof. All you're telling me is that on the one hand he may be lying and on the other ;#
KIRK: This is the Captain. Inform us#
KIRK: Try to override. Shut it off!#
KIRK: If we beam down, can you compare our position with his control setting?#
KIRK: I'm aware of that. But I must know if he's lying, and we can't answer that sitting up here. Have ship's stores prepare the proper costumes. Stand by to beam us down.#
KIRK: Scotty, lock in on our position.#
KIRK: Scotty,#
KIRK: Out.#
KIRK: Go ahead, Scotty.#
KIRK: Where's Mister Seven?#
KIRK: Where's Mister Seven?#
KIRK: Give me the phone.#
KIRK: Where's Mister Seven?#
KIRK: Plans to McKinley Rocket Base.#
KIRK: Wide scan, Scotty. We'll be moving. Spock, in here. Spock! (They go into the main room and Roberta dashes to open the door to the police.)#
KIRK: Now, Scotty!#
KIRK: Reverse and energise.#
KIRK: Launch is in forty minutes. Stand by to beam us down. Continue visual scan.#
KIRK: Scotty, beam us directly to Seven's apartment.#
KIRK: Hold it right there, Mister Seven.#
KIRK: Spock, you're the expert. Can you detonate the warhead from this computer?#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: I don't know what your job is! You may set those controls so we can't detonate that warhead.#
KIRK: Spock, if you can't handle it, I'm going to have to trust him.#
KIRK: Go.#
KIRK: Our record tapes show, although not generally revealed, that on this date, a malfunctioning suborbital warhead was exploded exactly one hundred and four miles above the Earth.#
KIRK: I'm afraid we can't reveal everything we know, Mister Seven.#
KIRK: Yes, I think we could say that. Two to beam up, Scotty.#
KIRK: And the same to you, Miss Lincoln. Energise.#
KIRK: Steady as she goes. Phaser crew, stand by.#
KIRK: Sensor readings?#
KIRK: Analysis, Science Officer?#
KIRK: Thank you, Science Officer. Come to one eight one mark seven.#
KIRK: It's staying with us.#
KIRK: Full stop, Mister Chekov. Hold your position.#
KIRK: English.#
KIRK: Interesting. Telepathy.#
KIRK: Our orders are very clear. We're to establish contact with the Melkotians at all costs.#
KIRK: What previous contacts have been made with the Melkotians?#
KIRK: Lieutenant, hailing frequencies.#
KIRK: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. We've contacted your buoy and understand its message. We hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you. Lieutenant, answer?#
KIRK: Try again.#
KIRK: Opinion, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: None whatsoever. Mister Chekov, deflectors at full intensity. Increase speed to achieve planet fall as scheduled.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, advise Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scott to meet me in the transporter room. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, let's go find out what it is they're afraid of. Captain's Log, stardate 4385.3. We have transported down to the Melkotian planet and have encountered conditions which are completely contrary to what we were prepared for.#
KIRK: Spock, what is this?#
KIRK: Tricorder readings, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Then let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: We come in peace, but we'll defend ourselves if necessary.#
KIRK: Spock, evaluation?#
KIRK: Or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of our death.#
KIRK: Beautiful specimen.#
KIRK: Whatever the Melkotians have planned for us, it won't be pleasant. These could be useful. Just remember one thing. To individuals at close range, these could be as deadly as phasers.#
KIRK:  October 26, 1881. Tombstone, Arizona.#
KIRK: But why here? And why now?#
KIRK: Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier.#
KIRK: There's something about that date, October 26, 1881 But what was it?#
KIRK: Looks like we did.#
KIRK: You know us?#
KIRK: I'm a barrel of laughs.#
KIRK: Johnny? He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom, and Billy. Ike Clanton, Tom and Frank McLowery, Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton.#
KIRK: In the late nineteenth century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone. The Earps, Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday.#
KIRK: The Clantons lost, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: We are the Clantons. And if this is a replay of history#
KIRK: That's one thing we can be sure of. Death is real.#
KIRK: Yes, of course. The man who kills on sight. Morgan Earp.#
KIRK: Good old Virgil. We can always count on him.#
KIRK: I don't think we're going to have any choice.#
KIRK: No, no, no. All right, all right, all right. We don't want any trouble.#
KIRK: Just leave us alone, Mister Earp. That's all we ask.#
KIRK: I guess so.#
KIRK: Er, Mister Chekov?#
KIRK: Young lady. Young lady.#
KIRK: I'd like to talk to Mister, to Billy alone, if you don't mind.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, you be careful. Mister Spock, except for our hand guns, we haven't changed, not even our clothing, yet these people see and hear us as the Clantons.#
KIRK: All right, what have we got? We're here in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26, 1881. The day of the gunfight at OK Corral. And we're the Clantons, and Morgan Earp has just gone to tell his brothers we're here.#
KIRK: Well, we're not going to be at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon. You, bartender. Ed. You, er, you claim you know us.#
KIRK: Take a close look at me.#
KIRK: Who do you think I am?#
KIRK: I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. These men are part of my crew. We're not really here, we're from the future. We haven't been born yet. Feel the material in my shirt. Now feel the material in your own shirt. Do you notice any difference?#
KIRK: Do these clothes look like yours?#
KIRK: Have you seen clothes like this before?#
KIRK: Where?#
KIRK: I'm not joking.#
KIRK: I'm not joking! I'm not Ike Clanton!#
KIRK: Good morning, gentlemen. My name's James Kirk. I'm afraid there's been some sort of misunderstanding.#
KIRK: Yes, of course you did, and I wanted to talk to you about that.#
KIRK: There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding.#
KIRK: Yes. We'd be glad to. We don't want to fight.#
KIRK: I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mister Earp. My name is not Clanton, it's Kirk.#
KIRK: I'm not joking.#
KIRK: Not me, Mister Earp.#
KIRK: We don't want any trouble. We'll be glad to co-operate.#
KIRK: What do you call that stuff? Fire?#
KIRK: Label it for external use Only.#
KIRK: And your reflexes. We're going to need fast reflexes from now on. There's no negotiating with the Earps. We know that.#
KIRK: Could we make a communicator?#
KIRK: The problem is clear, Spock. We're going to have to seek contemporary solutions. Where's Chekov?#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, I mean Billy. Come along.#
KIRK: Gentlemen.#
KIRK: To exercise the better part of valour. (But when they get to the City Limits notice, they are stopped with a sizzle.) KIRK: Well, that settles that. A force field.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov. If you were in charge of the Enterprise, what would you be doing?#
KIRK: Very good. If we could find the place where we beamed down, the ship might lock in and beam us up.#
KIRK: It could be anywhere within a thousand mile radius.#
KIRK: We have until five o'clock to find that way. Now consider this. What materials were on hand in 1881 that could help us fight the Earps on their own terms?#
KIRK: No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us. We have to find a way to put the Earps out of action. Is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap?#
KIRK: Bones, the venom, the plants. Can you make use of them?#
KIRK: First, Bones, the ingredients you require.#
KIRK: Chekov, mortar and pestle.#
KIRK: How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target?#
KIRK: Cotton wadding. Try the apothecary.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Yes, we can.#
KIRK: Scotty, they're trying to push us into something we're not ready for.#
KIRK: Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning.#
KIRK: But not this minute, Spock. It takes us a little longer.#
KIRK: Bones, Scotty.#
KIRK: About what?#
KIRK: William Claiborne, that's right.#
KIRK: Yes. Yes, that's right. That means it doesn't have to happen the way it happened. We can change it. Bones, how's the tranquilliser coming?#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade?#
KIRK: Forget precision. Will it work?#
KIRK: Make sure it does, Spock. If we don't tranquillise them, we'll have to fight them.#
KIRK: But not with the Earps. I've tried that. That's out. There must be a way. History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead. That means there must be a way to change this history.#
KIRK: Not with the Earps. There is one other place I can try.#
KIRK: Yes, Sheriff. I want you to stop the fight.#
KIRK: I do now.#
KIRK: How else is he going to get justice?#
KIRK: It's not too late. Sheriff. Sheriff. There must be plenty of decent people in town who don't like the Earps. Let's organise them.#
KIRK: Then the people had better wake up and let the law work for them.#
KIRK: Yes, I want revenge. I want to crush the life out of the Earps. But I can't just kill them.#
KIRK: Can't I get it through your stupid head? I can't just kill them! I can't murder them!#
KIRK: I can't kill them! I can't kill them!#
KIRK: How soon will that be ready?#
KIRK: Good. How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect?#
KIRK: How did you manage to test it?#
KIRK: Up to now, everything has gone wrong. I want it tested now.#
KIRK: It doesn't work.#
KIRK: It was our last chance.#
KIRK: We need a weapon. An answer.#
KIRK: Ten minutes and it's all going to end at the OK Corral. Well, we're going to wait right here until well after five o'clock. We're not going to move from this spot.#
KIRK: Let's get out of here.#
KIRK: Scotty, Bones.  We're trapped. They got their way. We've got to stand and fight.#
KIRK: They're experts at gunfighting. We don't have a chance.#
KIRK: Spock, you've got something?#
KIRK: It would've been effective anywhere else.#
KIRK: Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him.#
KIRK: But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation. If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us.#
KIRK: We must all be as certain as you are, Mister Spock, to save our lives.#
KIRK: We must. Spock, a Vulcan mind meld.#
KIRK: Right here, it seems.#
KIRK: Do you remember anything else?#
KIRK: Good. Perhaps that explains why he's here. Nothing was real to him except the girl.#
KIRK: Sensor readings.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, sound Red Alert. Mister Chekov, deflector shields on full. Phaser gun crews, lock on target.#
KIRK: Phaser guns, stand by to fire.#
KIRK: Damage report, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: It is. We fight only when there's no choice. We prefer the ways of peaceful contact. I speak for a vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing. We have sought you out to join us. Our mission is still one of peace.#
KIRK: Excellent. Lieutenant, cancel Red Alert. Mister Chekov, resume original course, warp factor two.#
KIRK: I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Is that the way it seemed to you, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you're absolutely right. That's exactly the way it was.#
KIRK: That's the way it was in 1881.#
KIRK: We overcame our instinct for violence.#
KIRK: Some desk-bound Starfleet bureaucrat cut these cloak-and-dagger orders.#
KIRK: My orders are to co-operate with Ambassador Petri in all matters pertaining to his mission here.#
KIRK: Scotty.  Kirk here. What is it?#
KIRK: Demand? What delay? All right. Beam them aboard.#
KIRK: Ambassador Petri, would you drop all this nonsense and tell me what this is about?#
KIRK: Dohlman? What the devil is a Dohlman?#
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. This ship is under my command.#
KIRK: This ship is secure and we're prepared for any hostile acts. Energise.#
KIRK: Body armour, nuclear weapons.#
KIRK: Well, now, just a moment. There's going to have to be some kind of understanding.#
KIRK: My first officer Mister Spock will show you to your quarters. Ambassador, I'd like to speak to you.#
KIRK: May I have your permission to go?#
KIRK: Why, thank you. Ambassador.#
KIRK: Ambassador, I think it's time you told me what's going on.#
KIRK: I see. So, we go back to Troyius.#
KIRK: And you are to be her teacher?#
KIRK: Yes, that I can understand.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius. Mister Sulu, impulse drive, speed factor point zero three seven.#
KIRK: Yes, that's correct, Mister Sulu. Sublight factor point zero three seven.#
KIRK: You in a hurry, Mister Scott?#
KIRK: Yes, I appreciate your sacrifice, Lieutenant Uhura. I'll talk to her myself.#
KIRK: I understand you're not happy with your quarters.#
KIRK: Yes, not happy at all.#
KIRK: My communications officer generously vacated the rooms hoping you would find it satisfactory.#
KIRK: Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding to instruction.#
KIRK: There are none better. I suggest you make do with these.#
KIRK: There are no more available, but if that's the only way you can get gratification, I'll arrange to have the whole room filled from floor to ceiling with breakable objects.#
KIRK: Then act in a civilised fashion.#
KIRK: I didn't ask for any.#
KIRK: Ambassador! This is supposed to be a peaceful mission.#
KIRK: You're as bad as she is. It's not required that you like each other. Just do your job.#
KIRK: Stop trying to kill each other. Then worry about being friendly.#
KIRK: Then make her listen, Ambassador. Use a different approach. Stop being so diplomatic. She respects strength. Go in strong.#
KIRK: Hydrogen cloud reflection?#
KIRK: Speculation?#
KIRK: It's not an instrument malfunction. It's not a reflection from a natural phenomenon. A spaceship?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Hang on, Scotty. Be pleasant no matter how much it hurts. I'll be right down.#
KIRK: Mister Scott! I wish you had told me you wanted a tour of the engineering department.#
KIRK: Courtesy. Remember?#
KIRK: Courtesy is for everyone around here, and you'll find you won't be able to exist on Troyius without it. Mister Scott, our Chief Engineer, has shown you his engineering department. That's a courtesy. You respond by saying thank you.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: On my way.#
KIRK: Whose?#
KIRK: Main screen. Extreme magnification.#
KIRK: A Klingon warship.  Any change, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it?#
KIRK: On my way.#
KIRK: I said talk with her, not fight with her.#
KIRK: Yes. Certainly.#
KIRK: What was it?#
KIRK: Ambassador, there's an added complication. The Federation High Commissioner will be attending the wedding.#
KIRK: I'm not asking you to have anything to do with me. Do your job with her. How long before he's on his feet?#
KIRK: Nothing would please me more, Your Glory. But your impetuous nature#
KIRK: You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people. You must understand discipline to be able to give and take orders. My orders are to take you to Troyius to be married and to see that you learn Troyian customs.#
KIRK: It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other.#
KIRK: Well, we're still faced with the same problem.#
KIRK: Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and manners.#
KIRK: You have eliminated the teacher. The problem still remains.#
KIRK: By giving you a new teacher.#
KIRK: Table manners, for one thing. This is a plate. It contains food. This is a knife. It cuts the food. This is a glass.#
KIRK: Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered to learn.#
KIRK: That's impossible.#
KIRK: That's the first problem we're going to work on. Then we'll get you ready to go to Troyius.#
KIRK: You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman. Then be worthy of them. If you don't want the obligations that go along with the title, then give it up.#
KIRK: That's another one of your problems. Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman's body, an arrogant monster!#
KIRK: That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth. (He turns to leave, she takes a knife from her sleeve and throws it. It just misses him and sticks in the wall.) KIRK: Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency, identify us, and ask the Klingon his intentions.#
KIRK: I see. All right, Lieutenant. Monitor all frequencies. Phaser crews stand by. Maintain Yellow Alert.#
KIRK: Where's Kryton?#
KIRK: Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. When they wake up, take them to Security holding.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim.#
KIRK: Only in self-defence. Now, are you going to behave or not?#
KIRK: We're not on Elas. We're on my starship. I command here.#
KIRK: If I touch you again, Your Glory, it'll be to administer an ancient Earth custom called a spanking, a form of punishment administered to spoiled brats.#
KIRK: You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in courtesy.#
KIRK: Very well. I'll send in Mister Spock or Doctor McCoy. Either way, you're going to be properly prepared for Troyius. As ordered by councils, rulers, and bureaucrats.#
KIRK: No, no, you were right the first time. There's nothing I can teach you. There's nothing you do not know.#
KIRK: Well, it's not it's not that people hate you. It's just that people don't like to be treated as though they don't exist.#
KIRK: It's, er, gotten very, er. Something must've gone wrong with the ventilation system.#
KIRK: Pardon me, Your Glory. There will be a short recess.#
KIRK: It's, er, It's, er. We'll talk about it later.#
KIRK: Inside the Enterprise? Can you pinpoint it?#
KIRK: Security to Engineering. Intruder alert. Security alert to all decks. Kirk out.#
KIRK: It's Klingon. Bones?#
KIRK: What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship?#
KIRK: Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture. Kirk to Spock.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, it was Kryton transmitting. He refuses to talk. I'll need you for the Vulcan mind meld.#
KIRK: What was he trying to cover that was so important he felt he had to die for it? Scotty, he didn't come into Engineering just to use the transmitter. I want you to check every relay you've got.#
KIRK: Don't waste the time telling me about it. Get to it.#
KIRK: He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy?#
KIRK: There's a Klingon warship out there. What's their involvement? Surely all of this isn't because they want to stop a marriage.#
KIRK: Elaan. Elaan, two planets, an entire star system's stability depends on it. We have a duty to forget what happened.#
KIRK: My orders and yours say that you belong to another man. What happened, what happened was an accident.#
KIRK: What kind of a mind could think of such a thing?#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: It's true. Bones, you've got to find me an antidote.#
KIRK: Captain here.#
KIRK: I'm on my way. Battle stations.#
KIRK: Phasers stand by.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, lay in a course to take us out of this star system. If they want to fight, Let's get some manoeuvering room.#
KIRK: All right. Ahead warp factor two.#
KIRK: Belay that order. What is it, Scotty?#
KIRK: Scotty, that bomb he planted. Can you dismantle it?#
KIRK: Give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive, and find a solution to the bomb. Kirk out. Mister Sulu, stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly. She'll be sluggish on response.#
KIRK: Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command.#
KIRK: Ready.#
KIRK: Hold your fire.#
KIRK: Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock. They were trying to make us cut in warp drive. That way we'd have blown ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the Federation. Very neat.#
KIRK: Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I'll be the judge. Yes, you're quite right. Thank you, Mister Spock.  I want you to go to Sickbay. It's the best protected part of the ship.#
KIRK: Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency, my ability to protect you. Mister Spock, you have the conn.#
KIRK: Deck five.#
KIRK: If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll gladly do that.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Yes, Elaan.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: No chance of restoring warp drive?#
KIRK: Kirk out. Elaan, I have to go back to the Bridge. Please, you must go to Sickbay.#
KIRK: They're trying to force a fight. Scotty, what's our energy status?#
KIRK: And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines?#
KIRK: We'll stall for time, proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed. Or that they're not prepared for a general war. Open a hailing frequency.#
KIRK: This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise on Federation business. Our mission is peaceful, but we're not prepared to accept any interference.#
KIRK: I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective.#
KIRK: Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks?#
KIRK: I told you to stay in Sickbay.#
KIRK: We're not going to die. Now get off the bridge.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, bring her to one four three mark two. Keep our forward shields to him.#
KIRK: Stay with the controls. Keep our forward shields to him.#
KIRK: Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around. He's going for our flank. Sulu!#
KIRK: How bad?#
KIRK: What sort of readings, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Elaan?#
KIRK: What kind of jewels are in this?#
KIRK: Common stones? Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this system. May I have this?#
KIRK: You may have just saved our lives. Mister Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port. Try and protect the number four shield.#
KIRK: Now, Sulu. hard a-port!#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency.#
KIRK: This is Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. May I request your terms for surrender?#
KIRK: Scotty, your estimate.#
KIRK: Test it in combat.#
KIRK: Let me know when it's in place. Open a hailing frequency.#
KIRK: This is the Enterprise. Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas?#
KIRK: You and Spock get up here. Sulu, prepare for warp manoeuvres.#
KIRK: Chekov, arm photon torpedoes.#
KIRK: Negative. His sensors will pick up our power increase. The more helpless he thinks we are, the closer he'll come. As he passes, I want to cut in warp drive. We'll pivot at warp two and bring all tubes to bear.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes.#
KIRK: Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive.#
KIRK: Fire at minimum range.#
KIRK: Warp in, Scotty. Full power to shields.#
KIRK: Warp factor two. Bring us to course one four eight mark three.#
KIRK: Chekov, photon torpedoes. Fire!#
KIRK: Secure from general quarters. Well done, Mister Sulu. Scotty.#
KIRK: No. Mister Sulu, resume course for Troyius.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: I have no choice.#
KIRK: Goodbye. Energise.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, prepare to take us out of orbit.#
KIRK: Ahead warp factor two.#
KIRK: And that lake.#
KIRK: I swear that's a little orange blossom thrown in. It's unbelievable. Growth exactly like that of Earth on a planet half a galaxy away. What are the odds on such duplication?#
KIRK: Analysis, Spock.#
KIRK: Any theories about what it is?#
KIRK: What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: And how much time did you say we have to investigate?#
KIRK: You did say thirty minutes?#
KIRK: Then let's go. Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this environment. (Standing on the opposite side of the lake from a collection of tipis and a lodge.)#
KIRK: It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la. Mister Spock, is it possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet, one capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector system?#
KIRK: Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world into atoms?#
KIRK: We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise.#
KIRK: What? Oh, nothing. It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated. No problems, no command decisions. Just living.#
KIRK: Ah, the Tahiti Syndrome. Let's go take care of that asteroid. But first I want another look at that obelisk.#
KIRK:  Kirk to Enterprise. (and drops suddenly out of our sight)#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: I'll answer anything I can, but as I told you, many things are strange to me.#
KIRK: I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning for me here. But I came from the sky, too. Only I can't remember. I can't remember.#
KIRK: Wait a moment.#
KIRK: He'll be all right now.#
KIRK: It's a simple technique. It goes way back. Way back.#
KIRK: Miramanee, tell me about the Wise Ones.#
KIRK: Not this one. Tell me.#
KIRK: Secrets of the temple.#
KIRK: The secrets were passed on from father to son?#
KIRK: Well, why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger?#
KIRK: Ki, Kir#
KIRK: No, no, everything is fine.#
KIRK: Your land is rich, your people happy. Who could be displeased with that?#
KIRK: I can't tell you anything. All I can tell you is that I'm happy and peaceful here. I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before.#
KIRK: Why are they so sure I can help them?#
KIRK: Yes, but I. I need time to remember.#
KIRK: The Joining day?#
KIRK: No, Miramanee, there's no one else in my mind or my heart.#
KIRK: Name the Joining day.#
KIRK: Get out of my way, Salish.#
KIRK: Nobody's asking for your permission.#
KIRK: I have no intention of striking you dead.#
KIRK: Miramanee. Come here. Miramanee.#
KIRK: I'm happy. I'm so happy. If it weren't for the dreams, my mind would be completely at peace.#
KIRK: They've come back. They were gone for a while, but they've come back, and I see faces, too. Very dim. I feel I should know know them. I feel my place is with them, not here. I don't deserve this happiness.#
KIRK: A gift? What?#
KIRK: You!#
KIRK: A canal. And with it we'll bring the water from the lake right to the lodge. And we can expand the system, and irrigate the fields and double the food supply.#
KIRK: Lamp.#
KIRK: Preserve.#
KIRK: Preserve. MIRAMANEE@ For times of famine. That is why you made the lamp, Kirok, so that I would never know when it was night, and I would be forever cooking. KIRK: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. That's not why I made the lamp at all, to keep you forever cooking.#
KIRK: It's only the wind and the thunder.#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: But it's only the wind. The wind can't harm them.#
KIRK: But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky.#
KIRK: I don't know how to get inside the temple.#
KIRK: We'll go to the caves. It'll be safe there.#
KIRK: Take care of Miramanee.#
KIRK: I am Kirok! I have come! I am Kirok!#
KIRK: Miramanee!#
KIRK: My wife. Is she all right?#
KIRK: Miramanee. (Spock rolls Miramanee onto her back, and Chapel gives her an injection.)#
KIRK: No!#
KIRK: Miramanee! No! Miramanee!#
KIRK: I am Kirok! I am#
KIRK: It worked.#
KIRK: Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment.#
KIRK: McCoy.#
KIRK: I don't know how to get inside.#
KIRK: The key must be in these symbols. We've got to decipher them.#
KIRK: You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument?#
KIRK: Give me your communicator. Tonal control, consonants and vowels. I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship.#
KIRK:  Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within twenty minutes, get out of orbit. Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone. The landing party is expendable. The Enterprise isn't. Kirk out. Miramanee. Bones, stay with her. Do what you can.#
KIRK: Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering.#
KIRK: More symbols. Can you read them?#
KIRK: Spock, just press the right button. (Spock presses the middle button of a row of three, and other sections light up. A blue beam shoots out of the top of the obelisk and pushes the asteroid away.)#
KIRK: How is she?#
KIRK: Will she live?#
KIRK: And so are your people, Miramanee.#
KIRK: If that's what you want.#
KIRK: And I'll love you, Miramanee. Always.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Chekov. I can read, and as usual your theoretical evaluations do not tally with mine. Return to your duty and I'll let you know when your work is satisfactory. KIRK: Mister Spock. Full sensor scan of the region, please.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, that was the past. I'm concerned with the present. Or is it becoming too much for this crew to present me current information? SPOCK; No, sir. Compliance presents no problem. KIRK: Then, Mister Spock, comply.#
KIRK: Very well.#
KIRK: Change course. Come about to one eight five, mark three.#
KIRK: Yes, very perceptive, Mister Sulu. I know where the course change takes us. Execute.#
KIRK: Better and better, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Very well, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: If you two have complaints, you can bring them out into the open.#
KIRK: Sound Red Alert. Man battle stations. Stand by main phasers.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command. Advise them of our situation. Include all log entries to this point.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, your sensors read clear. What happened?#
KIRK: Put it on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and complete that message to Starfleet Command.#
KIRK: Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: Lieutenant.  They want something, or they would have destroyed us by now.#
KIRK: It's my ship they want, and very badly.#
KIRK: Lieutenant.  Save your threats. If you board this ship, I'll blow it up. You'll gain nothing.#
KIRK: My first officer, Commander Spock.#
KIRK: You understand that Starfleet Command has been advised of the situation?#
KIRK: The design of the ship is the same. Mister Spock, you said you had a theory on why your sensors didn't pick up the new ships until they were upon us.#
KIRK: If so, Romulans could attack in Federation territory before we knew they were there, before a vessel or planet could get even begin to get their defences up.#
KIRK: Well, that's a brilliant observation, Mister Scott. Do you have any other helpful opinions?#
KIRK: We have three. We can fight and be destroyed, or we can destroy the Enterprise ourselves and keep her from the Romulans. Or we can surrender. Opinions, gentlemen.#
KIRK: Dismissed, Doctor.#
KIRK: I said dismissed.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Put them on the screen.#
KIRK: Put him on.#
KIRK: Why should we walk right into your hands?#
KIRK: What guarantee do we have they'll beam aboard our ship once we're on yours?#
KIRK: Give us your transporter co-ordinates. We're beaming aboard.#
KIRK: One final order, Engineer Scott. If we do not return, the Enterprise must not be taken. If the Romulans attempt it, you're to fight, and if necessary, destroy yourselves. Is that clear?#
KIRK: Energise. (As Kirk and Spock beam out, two Romulans beam in. Once solid, they draw their weapons. Scott scowls.)#
KIRK: Commander. I'm honoured.#
KIRK: Instrument failure caused navigational error. We were across the Neutral Zone before we realised it, then we were surrounded by your ships before we could get back.#
KIRK: Accidents happen. Cut off back-up systems malfunction. We were due for overhaul two months ago.#
KIRK: The error was corrected.#
KIRK: We were not spying, Commander.#
KIRK: You're grossly mistaken if you think we were there#
KIRK: What earns Spock your special interest?#
KIRK: You've been told everything. There's nothing else to say.#
KIRK: We've been all through that, Commander!#
KIRK: Let her rant. There's nothing to say.#
KIRK: That's a lie!#
KIRK: Shut up, Spock!#
KIRK: You filthy liar!#
KIRK:  I'll kill you, you filthy traitor! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!#
KIRK: Did you hear that, you coward? You've betrayed everything of value you ever knew. Did you hear the sound of human integrity?#
KIRK: You traitor. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! (Kirk lunges feebly at Spock, who places his hand over Kirk's face. Kirk falls back, face contorted with pain.)#
KIRK: Oh.  My neck feels like it's been twisted off.#
KIRK: Ah, but the Romulans don't know that. Sure fooled the doctors.#
KIRK: As far as the rest of the crew's concerned, I'm still dead.#
KIRK: That's what this whole masquerade was about. To keep the Enterprise and the Federation off the hook.#
KIRK: Bones, I want you to prepare for surgery.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Are those Romulan officers still aboard the ship?#
KIRK: I'll need a Romulan uniform. SCOTT; Aye. It'll be a pleasure.#
KIRK: I wish I knew. Scotty, are you sure we have a clear channel to Spock?#
KIRK: Then we can't wait any longer. Prepare to beam me aboard the flagship.#
KIRK: It can't be helped, Scotty.#
KIRK: Just don't put me inside a bulkhead. Energise.#
KIRK: I've just effected an escape from the Federation vessel. I have important information for Sub-commander Tal. Where is he?#
KIRK: Good. I shall remember to mention your alertness to him. Return to your duty.#
KIRK: I'm already on board, Spock. Do you have the information?#
KIRK: Spock, I'll get the cloaking device. Will you be able to get back to the Enterprise without attracting their attention?#
KIRK: There's an intruder aboard. Has someone tried to gain entrance there?#
KIRK: Over there!#
KIRK: There's an enemy spy aboard. He'll be after the cloaking device.#
KIRK: Scotty, energise.#
KIRK: We'll just have to hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed.#
KIRK: Can you do it?#
KIRK: You have fifteen minutes, Scotty.#
KIRK: The report was premature.#
KIRK: We'll discuss it later. Mister Sulu, lay in a course for home. Mister Chekov, take the sensors. Mister Spock is still aboard the Romulan flagship. I want his body readings pinpointed and isolated. That was not a request, gentlemen.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, there's only one Vulcan aboard that ship. He should be easy enough to locate.#
KIRK: Feed the co-ordinates to the transporter room on the double. Have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal.#
KIRK: Go ahead, Scotty.#
KIRK: Stand by, Scotty.#
KIRK: Transporter room, beam Mister Spock aboard.#
KIRK: The commander?#
KIRK: All right. Have them report to the Bridge on the double. Mister Sulu, take us away from the Romulans. Warp factor nine.#
KIRK: Scotty, throw the switch on that device.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, open a channel to the Romulan vessel.#
KIRK: Establish two-way visual contact.#
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. Hold your fire. We have your commander aboard.#
KIRK: Break contact!#
KIRK: Scotty, we're running out of time.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, distance from the Romulan vessel?#
KIRK: Stand by, phasers. Commander, you'll forgive me if I put up a fight.#
KIRK: Scotty.#
KIRK: Throw the switch.#
KIRK: Throw the switch. (Scott does, and the Enterprise gently vanishes, like a Cheshire cat.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, come about. Three one eight mark seven.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. Cancel Red Alert. We'll let you off at the nearest Federation outpost.#
KIRK: Mister Spock will have the honour of escorting you to your quarters.#
KIRK: Commander.#
KIRK: Very good, Mister Chekov. Thank you, Mister Leslie.#
KIRK: What is it, Bones?#
KIRK: What for?#
KIRK: I'm on my way.#
KIRK: Professor Starnes? It's Kirk.#
KIRK: He didn't seem to know me. (Kirk takes the dead man's tricorder, then goes over to a woman and removes a vial from her mouth.)#
KIRK: Self-inflicted.#
KIRK: All this. Self-inflicted. Mass suicide. (The sound of children playing, then the kids run into the scene. There's a girl, three small boys and one older boy.)#
KIRK: Kirk of the starship Enterprise.#
KIRK: No sign of grief?#
KIRK: Or of fear.#
KIRK: And you insist their behaviour indicates traumatic shock?#
KIRK: A child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead? I can't believe it.#
KIRK: Not these children, to this extent. It's incredible.#
KIRK: I'll be guided by that opinion, Doctor, for the present. What about questioning them?#
KIRK: Accepted, Doctor.#
KIRK: Careful.#
KIRK: Children. Children, listen to me. It's late and it's time to go up to the ship.#
KIRK: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You'll go up with the doctor.#
KIRK: Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children.#
KIRK: Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be.#
KIRK: Such as?#
KIRK: What would make the children immune?#
KIRK: Then the children would have been exempted by conscious design.#
KIRK: And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment.#
KIRK: An attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet. This planet is uninhabited, Mister Spock, to the best of our information?#
KIRK: Getting a reading?#
KIRK: Picking up any life-forms, Mister Spock?#
KIRK:  Oh, that's strange. That's very strange. I'm getting a feeling of anxiety in this place. It doesn't sound very scientific, does it? But it's strongest right here.#
KIRK: Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder.#
KIRK: No, of course. That's, that's me. That's me. But what's causing your tricorder to react?#
KIRK: Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here. Let's get back to the ship. I want to check out those tapes from Professor Starnes' tricorder. And I am going to question those children.#
KIRK: There has to be an answer.#
KIRK: We're not leaving here until we find out what went on or what's going on.#
KIRK: It could be far worse for them if I don't, and for us too.#
KIRK: Well, well, well. You're all having such a good time, I think I'll join you. Is that all right?#
KIRK: I'll have a dish, too.#
KIRK: A little one. A very small one. It's better than Triacus, isn't it?#
KIRK: I don't think your parents liked it very much either.#
KIRK: I'm sure your parents loved you. That's why they took you with them to Triacus. So they wouldn't be so far away from you for such a long time. That would make them very unhappy and miss you. I'm sure that you would miss them, too.#
KIRK: Now wait a minute.#
KIRK: No, I don't think so. It'll spoil your dinner.#
KIRK: All right, children, you've had a busy day. I think you could use some rest. Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters.#
KIRK: Tommy, Just a moment. I'd like to ask you a question. Come and sit down. Tommy, will you tell me what you saw?#
KIRK: In the cave, on the planet. On Triacus.#
KIRK: Did you see your father today?#
KIRK: Did he seem upset?#
KIRK: What about?#
KIRK: What was going on that would have upset him?#
KIRK: I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends. We invited you aboard the Enterprise. Why would I do that if I didn't like you?#
KIRK: Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus?#
KIRK: Aren't you upset about leaving your parents?#
KIRK: Yes, certainly. I'll take you.#
KIRK: Kirk to security. Post a guard on the children. They're to be kept under constant watch.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, any report from the planet security team?#
KIRK: Good.#
KIRK: Let's see them.#
KIRK: Let's see some more of these unscientific hypotheses, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: What happened?#
KIRK: I didn't see you come in, Tommy.#
KIRK: No. We'll probably take you to a Federation Starbase.#
KIRK: I'm sorry, Tommy. Marcos Twelve is not within our patrol area. Mister Spock, we'll pursue this in my quarters.#
KIRK: All right, Tommy. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy report to my quarters for a brief conference. Mister Leslie?#
KIRK: That could be what destroyed him.#
KIRK: Misleading the innocent? I wonder.#
KIRK: Yes, Doctor. Spock what do we know about the race that lived here?#
KIRK: Is that the end of it?#
KIRK: Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst?#
KIRK: But most legends have their basis in fact, Spock.#
KIRK: I understand your diagnosis, Doctor, and I'll respect it. But not to the exclusion and safety of the Enterprise. Thank you.#
KIRK: Spock, what other expeditions have visited Triacus?#
KIRK: What was it Professor Starnes said about the unseen force?#
KIRK: A ship. Yes, a ship for Triacus. But why? By whom? Security detachment. Ready for relief duty on Triacus. Assemble in the transporter room immediately. I'll have some questions for that planet detachment as soon as they're beamed up. I think it's about time we found out whether Professor Starnes' enemy within is on the planet below or here onboard ship with us. Come on.#
KIRK: Your tour of duty will last one hour. Be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings. Don't wait to investigate. Beam down the guards.#
KIRK: Beam up the security detachment from Triacus. Spock? What's wrong?#
KIRK: Why not?#
KIRK: That's impossible. If we're not orbiting Triacus, then the men I beamed down are dead.#
KIRK: Activate the bridge monitor screen.#
KIRK: Captain to Bridge.#
KIRK: You're off course. I'm coming right up.#
KIRK: Sulu!#
KIRK: Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think you see on the screen. Set a course for Starbase Four.#
KIRK: Helmsman, did you hear me?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starbase Four. Tell them we're bringing the children there. Tell Starfleet Command I suspect them of being alien in nature, and I want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, what are you staring at?#
KIRK: Lieutenant, there's nothing there.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you make the call to Starfleet. Mister Sulu, I ordered you to change course. Mister Sulu#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, there's nothing there.#
KIRK: That was an order, Spock.#
KIRK: Complete?#
KIRK: Take a look around you.#
KIRK: Take Mister Sulu to his quarters. He is relieved of duty. (But Tommy stops the guard, and everyone else, from hearing what the captain is saying. It sounds total gibberish. Only Spock manages to clear his mind.) KIRK: Confine them to quarters. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? (Tommy summons Kirk's beast to haunt him. Loss of confidence and control. Fear of indecision.)#
KIRK: Yes, we must. I'm losing command. I'm losing my ability to command. I'm losing the Enterprise.#
KIRK: I'm losing command. I'm losing the Enterprise. The ship is sailing on and on. I'm alone. Alone. Alone. I'm losing command.#
KIRK: I've lost command. I've lost the Enterprise.#
KIRK: I've got command. I've got command. I've got command.#
KIRK: Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend. This ship is off course.#
KIRK: Scotty. I want you to override the bridge navigation system and plot a course for Starbase Four.#
KIRK: Why not?#
KIRK: Scotty, listen to me. The Enterprise has been invaded by alien beings. Its destination is Marcos. If we take it there, millions will die the way they died at Triacus. (Kirk tries to jump the engineer at the controls, but he and Spock are forced away. They retreat.)#
KIRK: No, I'm all right, Spock. My beast is finished. It won't return.#
KIRK: Spock, they're not the alien beings. They're children being misled.#
KIRK: They're children.#
KIRK: They don't understand the evil that they're doing.#
KIRK: We'll have to kill them.#
KIRK: What is it, Ensign?#
KIRK: By whose order?#
KIRK: Where did you hear this order, Ensign? Now, listen to me. This order is false. I want you and your men to return to their stations.#
KIRK: Ensign, listen to me.#
KIRK: Ensign, listen to me. This is a false order, Ensign.#
KIRK: I know that, Ensign. You have never disobeyed an order, but an alien being is aboard this ship.#
KIRK: Ensign, listen to me. You will disobey this order! Starfleet Command supersedes your order, sir! (Spock and Kirk jump them. Tommy's fist is working overtime to try and control the situation, but Kirk and Spock win the fight.) KIRK: Enough. Take these men to detention then join me on the bridge.#
KIRK: The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Twelve. We will not be landing there.#
KIRK: The crew does not understand. When we make them understand as I understand, they won't take you to Marcos.#
KIRK: Your friend? Where is your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why does he hide?#
KIRK: Good. I'm glad you're not afraid of me.  But your leader is afraid. What's he afraid of?#
KIRK: He's afraid to be seen. And when the crew sees and hears him, they'll understand that he is not their friend, and they won't follow him.#
KIRK: Then let him show himself. Bring him out! Let him prove to me that he is my friend and I'll follow him to Marcos Twelve and to the ends of the universe!#
KIRK: Mister Spock, playback the chant the children sang to summon up the Gorgan.#
KIRK: The time has come to see the world as it is. Come on.#
KIRK: I did, Gorgan. My beast is gone. It lost its power in the light of reality. I command again, and I ordered you here.#
KIRK: And we know you.#
KIRK: Not if we join together to fight you.#
KIRK: We're also very strong.#
KIRK: Children, I have pictures of some of you on Triacus. I'd like to show them to you. Would you like to see them? Mister Spock, the pictures.#
KIRK: So we were told. Mister Spock, the pictures. The children are waiting. (Film of the children playing with their parents appears on Spock's overhead monitor. They smile as they watch themselves having fun. Then they see their parents lying dead, and the smiles are gone.)#
KIRK: Not always, Gorgan. Not this time. You can't hide from them. They see you as we see you. They know what you are. Even the children learn.#
KIRK: Don't be afraid. Look at him. Without you children, he's nothing. The evil remains within him.#
KIRK: Look how ugly he really is. Look at him and don't be afraid.#
KIRK: It's all right.#
KIRK: It's all right, Mary. It's all right. It's all right, isn't it, Doctor?#
KIRK: Reverse course, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Set course for Starbase Four, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: What do you read, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Any contact, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Keep trying.#
KIRK: Magnification ten, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Well, Scotty?#
KIRK: Interesting design.#
KIRK: Life forms, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Directed at what?#
KIRK: Security guard.#
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk. This is the Starship Enterprise. (The security guards rush in, she presses a button on her wrist band, the power goes off and everyone collapses. Then the same happens to the crew all over the ship. The woman walks over to Spock, and puts her hand on his head.) (Later - after the opening titles - the power comes back on and everyone wakes up again.)#
KIRK: Helm status, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Condition reports from all decks, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Spock. Where's Spock?#
KIRK: Yes, what is it?#
KIRK: All right. On my way.#
KIRK: Spock. What happened?#
KIRK: Like this?#
KIRK: What happened?#
KIRK: You've got him on complete life support. Was he dead?#
KIRK: What do you mean?#
KIRK: Come on, Bones. What's the mystery?#
KIRK: His what?#
KIRK: How could he survive?#
KIRK: If his brain is missing, then Spock is dying.#
KIRK: That girl.#
KIRK: From that ship. She took it. I don't know why, or where, but she must have taken it. Bones, how long can you keep him functioning?#
KIRK: That's not good enough, Doctor.#
KIRK: Then we'll take him with us.#
KIRK: In search of his brain, Doctor. From what you say, the moment we find it we must restore it to his body, or we lose him.#
KIRK: I'll find it.#
KIRK: It was taken out. It can be put back in.#
KIRK: The thief that took it has the knowledge. I'll force it out of her.#
KIRK: You and Scotty have Spock ready.#
KIRK: Where does the trail lead to?#
KIRK: Lock on, Mister Sulu. Maximum speed.#
KIRK: No question about the trail?#
KIRK: All scanners, extreme sweep.#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: We've lost her trail, but she went into that system. Mister Chekov, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen.#
KIRK: Read out, Mister Chekov?#
KIRK: She was breathing our air. She must've gone to one of them. Show us the three Class-M planets. Mister Chekov. (Chekov gets up and goes to the viewscreen to point out the relevant items.)#
KIRK: Earth equivalent approximately 1485.#
KIRK: The year 2030.#
KIRK: Third Class M planet, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Now. as I understand it, Mister Chekov, there are three Class-M planets,#
KIRK: Not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight,#
KIRK: Yet one of them accomplished it.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: That's the primitive glaciated planet.#
KIRK: The source of it?#
KIRK: What do your surface readings show, Mister Chekov?#
KIRK: With regular pulsations of generated energy?#
KIRK: I can't afford to guess wrong. I've got to choose the right planet, get there, find the brain. Eight hours and thirty five minutes. KIRK: Recommendations, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: But advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities. It'd be a miracle if they had developed it.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: Yes. Why would they want it? Eight hours and thirty four minutes. Planet six is glaciated, you say?#
KIRK: But the energy. Regular. It's there. It's real.#
KIRK: Have the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down to planet six.#
KIRK: A hunch, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: If I guess wrong, Mister Spock is dead. Spock will die. Captain's log, stardate 4351.5. We are beaming down to a primitive glaciated planet in the Sigma Draconis star system. Time left to us to find Spock's brain, eight hours and twenty nine minutes.#
KIRK: Suit temperatures to seventy two. Life-form readings, Mister Spock?  Mister Scott?#
KIRK: Watch out. We know their development is primitive.#
KIRK: Read out, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: You have a thick skin.#
KIRK: Phasers on stun. I want them conscious. (The group of bearded, skin clad males with clubs move carefully towards the Starfleet party.) KIRK: Fire only on my signal. Flank out. (The primitives suddenly leap up from behind rocks, throwing stones and their clubs. Kirk fires, and stuns the leader. The rest run away.) KIRK: We mean you no harm. We're not your enemies, we're your friends. We only wish to talk to you.#
KIRK: No. We come from a far place. We are men.#
KIRK: Like yourselves.#
KIRK: Who are the Others?#
KIRK: Do they live here with you?#
KIRK: Do they come from the sky?#
KIRK: Do they come for your women as well?#
KIRK: The female of your kind.#
KIRK: Don't you have a mate?#
KIRK: Will you take us where we can find the Others?#
KIRK: We do. We want to find them. Take us there and we'll let you go.#
KIRK: Buildings?#
KIRK: Somewhere down there is where the Others live. Scotty, see if you can find a way down.#
KIRK: It's all right.#
KIRK: It's all right. Let him go.#
KIRK: What was it he said, pain and delight?#
KIRK: A dead and buried city on a planet in a glacial age.#
KIRK: I don't think so. Scotty. (There is a pair of photoelectric cells creating an invisible trip wire across the front of the supplies.) KIRK: Metal. Forged, tempered. Our apish friends didn't make these. What do you think?#
KIRK: Or the food could be a lure set by the Others to bring them in here.#
KIRK: And this cave a trap.#
KIRK: Exactly.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Have Doctor McCoy beam down immediately.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, you and the security team will remain here at the entrance. We'll be in constant contact with you.#
KIRK: All right, Bones. Bring him along.#
KIRK: Ready? (He steps across the beam and a metal shutter slams down, sealing the cave entrance. The 'elevator room' drops rapidly.)#
KIRK: Phasers on stun.#
KIRK: A lot of it?#
KIRK: What source?#
KIRK: Or what?#
KIRK: We're slowing down. (The door opens, and there is a woman in yellow in the corridor. She reaches to her wrist band, but Kirk stuns her first. He takes her wrist band.)#
KIRK: Is she all right?#
KIRK: Who's in charge? I wish to speak to him.#
KIRK: What have you done with Spock's brain? Where've you taken it?#
KIRK: You're lying!#
KIRK:  See what you can pick up on your communicator.#
KIRK: We don't want to hurt you. What is this place?#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: Spock, is that you?#
KIRK: Yes, Spock. Yes.#
KIRK: We'll get you, Spock. It won't be long.#
KIRK: Quickly! (They head off down the corridor, Scott controlling Spock's body. Then around a corner comes a woman in purple with two Morg in uniforms.) KIRK: There she is. That's the one. What have you done with Spock's brain? (The woman in purple uses her wrist band to knock out the men. Only Spock is left standing.) Captain's Log, stardate 5431.6. Immediately after making contact with Spock's brain, Doctor McCoy, Engineer Scott, and myself were taken prisoner inside a highly complex civilisation hundreds of metres below the surface of planet Sigma Draconis Seven. The primitive creature we encountered above warned us about the givers of pain and delight and the frightening consequences of being captured by them.#
KIRK: What have you done with Spock's brain?#
KIRK: This is Spock. You saw him on the ship. You have his brain. It must be restored to him immediately. What have you done with it?#
KIRK: I do not know about Luma, but you were on the Enterprise. I saw you.#
KIRK: You came to my ship!#
KIRK: I saw you on my ship.#
KIRK: No, it doesn't.#
KIRK: Sorry. We don't want to hurt anyone.#
KIRK: No. We'll stay here and learn about you and tell you of us.#
KIRK: I wish to talk to those in charge.#
KIRK: Yes, the organisers, the managers. The leader of your people.#
KIRK: Who controls this complex?#
KIRK: Yes, the Controller. The Controller. Who controls? I would like to meet, to see him.#
KIRK: We intend no harm.#
KIRK: No, no, no. I promise you.#
KIRK: Bones. Scotty. Spock's brain controls#
KIRK: Great leader. Great leader!  We come from a far place to learn from your Controller.#
KIRK: He is our friend. You must take us to him. We beg you. Soon it will be too late.#
KIRK: You must take us. (A single press of the green button and they collapse, writhing in agony.)#
KIRK: I never felt anything like that. Every nerve in my body was on fire.#
KIRK: No wonder the Morgs are so obedient, and terrified.#
KIRK: How is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we've met? (Their equipment is laid out on a table, but another Morg stops Kirk getting to it.)#
KIRK: They were smart enough to invent these training devices. What a way to maintain control over a man.#
KIRK: Yes, I certainly did notice those delightful aspects. But that too was strictly under command of the women.#
KIRK: With a communicator, we might be able to find out. This fellow is keeping us from our property.#
KIRK: I certainly think that science might provide an answer.#
KIRK: Agreed, Doctor. (Kirk hits the Morg by the table while Scott and McCoy take on the one by the door. It isn't easy, but finally the Captain triumphs.) KIRK: Science will triumph. Come on, Scotty. Bones, give them something to keep them out for a while.  Spock. Spock. Come on, Spock. Spock, you were on this frequency, Spock.#
KIRK: No. We might be able to locate you, if you gave us some idea of what they were using you for. Is it medical?#
KIRK: Spock, we don't have time for that.#
KIRK: We came to put you back. Where are you?#
KIRK: Back into your body. We brought it along with us.#
KIRK: The skill to remove it exists right where we are. Restoring it must also be possible. That's why we've got to get to you as quickly as we can.#
KIRK: Eighteen hours and twelve minutes.#
KIRK: That leaves us exactly five hours and forty eight minutes, Spock.#
KIRK: Yes. Very brief. That's why we must get to you immediately. Beam us a signal so we can home in on you.#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: Oh, Spock, one question.#
KIRK: We've got pain-giving devices attached to us. Can you tell us how to get them off.#
KIRK: Oh, yes it does, Spock.  Keep concentrating, Spock. Keep concentrating, Spock.#
KIRK: You'll find another Controller.#
KIRK: Spock, you're in a black box tied in with light rays into a complex control panel.#
KIRK: You say you're breathing, pumping blood, maintaining temperature? Is it possible that you're re-circulating air, running heating plants, purifying water?#
KIRK: He will not stay. (He makes Spock release her, and grabs her himself, taking off her bracelet.) Now, you took his brain. You will put it back. How did you do it?#
KIRK: She was on the Enterprise. She must have done it. How did you do it?#
KIRK: How do you get the old knowledge?#
KIRK: What is the Teacher?#
KIRK: How does it work? Show us. KARA; I cannot. KIRK: You must tell us.#
KIRK: How does it work? Show us! We'll protect you.#
KIRK: We're not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing. If you continue, you'll kill Spock.#
KIRK: But Spock will be dead. His body's dying this minute.#
KIRK: No one may kill a man. Not for any purpose. It cannot be condoned.#
KIRK: You must help us. When you came to the ship, you had the knowledge. Yet, when we came here, you didn't.#
KIRK: How long does the knowledge last?#
KIRK: If you had the knowledge, could you restore what you've taken?#
KIRK: You must help us. You must restore with that knowledge what you have taken.#
KIRK: You must put back what you have taken.#
KIRK: Go ahead, Doctor. Put the Teacher on.#
KIRK: No. You won't be destroyed. You'll be without your Controller for the first time, but you'll be much better off, I think.#
KIRK: No, you'll live and develop as you should have. All this shouldn't have been done for you. Now the women here below and the men here above will control together.#
KIRK: There are other ways. You'll discover them. You must move to the surface, you understand.#
KIRK: No, you won't. You'll learn to build houses, to keep warm, to work. We'll help you for a while. Humans have survived under worse conditions. It's a matter of evolution. You'll be fine.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Bones? Bones?#
KIRK: Bones, you can't stop now.#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: You could. A while ago it was child's play. Captain's log, supplemental. Our race against time to save Spock's life may prove futile. Doctor McCoy has lost the surgical knowledge he obtained from the teacher. He has been drawing on his own skills and surgical techniques in an attempt to continue the operation, but he is faltering and uncertain. In a desperate hope that he can draw on Spock's brain for assistance, I instructed Doctor McCoy to give priority to connecting Spock's vocal chords.#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: How do you feel, Spock?#
KIRK: What's that?#
KIRK: Well, we took the risk, Doctor.#
KIRK: Mister Marvick. I am James Kirk, the Captain.#
KIRK: Yes, everything will be taken care of. This is Mister Spock, my First Officer. MARVICK; Oh, yes, you're the Vulcan. It's all right for you to remain, but you, Captain, and this other gentleman.#
KIRK: We mustn't keep the ambassador waiting. If you'll go with Mister Scott, I'm sure the two of you will have a great deal in common.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to transporter control centre on the planet.#
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. Inform the ambassador and Doctor Jones we're ready to beam them aboard. Kirk out. Are you sure this visor will work?#
KIRK: It's your human half I'm worried about.#
KIRK: Inform me when transport is complete. (Kirk leaves. Spock puts on the red filter visor and beams aboard a box and a woman. She removes her visor and gives the Vulcan salute.)#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to all decks.#
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk to all ship's personnel. Clearance plans now in effect.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. Notify all hands to return to stations. All right, let's take her out. Warp factor two.#
KIRK: I can't understand why they let you go with Kollos.#
KIRK: The male population of the Federation. Didn't someone try and talk you out of it?#
KIRK: Well, I'm glad he didn't succeed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you.#
KIRK: Tell me, Doctor Jones. Why isn't it dangerous for you to be with Kollos? Spock I can understand. Nothing makes an impression on him.#
KIRK: You're very welcome, Mister Spock. But no human can look at Kollos, even with a visor, without going mad. How do you manage?#
KIRK: To read minds?#
KIRK: I don't understand.#
KIRK: Oh.#
KIRK: Well, I doubt that Mister Spock would don the most revered of all Vulcan symbols merely to annoy you, Doctor Jones.#
KIRK: Yes, very interesting. I might even say fascinating, but back to your mission. Doctor, do you feel any way may be found to employ Medusan navigators on starships? It would certainly solve many of our navigational problems.#
KIRK: Yes, I think most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness. One of the last of our prejudices. At the risk of sounding prejudiced, gentlemen, here's to beauty.  To Miranda Jones, the loveliest human ever to grace a starship.#
KIRK: Some more Antarean brandy?  What is it?#
KIRK: In this room?#
KIRK: Who is it? Can you tell?#
KIRK: Of course. Perhaps I'll see#
KIRK: Sleep well, Miranda.#
KIRK: Yes, she is something special.#
KIRK: Good night, Scotty. You dressed up for the occasion, Spock. Very impressive.#
KIRK: Good evening. Sleep well.#
KIRK: Bones, what's troubling you with the girl?#
KIRK: I didn't think that for a moment. What else?#
KIRK: We're all vulnerable in one way or another.#
KIRK: Meaning she's quite a woman. I agree.#
KIRK: Good night, Bones.#
KIRK: Miranda!#
KIRK: Miranda?#
KIRK: Has the Ambassador been hurt?#
KIRK: Who could have done such a thing?#
KIRK: Larry Marvick? Why?#
KIRK: Explain, Lieutenant Sulu.#
KIRK: Get engineering, Uhura.#
KIRK: Can't you disengage power from there, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Put them on intercom.#
KIRK: Security to engineering.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Scotty, where are we?#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: All right. All right.#
KIRK: We'll take you to a place to hide.#
KIRK: Where are we?#
KIRK: You mean he just simply died.#
KIRK: Or what he felt. Damage report, Scotty?#
KIRK: Position report, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Then we should be able to navigate back.#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: Hazards?#
KIRK: I could confine her to quarters.#
KIRK: I think that could be arranged.#
KIRK: I may be sentimental, but this is my favourite place. Earth.#
KIRK: Certainly.#
KIRK: Try these.#
KIRK: Let me see. It's just a thorn. I was hoping to make you forget about this today.#
KIRK: You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved you.#
KIRK: But someday, you will want human love and companionship.#
KIRK: Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with the Medusans in order to avoid human emotion?#
KIRK: A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love, Miranda? You're young, attractive and human. Sooner or later, no matter how beautiful their minds are, you're going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself, someone who isn't ugly.#
KIRK: Miranda, I meant no insult. Please. Here we are among the roses. A very romantic setting. I wish there were moonlight, too. Moonlight would suit you very well.#
KIRK: Miranda, don't.#
KIRK: What?#
KIRK: Yes, of course. It's the only reasonable explanation. You can't see and Kollos can't hurt you.#
KIRK: I think I understand. You said it. Pity is the worst of all.#
KIRK: No, that won't be necessary. Mister Spock will make the mind-link. No other decision is possible.#
KIRK: If we can't persuade you, there is someone who can. You'll have to take this up with Kollos. For your own sake.#
KIRK: Bones, why hadn't you told me?#
KIRK: Yes, there's a great deal to respect about that lady. (There's a scream, then Miranda comes out of the room, calm and composed.)#
KIRK: Am I addressing the Ambassador?#
KIRK: We don't hold you to blame for what happened, and thank you now for your help.#
KIRK: Yes. Mister Sulu, release the helm to Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Then go ahead, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Take over, Mister Sulu. Thank you, Ambassador. Mister Chekov, plot a new course.#
KIRK: Ambassador, you must dissolve the link.#
KIRK: There must be no delay.#
KIRK: Spock! Don't look! Cover your eyes!#
KIRK: Don't move!#
KIRK: No one is to move. Spock? Are you all right?#
KIRK:  Vulcan mind techniques. They seem so untrustworthy now that Spock's life is at stake.#
KIRK: But does she want to? She's been in there so long.#
KIRK: She tried to help Marvick. Marvick is dead.#
KIRK: And Spock is her rival. Is that any better? Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy.#
KIRK: Whatever happens, Bones, don't interfere.#
KIRK: Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: No change?#
KIRK: What are you doing about it?#
KIRK: Which doesn't seem to be much.#
KIRK: It's worth a try, isn't it? After all, he's not a machine.#
KIRK: Only half. The other half is human. Far more human than you, apparently.#
KIRK: If you don't reach him soon, he'll die. But that's what you want, isn't it?#
KIRK: Oh yes? You want him to die. What did you do to him on the Bridge? Did you make him forget to put the visor over his eyes?#
KIRK: Yes, you know your rival, don't you? You couldn't keep him from making a mind-link with Kollos, something you couldn't do yourself! With my words, I'll make you hear such ugliness as Spock saw when he looked at Kollos with his naked eyes! The ugliness is within you!#
KIRK: Your desire to see Kollos is madness! You can never see him. Never. But Spock saw Kollos, and for that he must die.#
KIRK: The smell of hatred, the stench of jealousy permeates you. Why don't you strangle him while he lies there?#
KIRK: Kollos knows what's in your heart. You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to Kollos.#
KIRK: Maybe too much.#
KIRK: You may be right, Bones. Maybe I shouldn't have gone in. She was blind, really blind. Really in the dark. And if he dies. If he dies, how do I know that I didn't kill him? How do I know that she can stand to hear the truth?#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: Miranda.#
KIRK: I didn't think you'd even talk to me.#
KIRK: Miranda, good luck, Health. I have something for you.#
KIRK: I never met a rose that didn't.#
KIRK: Peace. (Spock puts on the visor to beam Kollos and Miranda away. Kirk just watches, then leaves.)#
KIRK: Record tape. Maybe it'll tell us something about the personnel that lived here.#
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it, Enterprise?#
KIRK: How bad?#
KIRK: Get that ship out of here. Stay at minimum distance for absolute safety.#
KIRK: Get that ship out of here, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, what about that tape?#
KIRK: Where's does that sound coming from? Spock, can you pinpoint it?#
KIRK: Bones! Spock! (He tries to leave, but falls back into the floor. Then he vanishes too leaving just a body print in the dust.)#
KIRK: Spock. Bones. Where are we?#
KIRK: How did we get here?#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: One of the missing scientists?#
KIRK: Identification?#
KIRK: Let's find out. Phasers on stun.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Be careful.#
KIRK: We're not going to hurt you. Is this your home? Do you live here? What about it, Spock? Analysis.#
KIRK: Are you responsible for bringing us here? Don't be afraid. Bones, what's wrong with her?#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: A race of mutes, like the civilisation on Gamma Vertis Four.#
KIRK: Without speech, how's she going to be able to understand us? Unless she's a telepath.#
KIRK: Do you have any ideas?#
KIRK: I want to know why we're here. I want to know what's going on. And she knows. (Two big-headed aliens in silver robes appear. First cousins to the Talos people, by the looks of them.) KIRK: I'm Captain#
KIRK: Who are you? Why did you bring us here?#
KIRK: What do you intend to do with us?#
KIRK: We come  Since you already know who we are, you must also know that we come in peace. Our prime directive specifically prohibits us from any interference.) (The Vians fire their weapons several times, and the landing party is caught in some sort of enery field. The Vians go to Gem) KIRK: I can't seem to stand up.#
KIRK: Mister Spock there must be an exit other than the one we just saw.#
KIRK: Don't worry about me. They may have hurt her.#
KIRK: Did they hurt you? (Then Gem turns back and touches the cut on Kirk's head. It disappears from him and appears on her forehead instead, then vanishes.) KIRK: The pain is gone. She touched my head, and the pain is gone.#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: Details.#
KIRK: Well they're there now. Let's go check them out.  Staying here alone could be dangerous. Come with us. (The group comes to a collection of computer-like items, girder structures holding up nothing, glass tubes. Herein called 'the laboratory')#
KIRK: Bones Spock, come here. (He has found the scientists, preserved in perspex tubes, in the same positions that they vanished from the research lab.)#
KIRK: I found our missing men. Dead. Another one of your experiments?#
KIRK: Yes. Your time is running out. This sun is about to nova. When it does, it'll destroy you, this planet, and this insane torture chamber.#
KIRK: Let's get out of here.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Out of range. Readings, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Let's get there as fast as we can. If the Enterprise has a search party, it'll be there. (The group run on. Gem isn't very good at running, and McCoy falls over a stone once.) KIRK: Spock! Much further?#
KIRK: Scotty!#
KIRK: Stay there! Come on!#
KIRK: Keep going.#
KIRK: What are you doing here? Where's Scotty?#
KIRK: What about the others?#
KIRK: Very well.#
KIRK: Denied.#
KIRK: You have your orders.#
KIRK: What happened to my men?#
KIRK: One specimen, you said. One specimen! What happened to my men?#
KIRK: Where are they? Tell me! You said you'd let them go!#
KIRK: What is it you want to know?#
KIRK: You don't need any knowledge from us, yet you're willing to kill for it. Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba?#
KIRK: Well, what did you expect from them? And what do you want from me?#
KIRK: Why? What is it you hope to prove? If my death is to have any meaning, at least tell me what I'm dying for.#
KIRK: Will she live?#
KIRK: Can you explain what happened?#
KIRK: She weakened. I could feel it. Is her life in danger?#
KIRK: Could the strain really have killed her?#
KIRK: I'm tired.#
KIRK: I remember the laboratory, and they wanted to know something. But I, I can't remember.#
KIRK: What's the matter with me?#
KIRK: You'll have to ask the Vians. Will I live?#
KIRK: No, he's right. Continue.#
KIRK: Can you tap into it?#
KIRK: And get us out of here the same way we were brought in.#
KIRK: Then I would say proceed.#
KIRK: It is.#
KIRK: We will not co-operate.#
KIRK: How's it coming, Spock?#
KIRK: Take it easy, Bones.#
KIRK: And space travel is?#
KIRK: The decision's mine. If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them. If and when it becomes necessary. (Kirk appears to be in discomfort. McCoy prepares a hypo, and injects him.) KIRK: I don't need any#
KIRK: Why did you let him do it?#
KIRK: Anything?#
KIRK: What exactly is it?#
KIRK: Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern?#
KIRK: Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock. What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it.#
KIRK: And that we would use it to escape.#
KIRK: And they keep McCoy.#
KIRK:  Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this. Even before we got here, she was a prisoner. They didn't hurt her, they didn't even threaten her.#
KIRK: Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen for you?#
KIRK: Will it take us to McCoy?#
KIRK: The best defence is a strong offense, and I intend to start offending right now. Aim for the lab.#
KIRK: Bones. Spock. Get him down. His wrists. His pulse is almost gone. How is he?#
KIRK: Don't talk. Don't speak. Take it easy until we get you back to the ship. What is it? What's the matter?#
KIRK: You don't know. You're not a doctor.#
KIRK: How long?#
KIRK: Can't we do something?#
KIRK: Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could his nearness to death also kill her?#
KIRK: If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death, we might be able to save him. (A forcefield stops them from getting to where Gem is crouching in fear)#
KIRK: She can save his life. Let us help her to go to him.#
KIRK: What purpose can all this serve, except the fulfilment of some need of yours?#
KIRK: Patient? Our friend is dying.#
KIRK: This arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure. Will it prevent this catastrophe?#
KIRK: How will the death of our friend serve this purpose?#
KIRK: We were? What could she learn from us?#
KIRK: Then you cannot let him die.#
KIRK: Yes, Bones.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Yes, I know.#
KIRK: I'll try.#
KIRK: Yes. KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: You must save the life of our friend.#
KIRK: If death is all you understand, here are four lives for you.#
KIRK: We will not leave our friend. You've lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience. You don't understand what it is to live. Love and compassion are dead in you. You're nothing but intellect. (Lal goes over to McCoy and heals him, then picks up the unconscious Gem.)#
KIRK: Strange.#
KIRK: I'm not puzzled, Mister Spock. I am awed.#
KIRK: No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem. I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem.#
KIRK: What, Scott?#
KIRK: Yes, she was all that. And whether the Vians bought her or found her makes little difference. She was of great value.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, ahead warp factor two.#
KIRK: Specify.#
KIRK: What about sensor failure?#
KIRK: How bad is it?#
KIRK: How about it, Spock?#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: The Defiant! Mister Sulu, impulse engines only. Close to transporter range.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency.#
KIRK: Good. Maintain position. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, come with me. Doctor McCoy, report to the transporter room immediately. Scotty, you have the conn.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Use the ship's sensors to locate them. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Prepare to beam over a full security squad on my orders.#
KIRK: Odd, Mister Spock. Very odd. Spock, you stay here with me. Chekov, get down to Engineering and life support systems. Doctor McCoy, check out the Sickbay. Kirk to Enterprise. Cancel the security squad and stand by for further instructions.#
KIRK: Get back up here.#
KIRK: Kirk to McCoy.#
KIRK: Bones, can you tell me what they all died of?#
KIRK: They what?#
KIRK: Could mental disease have infected all of the crew?#
KIRK: Bones, what is it? Answer me!#
KIRK: Answer me!#
KIRK: Get up here on the double.#
KIRK: You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the Enterprise?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, stand by to beam us back.#
KIRK: Why not? What's happened?#
KIRK: Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation. You, too, Spock.#
KIRK: Request denied.#
KIRK: I know what the chances are. Mister Spock, don't argue. Get back with the information. I'll be right there. Scotty, energise transporter.#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: I had a whole universe to myself after the Defiant was thrown out. There was absolutely no one else in it. I must say I prefer a crowded universe much better. How did you two get along without me?#
KIRK: Good. No problems between you?#
KIRK: Try me.#
KIRK: Which humans, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Ah, yes. I understand. Well, I hope my last orders were helpful in solving any problems that you don't feel worth reporting.#
KIRK: My last orders. The last orders that I left for both of you. The last taped orders.#
KIRK: Good. Good. Well, I hope we won't have similar opportunities to test those orders which you never heard. Ahead warp factor two, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Missile spread, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Anything on communications, Lieutenant Uhura?#
KIRK: Course of the missile, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Prepare phaser banks one and two, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, get a fix on the missile's point of origin.#
KIRK: Fire phasers.  Mister Chekov, alter course to the missile's point of origin.#
KIRK: Warp factor three, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: What's the emergency?#
KIRK: That was quite a scene.#
KIRK: Excellent. What's the emergency?#
KIRK: Serious?#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Who?#
KIRK: Who is it?#
KIRK: You.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Confirm Chekov's co-ordinates for the missile's point of origin.#
KIRK: That object on the screen?#
KIRK: Could the enemy vessel be hiding behind the asteroid?#
KIRK: Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin.#
KIRK: Full sensor probe, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: How could that be? Unless it's powered. A spaceship?#
KIRK: Source of power?#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, plot the course of the asteroid vessel.#
KIRK: Yes?#
KIRK: Daran Five? Inhabited?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, match Enterprise speed with that of the asteroid vessel. Mister Spock and I are transporting aboard. Mister Scott, you have the conn.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and I will handle this.#
KIRK: All right, Doctor. If that's what you want.#
KIRK: Wouldn't know this was a spaceship. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Transported without incident. Kirk out. (They go exploring and see large tubular structures sticking out of the ground.) KIRK: No apparent opening.#
KIRK: Of a sort. Weapons, communication devices. Let me go to my friend.#
KIRK: You all right?#
KIRK: I can't say I think much of your welcome.#
KIRK: They've been in flight ten thousand years. Maybe they don't realise it.#
KIRK: I am Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my medical officer, Doctor McCoy. My first officer, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: We've come in friendship.#
KIRK: Spock.  Doctor McCoy. Bones. Bones?#
KIRK: No, that's not it.#
KIRK: You're right, Spock. The shock was serious because of McCoy's weakened condition.#
KIRK: I don't think he would've told you himself, but I think you should know now. It's xenopolycythemia.#
KIRK: Then you know that nothing can be done.#
KIRK: Bones, how is it?#
KIRK: Spock knows.#
KIRK: Are you in any condition to get up?#
KIRK: No. The people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge, but it's better than exterminating them.#
KIRK: And the three billion on Daran Five.#
KIRK: No, we're from outside your world.#
KIRK: Up there. Outside, up there, everywhere.#
KIRK: Why is it forbidden?#
KIRK: What is it, Bones?#
KIRK: For the world is hollow, and I have touched the sky.#
KIRK: Yes, of course it is, because if you did you'd touch the sky and find out that you were living on a big ball. Not a planet, but a spaceship. And that knowledge seems to be forbidden.#
KIRK: We don't know. He just suddenly screamed in pain and died.#
KIRK: You seem to be the special favourite.#
KIRK: Personally, I find the lady's taste questionable, but she obviously prefers you, and you obviously don't seem to mind. If you could arrange to be alone with the young lady, Spock and I would be left alone to find the power controls of this world.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. To our good friends of Yonada.#
KIRK: Good. Then you wouldn't mind if we looked around?#
KIRK: Thank you. And thank you for taking care of Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I wonder how many generations have lived out their lives and been buried here without ever knowing that their world is hollow.#
KIRK: The problem, to get in.#
KIRK: Fabrini? Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets?#
KIRK: Some of them must have been put aboard this ship and sent to another planet. And these are their descendants. (Once the coast is clear.) Now.#
KIRK: The Oracle doesn't seem to know we're here. I wonder what alerted it the first time.#
KIRK: I think you're right. Continue investigating. The clue to the location of the control room must be around here somewhere.#
KIRK: This plaque is a representation of a star and its solar system.#
KIRK: Then there's no doubt these people are the descendants of the Fabrini.#
KIRK: You're returning with us?#
KIRK: Bones, this isn't a planet. It's a space ship on a collision course with Daran Five.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I order you to return with us.#
KIRK: Bones, if we can't correct the course of this ship, we'll have to blast it out of space.#
KIRK: As her husband?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: We're beaming over. Lock in on our signal.#
KIRK: And transport Mister Spock and myself immediately.#
KIRK: He's staying, Scotty. Kirk out.#
KIRK: That is the problem, sir.#
KIRK: Yes. Those are the orders.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Put him on.#
KIRK: Yes, Bones.#
KIRK: You've located the controls?#
KIRK: Where is it?#
KIRK: Bones, are you all right?#
KIRK: Help him.#
KIRK: Spock, take care of McCoy. (Kirk drags Natira away so Spock can remove the Instrument of Obedience.)#
KIRK: We have freed him from the cruelty of your Oracle.#
KIRK: Bones. Bones. You said something about a book. Where is it?#
KIRK: Now listen to me. You must listen to what I have to say. Give me one moment to speak to you. One moment. Natira, if you don't believe what I'm about to tell you, you can call the guards. We'll accept any punishment you decree.#
KIRK: You must believe that what I'm about to tell you is the truth.#
KIRK: Yes, my world and your world of Yonada.#
KIRK: I understand. I understand, Natira. Ten thousand years ago, a sun was dying and with it, its world. It's the world you see on the plaque in the room of the Oracle.#
KIRK: No. It is the world of your ancestors, your creators. It no longer exists.#
KIRK: No, I'm not. Now listen to me! Hear me out. When your ancestors discovered that their world was dying they built a great ship and chose their best people. They wished for their race to survive. They sent the ship out into space.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: No. You are living inside a hollow ball. Your ancestors created it to take you on a journey to a promised new planet.#
KIRK: Because a flaw developed in the controls. And unless we correct it, Yonada will kill millions of people and destroy a world it doesn't even know.#
KIRK: Let us remove the instrument of obedience, the way we did for McCoy. Natira.#
KIRK: Do you think she understood me?#
KIRK: Is she all right?#
KIRK: We do this for the survival of the people of Yonada.#
KIRK: We mean no desecration to the faith of Yonada. We must consult the book to help you.#
KIRK: McCoy, how do you open this thing?#
KIRK: Here. The plan must be in there. Is it indexed?#
KIRK: Hurry, Spock.#
KIRK: Let's get her out of the heat.#
KIRK: Active and functional. Not too different from the Enterprise.#
KIRK: Enough to turn it off course?#
KIRK: Good. Going back to marked headings.#
KIRK: Steadying on course marked in red.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, the Fabrini descendants are scheduled to debark on their promised planet in approximately three hundred and ninety days. I think that we could manage to be in that vicinity at that time, if you wanted to thank the Fabrini personally.#
KIRK: Report, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Life readings, Doctor McCoy?#
KIRK: An entire human colony, a whole settlement. One hundred men, women and children. Who did it? And why?  Kirk here.#
KIRK: Total reply if attacked. So that's the answer. Klingons.#
KIRK: Maintain Red Alert. (The Klingons arrive, and their leader hits Kirk with his disruptor, knocking him down.)#
KIRK: We took no action against your ship, Kang.#
KIRK: There was a Federation colony on this planet. It was destroyed.#
KIRK: Yes, a test of a new Klingon weapon, leaving no traces. Federation ships don't specialise in sneak attacks.#
KIRK: You received a distress call? We received a distress call.#
KIRK: Go to the devil.#
KIRK: Chekov! Stop the torture!#
KIRK: Help Chekov.#
KIRK: I'll beam you aboard the Enterprise. Once there, no tricks.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, we have guests. Adjust transporter to wide field. Beam up everyone in the target area.#
KIRK: Full security, Johnson, on the double.#
KIRK: Good work, Spock.#
KIRK: Klingons.#
KIRK: Johnson?#
KIRK: Bring them in.#
KIRK: I said no tricks after we reach the ship. You're a prisoner of the Federation of Planets against which you may or may not have committed an act of war.#
KIRK: Prepare to destruct.#
KIRK: You wouldn't be standing here if I had.#
KIRK: Apparently you have a few things to learn about us. Detain them in the crew lounge. Programme the food synthesiser to accommodate our guests. You'll be well-treated, Kang.#
KIRK: Secure from Red Alert.#
KIRK: But maintain general quarters. Scan this sector for other ships. Run a full check on the colony. I want this thing nailed down fast.#
KIRK: No proof that Klingons committed it.#
KIRK: Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that they will be believed.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: Keep trying. We've got a diplomatic tiger by the tail.#
KIRK: Very good, Scotty. Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Fire phasers.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, change course to seventeen mark four, warp factor three.#
KIRK: Sulu?#
KIRK: Override.#
KIRK: Scotty, stop all engines.#
KIRK: Scotty!#
KIRK: New course?#
KIRK: That'll take us out of the galaxy.#
KIRK: Johnson. Get down to Security. Search every section. Some Klingons may have beamed aboard undetected from the wrecked ship. Then get down to Engineering and help Scotty hammer things back to normal. And free those trapped crewmen.  And before I put you in the brig, there's a little something I owe you. (He punches Kang. A solitaire set on a table changes into a short sword which Kang picks up. A potted plant and 3D chess set become swords.) KIRK: Phasers. (But they turn into swords too. There's a stunned pause then a brief fight as the Starfleet group get out of the room.) KIRK; Out!#
KIRK: Sickbay.#
KIRK: Bridge.#
KIRK: The Klingons are free. They're armed as we are. They'll try to take the ship. Scotty, how many men do we have?#
KIRK: Deploy forces to protect your section and the auxiliary control centre.#
KIRK: Blow out the bulkheads if you have to. We need numbers. What kind of luck have you had controlling the ship's speed?#
KIRK: Full sensor scan of the ship. Report on any movement by the Klingons. The Klingon Empire has maintained a duelling tradition. They think they can beat us with swords.#
KIRK: Any other logical candidate?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu. Get below. Take command of Engineering and auxiliary control.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, as you were. Chekov!#
KIRK: This is no time for a vendetta. Maintain your post.#
KIRK: Chekov, maintain your post!#
KIRK: His only brother, killed in a Klingon raid.#
KIRK: Sulu, get down to Engineering.#
KIRK: Security, this is the captain. Find Mister Chekov and bring him to the bridge.#
KIRK: I don't know, but he does. And now he wants revenge for a non-existent loss.#
KIRK: Get back to Engineering. Try to re-establish engine control, and talk to ordnance about manufacturing phaser replacements.#
KIRK: What the blazes is going on?#
KIRK: Constant surveillance, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Could more Klingons have beamed aboard?#
KIRK: An alien life force. We must make contact, find out what it wants.#
KIRK: A brother that never existed, a phantom colony, imaginary distress calls, the creation of these weapons. Do you sense a pattern, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: And now it has control of the Enterprise and taking us out of the galaxy. But why?#
KIRK: We must talk to Kang, bury the hatchet.#
KIRK: McCoy?#
KIRK: The alien is the real threat. That's the enemy we have to wipe out.#
KIRK: Kang, there's something important I must discuss with you.#
KIRK:  The Enterprise is heading out of our galaxy, controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship. Engineering has been taken over by Klingons who have cut off life-support systems. Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Get down to emergency manual control. Try to protect our life-support circuits and auxiliary power.#
KIRK: Scotty, I'm glad you've come.#
KIRK: Scotty?#
KIRK: Scotty, take it easy.#
KIRK: Gentlemen!  Spock! Scotty. Spock. Spock! Stop it! You're half human! What are we saying? What are we doing to each other?#
KIRK: We've been under stress before. It's never set us at each other's throats.#
KIRK: There isn't any war! Or is there?#
KIRK: Scotty. What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in other terms than war. We've been trained to fight its causes, if necessary. Then why are we behaving like a group of savages? Look at me. Look at me. Two forces aboard this ship, each of them equally armed. Has a war been staged for us, complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating? Even, Spock, even race hatred?#
KIRK: But what's the game? And whose? And what are the rules?#
KIRK: Yes. Mister Sulu, report.#
KIRK: We're getting something.#
KIRK: Start scanning. Let's find that alien.#
KIRK: Let's go.#
KIRK: Chekov!#
KIRK: What have I done?  There's an alien entity aboard the ship. It's forcing us to fight. We don't want to. We don't know what its motive is. We're trying to find out. You must help us. Take me to Kang. A temporary truce, that's all I ask. Spock, take her.#
KIRK: Chekov. Chekov.  Is this what's in store for us, from here on in? Violence, hatred.#
KIRK: He lost control. So did I. We're becoming animal warriors. Let's go, Spock.#
KIRK: Why? So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum? What's next, the roar of crowds?#
KIRK: Let's find the alien.  You come with us. Maybe we can prove to you that it exists. {Corridor] (The weird light is up ahead of them and glowing red.) KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: What do you want? What are you doing here?#
KIRK: Duty? Did McCoy release you from Sickbay?#
KIRK: Then get back to Sickbay!#
KIRK: I order you#
KIRK: Johnson!#
KIRK: It subsists on the emotions of others.#
KIRK: It exists on the hate of others.#
KIRK: And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence. It's got to have a vulnerable area. We've got to get rid of it.#
KIRK: Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies, filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare. Kang has got to listen. We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing. (goes to intercom) Kang. Kang, this is Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: Kang.  He won't answer.#
KIRK: Time factor?#
KIRK: Well, do whatever you can. Kirk out.#
KIRK: And so we drift in space, with only hatred and bloodshed aboard. Now do you believe? Captain's log, stardate Armageddon. We must find a way to defeat the alien force of hate that has taken over the Enterprise. Stop the war now, or spend eternity in futile bloody violence.#
KIRK: If I could talk to Kang, somehow cut through the Klingon lines, make peace before it's too late.#
KIRK: Kang! Kang, this is Captain Kirk.#
KIRK: She has five seconds to live. Reply.#
KIRK: He called my bluff.#
KIRK: The Federation doesn't kill or mistreat its prisoners. You've been listening to propaganda, fables. How much time?#
KIRK: We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all.#
KIRK: There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help.#
KIRK: How?#
KIRK: We can't get through the Klingon defences in time, unless. Spock. Intra-ship beaming from one section to another. It's possible?#
KIRK: We're all in a trap. This is the only way out.#
KIRK: No. That'd start the final battle. I believe her. Prepare the transporter. We'll wait for your signal.#
KIRK: I hope your computations are correct, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Mara. Before you start killing, give me one minute.#
KIRK: Nobody wins. Have any more of your men died? We can't be killed. There's an alien aboard. It wants us alive.#
KIRK: Look! Look, Kang. For the rest of our lives. A thousand lifetimes. Senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total control over us.#
KIRK: All right. All right. In the heart. In the head. I won't stay dead. Next time I'll do the same to you. I'll kill you. And it goes on, the good old game of war, pawn against pawn! Stopping the bad guys. While somewhere, something sits back and laughs and starts it all over again.#
KIRK: Be a pawn, be a toy, be a good soldier that never questions orders.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura.#
KIRK: Put me on ship-wide intercom.#
KIRK: Kang.#
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. A truce is ordered. The fighting is over. Lay down your weapons.#
KIRK: Get off my ship. You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We know about you, and we don't want to play. Maybe there are others like you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over. We'll be on guard now, ready for you. So ship out! Come on! Haul it!#
KIRK: That's right. (The huge shadow is an optical illusion. The person who walks in is a dwarf with a normal voice.)#
KIRK: Who are the inhabitants of this planet?#
KIRK: Bones, I can't understand why a simple cut like that could become so serious.#
KIRK: This psychokinetic power of yours, how long have you had it?#
KIRK: That's why you have no resistance?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Engines at full speed. Get her out of orbit and into space.#
KIRK: Then there's nothing you can do but batten down and weather.#
KIRK: Parmen's mind is not (something flies past them very fast) Watch it! He's not only throwing around furniture, he's tearing up the Enterprise as well. Bones, knock him out fast. (McCoy tries to give the injection, but gets flung away by Parmen's mind. Alexander gets jerked around too.)#
KIRK: Alexander. Stand behind me.#
KIRK: Hurry up with that shot!#
KIRK: Bones! Shake him. Break his concentration.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Good. I think you'll find the orbit lock is broken as well. Assess damage and repair whatever is necessary.#
KIRK: No thanks is necessary.#
KIRK: Oh, thank you, we must return to the ship.#
KIRK: Well, in that case, we'll stay.#
KIRK: Thank you, Alexander.#
KIRK: Tell me what?#
KIRK: Where is everyone?#
KIRK: Alexander, are there other Platonians like you?#
KIRK: Who don't have the psychokinetic ability.#
KIRK: Don't worry about it. We're happy without it.#
KIRK: Alexander, where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference, and nobody has the power.#
KIRK: That might not be easy should Parmen die.#
KIRK: Yes. This utopia of theirs is one of the best-kept secret in the galaxy. Screening themselves from our sensors, locking us into orbit. All this adds up to a pattern.#
KIRK: If ever there was a time to get out of here, it is now. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, come in.#
KIRK: The turbulence hit you that hard?#
KIRK: Did you get up into space?#
KIRK: All right, Scotty. I'll handle it down here. Stand by.#
KIRK: Your Excellency.#
KIRK: I would like to know why the ship's instrumentation and weaponry is frozen, and why the Enterprise is locked in orbit.#
KIRK: Parmen, I've talked to the engineer aboard the ship. We've showed our good faith. Now you show yours. I want this ship released immediately.#
KIRK: Guests? You don't know the meaning of the word. Guests aren't treated like common prisoners.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Enterprise, come in. Enterprise. I can't raise them.#
KIRK: No, Mister Spock. One thing for certain. Parmen is not concerned with my dignity or safety.#
KIRK: Where are you going?#
KIRK: Has the Enterprise been released yet?#
KIRK: Certainly. Has the Enterprise been released yet?#
KIRK: Then good day, and thank you for the presents.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy saved your life.#
KIRK: And you consider yourself a disciple of Plato?#
KIRK: And if his mind isn't strong enough, he gets torn apart like Alexander.#
KIRK: We don't use our weapons for the kind of brutality you practice.#
KIRK: Come on, Doctor. McCoy.#
KIRK: No. You're the doctor. They don't want to force you. They need your goodwill. They're trying#
KIRK: We're not leaving until McCoy is released.#
KIRK: I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.#
KIRK: You're not staying, McCoy. No matter what he tries to#
KIRK: Being your slave, what should I do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend, nor services to do, till you#
KIRK: McCoy. No matter what he makes me say or do, the answer's no.#
KIRK: Is this your utopia, your grand vision of the future? You don't even#
KIRK: Spock. Spock. Don't let them break you. Hold on. Don't#
KIRK: Can you do anything for him?#
KIRK: My muscles are sore, that's all.#
KIRK: Which just goes to prove that there's no such thing as a perfect solution.#
KIRK: Yes, Spock.#
KIRK: Great anger.#
KIRK: You can't.#
KIRK: Promised? Parmen? He'd let us beam up to the Enterprise, and plunge the ship back into the atmosphere.#
KIRK: Because, if he killed us outright in front of you, you'd retaliate. You're a doctor. You have the means. Bones, I know you're trying to do the right thing, but if any one of us escaped, Parmen knows Starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished. Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay, and you sign our death warrant.#
KIRK: Put it down.#
KIRK: Put it down. Do what I say.#
KIRK: Give it to me!#
KIRK: In that case, what's the point in you dying too, Alexander? Give it to me.#
KIRK: That's all right. It's all right, Alexander. Listen, we haven't given up, and there may be something you can do to help.#
KIRK: All right. Did the Platonians always have this power?#
KIRK: Bones, I think it'd be a good idea if you took a reading of Alexander's blood.#
KIRK: You still have a tricorder reading of Parmen's blood, don't you?#
KIRK: And if our theory works out, we've got a weapon.#
KIRK: Kironide. It's a high-energy source. That could be it.#
KIRK: Exactly. McCoy, there must be a quick way of building up a concentration of kironide in our blood.#
KIRK: What are we waiting for?#
KIRK: What is it, Bones?#
KIRK: Yes. There are thirty eight of them.#
KIRK: Let's not any waste time. Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream.#
KIRK: Yes. What about Alexander?#
KIRK: Why not? You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet.#
KIRK: Alexander.#
KIRK: Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura. (The women try to speak, but no sound comes. Then they turn and leave the room.) KIRK: I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining.#
KIRK: Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot?#
KIRK: So did l. Let's try a simple test. Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit. Nothing. (Shutters draw back to reveal their audience, the Platonians and McCoy.)#
KIRK: Not yet, Parmen. You have to convince the doctor first.#
KIRK: That's the way they want you to feel. It makes them think that they're alive.#
KIRK: Try not to think of them. Try.#
KIRK: You're half dead, all of you! You've been dead for centuries. We may disappear tomorrow, but at least we're living now, and you can't stand that, can you? You're half crazy because there's nothing inside. Nothing. And you have to torture us to convince yourselves you're superior. (Kirk cracks the whip in front of Uhura's face. Alexander creeps away.);#
KIRK:  I did.#
KIRK: Platonians, listen to me. The next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt. Not only do we have your psychokinetic abilities, but at twice your power level.#
KIRK: Do you want to be like him? (Alexander puts down the knife by his own choice. Parmen is dragged out of his seat.)#
KIRK: To us, killing is murder, even for revenge. But there will be other starships.#
KIRK: I don't believe you.#
KIRK: Just remember, we can recreate that power in a matter of hours, so don't try anything.#
KIRK: You're very good at making speeches, Parmen. Just make sure that this one sinks in. Now move aside. Alexander. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, prepare to beam us up. I have a little surprise for you. I'm bringing a visitor aboard.#
KIRK: What do your sensors read?#
KIRK: Specify.#
KIRK: You do that. Lieutenant Uhura, does the location of the distress call correspond with this area#
KIRK: Well, apart from the landing party, there's no one here. There are no Scalosians.#
KIRK: Check circuits for malfunctions. Kirk out.#
KIRK: When we've run analysis, we should have some explanation. (waves away a buzz) But there is an insect life.#
KIRK: It registers in my ears. Nothing, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: No sign of present life?#
KIRK: Something was here. We saw them on the screen. Lieutenant Uhura is still getting a distress call. What happened?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, I want you to run a survey, a complete survey of the planet using all ship's available instruments.#
KIRK: What happened? MCCOY; I was looking at him. I was looking right at him, and he. And he just wasn't there!#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, start a replay of the distress call. Scotty, are the transporter controls functioning now?#
KIRK: No, he's in Sickbay. Doctor McCoy is running a check on the landing party. What is it, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, I would like#
KIRK: Have repair crews been assigned?#
KIRK: Play it.#
KIRK: Freeze it.#
KIRK: The fact remains, when we beamed down there we couldn't find these people. They were there, now they're not. Nor is Crewman Compton.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, I want the ship on standby alert while we continue the investigation.#
KIRK: Scotty, assist. KIRK: Mister Spock, ever since we beamed up from Scalos, we've had a series of malfunctions. I want an investigation and an explanation.#
KIRK: Can't it wait, Bones?#
KIRK: What do you read so far?#
KIRK: On my way. Mister Spock, you have the conn.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Anything missing?#
KIRK: Thank you.#
KIRK: That fits in with other disturbances. Bones, what did your readings show up on the other men?#
KIRK: Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming?#
KIRK: Hold on. Bones, could something be making me hallucinate?#
KIRK: I mean that twice before something touched me, and there was nothing there. And it's just happened again. Could I be imagining it?#
KIRK: But am I hallucinating?#
KIRK: Then we did beam something aboard. Something has invaded the ship. Kirk to Spock. Come in. Spock, come in.#
KIRK: Spock, I can't hear you. Check your circuits. Is there a malfunction?#
KIRK: Lieutenant, ship wide order. Use communicators instead of intercom. Issue phasers to all crew members. Spock, repeat.#
KIRK: Meet me there on the double.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Phasers on stun. Sweep the area. (The corridor goes green as they fire. Then they all walk forward, but the two security men are stopped again by the force field.)#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Hooked into the life support. Designed to affect it.#
KIRK: Disconnect it.  Destroy it. (Their phasers disappear from their hands, then they are pushed backwards.) KIRK: That was no force field. Something shoved me back. They're in here. You! What are you doing on my ship? Show yourselves!#
KIRK: A show of strength.#
KIRK: Have your readings been fed into the computer?#
KIRK: Read out.#
KIRK: We will not negotiate. Do you concur?#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Yeoman, is that coffee available, or have those circuits been damaged as well?  My recommendation? Make them take the next step. (Kirk hears that buzzing again. We see his coffee bubble briefly. He takes a drink, grimaces  then everything around him slows down and finally stops.) KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: Would you mind explaining  Who are you?#
KIRK: You're the enemy?#
KIRK: What have you done with my men?#
KIRK: Nothing? Mister Spock? Scotty. This is nothing?#
KIRK: Lieutenant. Sulu. This is nothing?#
KIRK: What have you done?#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: Deela. Is this why you sabotaged my ship?#
KIRK: You said we?#
KIRK: What about my ship? My crew?#
KIRK:  This won't kill you, but the stun effect is not very pleasant.#
KIRK: If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights? Take out that device in the life-support system?#
KIRK: Compton, did they accelerate you?#
KIRK: They hooked something into the life support system. They're in there. We've got to get rid of it.#
KIRK: By whose order?#
KIRK: I'm your commander, Compton. I order you to let me in.#
KIRK: Who is? Deela? Is that who you're working for?#
KIRK: All right, Compton.#
KIRK: What is that device doing on my ship?#
KIRK: Approve of it? We're your prisoners.#
KIRK: He was so young.#
KIRK: This is what you have planned for us?#
KIRK: Kirk to Spock, I have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks.#
KIRK: Hyperacceleration is the key. I have counted only five of them aboard, but they have taken over the ship, and we are under their control due to this acceleration. They are able to speed others up to their level, as they did Compton and me. Presumably, this is enslavement? Those so treated exist at this accelerated level, becoming docile eventually. But when#
KIRK: Damaged, they age incredibly fast, as though accelerated living#
KIRK: Burns them out. Compton was burned out. The device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze for purposes only the Scalosians know.#
KIRK: The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative.#
KIRK: Why are you doing this?#
KIRK: I really want to know.#
KIRK: What about the rest of my crew?#
KIRK: Not by killing others.#
KIRK: You invaded my ship. You threaten my crew.#
KIRK: There is a difference! Your trouble is in you.#
KIRK: Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way? Deela, have your scientists disconnect, destroy that unit. I promise you, we'll use every skill we have to help you. We'll move you to another planet. We'll call on the most brilliant minds in our Federation to help. We'll do it#
KIRK: I panicked.#
KIRK: I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended animation device.#
KIRK: It was working before. Try it again.#
KIRK: The technicians reported a loss of power. That must be it.#
KIRK: Yes, of course.#
KIRK: I believe in honest relationships myself.#
KIRK: A room should reflect its occupant.#
KIRK: Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look.#
KIRK: A bit.#
KIRK: But now. (He kisses her, then takes her hands but she dodges away. He was trying to get the weapon from her sleeve.)#
KIRK: Was I too crude?#
KIRK: Yes. I know.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Yes, I hope so.#
KIRK: I said I hoped I behaved correctly.#
KIRK: Why are we here?#
KIRK: Oh, yes. That was wrong of me.#
KIRK: But we are going to Scalos?#
KIRK: Oh, yes.#
KIRK: They'll be all right.#
KIRK: What's the matter?#
KIRK: Am I behaving incorrectly?#
KIRK: Those are undesirable qualities.#
KIRK: I'm sorry.#
KIRK: We could put you in suspended animation until we determine what to do with you.#
KIRK: No, it doesn't. What do you want us to do with you?#
KIRK: If I sent you to Scalos, you'd undoubtedly play the same trick on the next spaceship that passed by.#
KIRK: Yes, I suppose it would.#
KIRK: And very brief.#
KIRK: Oh, no. I can think of nothing I'd rather do than stay with you. Except staying alive.#
KIRK: Energise.#
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock, what have you got?#
KIRK: Let's test it.  Nothing's happening.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Out of the nowhere into the here.#
KIRK: Scotty. Captain's log, Stardate 5710.9. Mister Spock has remained in accelerated time so that he might repair the ship more rapidly.#
KIRK: I think we've located Mister Spock. Lieutenant, are your circuits clearing?#
KIRK: Cancel Red Alert, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Open all channels. Captain to crew. Repairs are now being effected by Mister Spock. The ship will resume normal operations almost immediately.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, my compliments to your repair work and yourself.#
KIRK: Yes. No malfunctions anywhere? (sees the Scalosians on the viewscreen) Lieutenant.#
KIRK: That's no malfunction.#
KIRK: Goodbye Deela.#
KIRK: A ghost planet?#
KIRK: Let's take the facts one by one. That should explain something.#
KIRK: Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon.#
KIRK: That would be difficult to explain.#
KIRK: And yet it has.#
KIRK: But a fascinating one, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: It would bear closer investigation, it would seem, if we're to provide Starfleet with an accurate report. Lieutenant, send Doctor McCoy to the transporter room for survey party. We'll also need Senior Geologist D'Amato.#
KIRK: Feed beam down co-ordinates to the transporter room. Mister Sulu, you'll accompany me. Mister Spock, you have the conn.#
KIRK: This expedition should be a geologist's dream, Mister D'Amato.#
KIRK: Yes. If Mister Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle the Fifth Interstellar Geophysical Conference.#
KIRK: A planet that even Spock can't explain. Prepare to transport. Energise. (But just as they start to disintegrate, a woman appears in the transporter room)#
KIRK: That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt.#
KIRK: I don't know. Any more like that and they'll tear this planet apart.#
KIRK: Could seismic stress have accounted for it?#
KIRK: That's very strange. And that woman. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. The shock may have damaged it.#
KIRK: For one thing it means we're stranded.#
KIRK: Shall we stop guessing, Mister Sulu, and try and establish a pattern? I get no readings of high energy concentration. If the Enterprise had blown up, it would have left a high residual radiation.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, if I'd wanted a Russian history lesson, I'd have brought along Mister Chekov. This is a matter of survival, gentlemen. Without the Enterprise, we need food, and we need water, and we need them fast. I want a detailed analysis made of this planet, and I want it now.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Your report covers all vegetation?#
KIRK: Yes. I don't see any water, but there must be some to grow the vegetation. A source of water would stretch our survival. Did you see any evidence of rainfall?#
KIRK: But there is earth-type vegetation.#
KIRK: Yes, that's possible. There's also the possibility of underground water.#
KIRK: This apparently is going to be our home for as long as we last. I suggest we find out as much as we can about it. Split up. D'Amato, see if you can find underground water.#
KIRK: Sulu, run an atmospheric analysis.#
KIRK: Bones, see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite. How do they get their moisture? If you can discover how they survive, maybe we can. (Sulu and D'Amato have headed off to do their analyses. Sulu contacts Kirk on his communicator)#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Kirk out. (Elsewhere, D'Amato is wandering amongst the purple tipped vegetation and picking up handfuls of sand. He turns around and there is the woman.)#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: What do you mean just there?#
KIRK: As though a door opened and closed.#
KIRK: What direction?#
KIRK: Hang on. D'Amato's section. Come in. Kirk to D'Amato. Come in. Come in. Bones, Sulu, D'Amato doesn't answer.#
KIRK: Bones!#
KIRK: Digging a grave.#
KIRK: There are no good ways, Sulu. (Kirk phasers the ground, but it only cuts a shallow trench in the soil.)#
KIRK: My phaser didn't cut through it.#
KIRK: Eight thousand degrees centigrade. It looks like igneous rock, but infinitely denser.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is. I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what you can find out.#
KIRK: Yeah. It might be the most suitable memorial at that.#
KIRK: I don't know, but something or someone did.#
KIRK: We've got to figure this out and devise a defence against it. Is it possible that the rocks have life?#
KIRK: Unless we're dealing with beings, intelligent beings who can shield themselves.#
KIRK: That's the problem, Sulu. We have only questions. No answers.#
KIRK: Except for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments, this planet has no magnetic field. The apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years. No known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time.#
KIRK: The planet might be hollow. They might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes. It's dark. Let's get some rest. Tomorrow we have to find some food and some water or it's going to be a very unpleasant stay.#
KIRK: All right. Take D'Amato's tricorder. Set it for automatic distress. You never can tell.#
KIRK: Hold it! Who are you?#
KIRK: How can you destroy others and not me?#
KIRK: Who are you? Why are you trying to kill us?#
KIRK: Are there men on this planet?#
KIRK: No!#
KIRK: Bones, did you see that? Maybe Spock was wrong. Perhaps this is a ghost planet.#
KIRK: Yes, I know.#
KIRK: That's a good question. She touched the transporter chief. He collapsed immediately. She apparently got to D'Amato. We saw what happened to him. The question is, why are you alive?#
KIRK: The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure. Sulu's alive because I intervened. But that raises an even worse question.#
KIRK: She's not through yet.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move about?#
KIRK: Is he, Bones?#
KIRK: All right. Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time. If I'm correct, when she re-appears, the other two might protect the one she's after by interposing their bodies. No weapons seem to affect her.#
KIRK: Controls are fused. Drop!#
KIRK: Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us. Come on, let's go.#
KIRK: Yes. Like a door opening.#
KIRK: Who have you come for this time?#
KIRK: Why do you want to kill us?#
KIRK: Then why do you want to kill me?#
KIRK: We're here on a peaceful mission. It's you who have killed our people. We mean no harm to you. We want to leave, peacefully.#
KIRK: An android?#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: Commander of what?#
KIRK: Station? Station? Where? How do you feel about killing me?#
KIRK: Stay between us.#
KIRK: You want to kill me?#
KIRK: Then why do it if you don't want to?#
KIRK: By whom?#
KIRK: Are there others on this planet?#
KIRK: How long have you been alone? Are you lonely?#
KIRK: And there's this power surge, right off the scale. Like a door closing. It must be near here.#
KIRK: Right off the scale. It's remained at a peak ever since she disappeared. The entrance is here.#
KIRK: It certainly looks like it. And the invitation doesn't exactly relax me.#
KIRK: I agree.#
KIRK: I don't know. But whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there. And without the Enterprise, gentlemen, the only source of food and water is in there. Let's go.#
KIRK: Who have you come for? Form a circle. You see? You'd better tell us. Tell us. Who have you come for? Who have you come for? You're a very determined woman. For me?#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I need your help.#
KIRK: We've seen the results of your touch.#
KIRK: That is how you kill. You'll never reach me.#
KIRK: That computer must be programming these replicas.#
KIRK: Shift positions.#
KIRK: Spock, the computer! Destroy it!#
KIRK: Mister Spock, I certainly am glad to see you. I thought you and the Enterprise had been destroyed.#
KIRK: Returned from where?#
KIRK: Was, Mister Spock. Its defences were run by computer.#
KIRK: There were replicas of one of them. But that power to recreate them has been destroyed.#
KIRK: Well, you wouldn't have thought so, Mister Spock, if you'd been among us.#
KIRK: The computer was too perfect. It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing. That bought us the time we needed to destroy it. She must have been a remarkable woman.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Five to beam up. I don't agree with you, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Beauty survives.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, our estimated time of arrival for Ariannus?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, advise the planet's ministry of health that we'll begin decontamination procedures immediately upon locking into orbit.#
KIRK: Scotty, will that present any problems for you?#
KIRK: Is it within visual range?#
KIRK: Put it on the screen, extreme magnification.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact them on command frequency two.#
KIRK: Try all frequencies.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Sulu, activate tractor beams.#
KIRK: Prepare to bring it aboard the hangar deck.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, send a security team to the pressure doors on the hangar deck.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, come with me. Scotty.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Acknowledged. (As the shuttlecraft turns around, NCC 1701/7 is clearly emblazoned on it. Careless special effects.)#
KIRK:  We'll enter as soon as the doors open. Go on my command. (The doors open, and a man falls to the floor. He is white on the right side, and black on the left. This is important.)#
KIRK: Do we have any knowledge of a planet that could have produced such a race of beings?#
KIRK: Bones, what do you make of it?#
KIRK: And judging by looking at him, we know at the very least he is the result of a very dramatic conflict. Spock?#
KIRK: Your prognosis, Doctor?#
KIRK: You're aboard the starship Enterprise.#
KIRK: Federation. So was the shuttlecraft that you were flying in.#
KIRK: Don't you usually know whose property you've stolen?#
KIRK: Well, certainly no ordinary thief, considering what it is you appropriated.#
KIRK: Well, I do know you made off with a ship that didn't belong to you.#
KIRK: You can try those technical evasions on Starfleet Command. That's where you'll be facing your charges.#
KIRK: Don't mention it. We're pleased to have caught you. Who are you?#
KIRK: Go on.#
KIRK: That's in the southernmost part of the galaxy, in an uncharted quarter. What are you doing so far from home?  You understand that when we complete our mission, we'll take you to Starbase where you'll face a very serious charge.#
KIRK: Had what? What were you going to do?#
KIRK: We've never encountered a being like you. I'd like to know more about you and your planet.#
KIRK: And very evasive. Or at least not fully responsive. Now, then,#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura.#
KIRK: Notify Starbase Four that we've recovered its shuttlecraft, and it will be returned along with its user as soon as we've completed our mission at Ariannus.#
KIRK: Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is applicable, I'll make a note of it in my report.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: I'll be right there. Notify Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Put the ship on the viewing screen, Mister Sulu. Magnification. Still nothing, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Maximum magnification. I draw a blank, Mister Spock. Your response?#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device?#
KIRK: Weaponry on the vessel, Spock?#
KIRK: Something out there can't be seen. Explanation?#
KIRK: Invisible. Malfunction?#
KIRK: Evasive action.#
KIRK: Deflector shields activated, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Sound warning for collision. Red Alert.#
KIRK: Read out, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: What is it now?#
KIRK: Where?#
KIRK: Explain, Spock. One of a kind?#
KIRK: Of the planet Cheron, no doubt.#
KIRK: Your mode of travel was also unorthodox. Secure from Red Alert. What happened to your vehicle?#
KIRK: What brings you to us?#
KIRK: All personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command. No one claims anyone without due process.#
KIRK: What is your authorisation? From what source?#
KIRK: He's in Sickbay. Remember, since you're aboard the Enterprise, you're bound by its regulations.#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: I told you where you were going. I allowed your fellow countryman here simply as a courtesy.#
KIRK: It's now very clear you know each other extremely well, gentlemen. The only service this ship can offer is to bring you together. It is not a battlefield.#
KIRK: I'll tell you once more. For you, this ship is a prison.#
KIRK: Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation. No treaties have ever been signed. Your demand for possession of this prisoner cannot be honoured. There are no extradition procedures to allow it. Is that clear, Commissioner Bele?#
KIRK: How do you mean?#
KIRK: I cannot take sides.#
KIRK: Impossible. I have a mission to accomplish. There's a planet to be decontaminated. Millions of lives are at stake. Once that has been completed, I'll return to Starbase Four and turn you both over to the authorities. You can make your case to them.#
KIRK: Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer you every hospitality aboard this ship. Choose any other course,#
KIRK: Yes, I am. I think we can consider your problem settled. At least for the present. I have ordered guest quarters for you on deck six.#
KIRK: And I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal chords. It seems you'll have a double opportunity to practise your oratory on Starbase Four.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Well, get back on course.#
KIRK: I'll be right there.#
KIRK: Have you located the malfunction?#
KIRK: Explanation, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Kirk to engineering.#
KIRK: Scotty, we're suddenly off course. Check our manoeuvering controls.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Stand by for check. Scotty, we're still off course.#
KIRK: Speed, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: And new course?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, put the ship on Red Alert. All hands, this is the captain. The ship is on Red Alert.#
KIRK: Our new heading, Mister Chekov?#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: You're two of a kind.#
KIRK: Security, put them both in the brig.#
KIRK: Phasers on stun. Fire.#
KIRK: This ship is going to Ariannus.#
KIRK: We are going to Ariannus. The lives of a billion people make no other choice possible.#
KIRK: Bele, I am captain of this ship, and it will follow whatever course I set for it, or I will order its destruction.#
KIRK: I will destroy it.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the bridge to the master computer.#
KIRK: Computer, destruct sequence. Are you ready to copy?#
KIRK: Prepare to verify destruct sequence code one. Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Destruct sequence one, code one, one A. COMPUTER Voice and code one, one A verified and correct. Sequence one complete. KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by my orders?#
KIRK: Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Begin thirty second countdown. Code zero, zero, zero, destruct zero.#
KIRK: Let's see you prevent the computer from fulfilling my commands.#
KIRK: From five to zero, no command in the universe can prevent the computer from fulfilling its destruct orders.#
KIRK: You can use your will to drag this ship to Cheron. But I command the computer. Mine is the final command.#
KIRK: Computer. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Code one, two, three continuity. Abort destruct order. Repeat code one, two, three continuity. Abort destruct order.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus?#
KIRK: We're waiting for you to fulfil your commitment, Commissioner.#
KIRK: I make no deals for control of this ship, sir.#
KIRK: Ship's course?#
KIRK: Speed, Scotty?#
KIRK: Good. Lieutenant Uhura, cancel Red Alert.#
KIRK: Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen. I could put you in the brig for what you have done, but I won't do it because you are new to this part of the galaxy, which is governed by the United Federation of Planets. We live in peace with full exercise of individual rights. The need to resort to violence and force has long since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship. You are free to move about the ship. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my crew. But let me make it clear. I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship. All hands, return to normal routine. Captain out.#
KIRK: We try, sir.#
KIRK: That's enough for today. Those two are beginning to affect you.#
KIRK: I expect the answer is already on its way.#
KIRK: Let's do that.#
KIRK: No, Commissioner. The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft.#
KIRK: Excuse me.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Yes, read it.#
KIRK: That's enough. Thank you.#
KIRK: Now, wait a minute, Commissioner,#
KIRK: I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be twisted, not by Lokai, nor by you.#
KIRK: You're black on one side and white on the other.#
KIRK: I fail to see the significant difference.#
KIRK: Let Lokai state his grievances. Hear him, listen to him. Maybe he can change. Maybe he wants to change his image.#
KIRK: There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was true.#
KIRK: Excuse me. Kirk here.#
KIRK: Very good. Commence decontamination procedures when ready. Advise when complete.#
KIRK: Good. Repeat procedure for maximum effect.#
KIRK: Very good. We'll be right up.#
KIRK: Set directional controls for Starbase Four. Kirk out. Will you join us on the bridge?#
KIRK: Can you determine which ones?#
KIRK: At the moment, I seem to have no choice.#
KIRK: After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much alive.#
KIRK: Bele, you keep this up, and you'll never get to Cheron with your prisoner. The rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged. This will be your final battlefield. Your fifty thousand years of pursuit will have been wasted.#
KIRK: And you, Lokai, will die here in space. You'll inspire no more disciples. Your cause will be ended.#
KIRK: You've made your point.#
KIRK: I understand. Will you return the Enterprise to my control?#
KIRK: Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed?#
KIRK: Check controls and co-ordinates.#
KIRK: Is it within visual range?#
KIRK: Chekov, put it on the screen. Extreme magnification. What are you picking up?#
KIRK: You mean, all the people are dead?#
KIRK: Yes, Commissioner, all of them.#
KIRK: Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock? Your planet is dead! There's nobody alive on Cheron because of hate. The cause you fought about no longer exists. Give yourselves time to breathe. Give up your hate. You're welcome to live with us. Listen to me. You both must end up dead if you don't stop hating.#
KIRK: Bele. The chase is finished.#
KIRK: Bele.#
KIRK: No, Lieutenant. Where can they run? (Through the ship, knocking over crewmen, whilst imagining the buildings burning on their home planet.)#
KIRK: Spock, anyone in the transporter room?#
KIRK: There's nobody there to try him. His judges are all dead.#
KIRK: Of course.#
KIRK: No, but that's all they have left. Warp factor two, Mister Sulu. Set course for Starbase Four.#
KIRK: Donald, good to see you.#
KIRK: We'd be delighted.#
KIRK: Why, Donald, are you becoming a pessimist?#
KIRK: When I was a cadet at the Academy, his exploits were required reading. He was one of my heroes. I'd like to see him.#
KIRK: What is it you want to tell me?#
KIRK: You're afraid to talk in front of Governor Cory?#
KIRK: Cory?#
KIRK: Garth, do you have to make him suffer like that?#
KIRK: I'm sorry. I should've said Captain Garth.#
KIRK: I'm sorry, Lord Garth.#
KIRK: Release him.#
KIRK: Are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned?#
KIRK: Thank you. Now what have you done with the medicine?#
KIRK: Destroyed it? It was your only hope.#
KIRK: Of course.#
KIRK: The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny.#
KIRK: Governor Cory, how do you feel?#
KIRK: How does he manage to change form at will?#
KIRK: He was such a genius. What a waste.#
KIRK: Force field is on. Good. Remain here out of sight until I give the order to join me. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK:  No! No! No! (ends up thumping the floor until he changes beck to Garth.#
KIRK: Thank you for your concern. All in all, it's been rather restful.#
KIRK: I'd forgotten.#
KIRK: Where is Mister Spock?#
KIRK: How are you, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Isn't Governor Cory joining us?#
KIRK: An oversight?#
KIRK: In that case, we must decline with thanks.#
KIRK: You're very persuasive.#
KIRK: Not really.#
KIRK: All we need is a few seconds, if Scotty has alerted the security detail.#
KIRK: Yes, er, incredible.#
KIRK: Oh, er, thank you. That's, er, very magnanimous of you.#
KIRK: That's very flattering. I am primarily an explorer now, Captain Garth.#
KIRK: And tried to destroy Antos Four. SPOCK: Why?#
KIRK: Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue.#
KIRK: I agree there was a time when war was necessary, and you were our greatest warrior. I studied your victory at Axanar when I was a cadet. In fact it's still required reading at the Academy.#
KIRK: Very well. But my first visit to Axanar was as a new fledged cadet on a peace mission.#
KIRK: They were humanitarians and statesmen, and they had a dream. A dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars, a dream that made Mister Spock and me brothers.#
KIRK: No thank you. I prefer to join Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Occasionally.#
KIRK: I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves.#
KIRK: I can't for the life of me imagine which one.#
KIRK: Dead I am of no use to you.#
KIRK: Yes, I think it's very good.#
KIRK: I can't.#
KIRK: Yes, I recognise it. It's used for rehabilitation purposes.#
KIRK: Stop it!#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta?#
KIRK: I believe you mean that.#
KIRK: Marta. Marta, I can help you, but I must get to the Enterprise to do that.#
KIRK: Yes, it is. It is if I can get to the control room and remove the force field, then Garth is finished.#
KIRK: He will lead you to destruction. He's already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you. But there's more medicine aboard the ship.#
KIRK: Spock?#
KIRK: How did you manage that?#
KIRK: I'm very glad to see you.#
KIRK: Yes, you presume correctly. (They head along the corridor, until they see a Tellarite standing guard. Spock stuns him. Kirk takes his weapon and they head into the control room.)#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down here on the double.#
KIRK: And have Doctor McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible.#
KIRK: Very well, Spock.#
KIRK: Scotty, Mister Spock will give the countersign.#
KIRK: What have you done with Spock? Where is he?#
KIRK: Captain Garth#
KIRK: No, sir. Captain Garth, Starship fleet Captain. That's an honourable title.#
KIRK: Yes, you were. Yes. But you're a sick man now, sir.#
KIRK: No. No, think. Think back to what you were before the accident that sent you to Antos Four. Try.#
KIRK: No, I, I can remember. You were the finest student at the Academy, the finest Starship Captain. You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us.#
KIRK: And you bore it well. And the disease that changed you, it's not your fault. And the terrible things you did since then, not truly responsible.#
KIRK: No, I'm not. I want you to find what you once had. I want you to go back to the greatness that you've lost, Captain Garth.#
KIRK: No, sir, listen to me. I#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: Coronation?#
KIRK: Yes, I agree. You'll wear a crown too, I presume?#
KIRK: Garth, you have only a handful of men.#
KIRK: No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all. Besides, you seem to need me alive.#
KIRK: Listen to me. This may be our last chance. Garth will destroy all of us unless you help me stop him. And he's using you, you know that, because he wants the power for himself. I brought something that might have cured you, but he destroyed it. If I can get a patrol down, they'd bring more of that medicine and (Kirk tries to switch off the forcefield and gets hits for his effort. Garth enters.)#
KIRK: All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you.#
KIRK:  I'm your Captain, Spock! Can't you tell? Shoot! Shoot! KIRK:  He's right, Spock. You must shoot, but shoot both of us. It's the only way to ensure the safety of the Enterprise. (Spock shoots the aggressive Kirk with the chair, who then turns back into Garth. Spock switches off the force field.)#
KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Captain Garth, I'm James Kirk.#
KIRK: The starship Enterprise.#
KIRK: Yes, sir, the Enterprise. I'm the captain. (Kirk and Garth shake hands) Can I help?#
KIRK: No, Captain. No. KIRK: Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Tell me something. Why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us?#
KIRK: Yes, and congratulations. What took you so long?#
KIRK: I see. Mister Spock. Letting yourself be hit on the head, and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head, is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved. Mister Scott, ready to beam up.#
KIRK: You won't have long to wait.#
KIRK: Let's go, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Mister Spock?  Mister Spock. I have not yet transported down. Why did you leave your post before confirming transport? Mister Spock? Spock?#
KIRK: Engineering?#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, report immediately. All bridge personnel, report immediately.#
KIRK: Sickbay? Doctor McCoy?#
KIRK: Bones? Bones, answer me.#
KIRK: Bones. Still orbiting Gideon.#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: What are you doing on my ship?#
KIRK: Not my personal property, but I'm the captain.#
KIRK: It seems, at the moment, we have it all to ourselves.#
KIRK: Kirk. I'm sorry. James Kirk. And I didn't bring you here.#
KIRK: That's right. Who has brought you here?#
KIRK: You? What happened before you came here? Try to remember. It's important.#
KIRK: Don't be afraid.#
KIRK: I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the Enterprise. Four hundred and thirty, and I, apparently, am the only one left.#
KIRK: Maybe you can. Tell me the rest. You were fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out of there.#
KIRK: How long have you been aboard the Enterprise?#
KIRK: It might be. Come with me.#
KIRK: Nine minutes of my life has been lost.#
KIRK: Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon and the time I found myself here alone, nine minutes have disappeared just like that. Now what happened during those minutes?#
KIRK: That's your home. The planet that you come from.#
KIRK: It must be.#
KIRK: That's impossible. We were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of Gideon. I tried to beam down, something happened, and you were beamed aboard from Gideon.#
KIRK: We're no longer over Gideon.#
KIRK: I don't know. I'm not familiar with that quadrant. Odona, you must realise that we're not here by accident. Some force, some intelligence has arranged this for a purpose.#
KIRK: Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Captain Kirk here. Red priority. Red priority.#
KIRK: It seems to be.#
KIRK: Captain Kirk here. Please answer red priority. Please answer red priority. Well, if someone is listening, they're not answering.#
KIRK: They wouldn't. (Kirk goes to the engineering station and swaps a couple of tapes over.)#
KIRK: Took the ship out of warp speed.#
KIRK: Space terminology. We're no longer moving faster than the speed of light. I've trimmed down to sublight speed until we find out where we are.#
KIRK: Of course it does. Maybe it is the same.#
KIRK:  If you believe that, we have.#
KIRK: It isn't really, you know.#
KIRK: Yes. Yes, it is. Very, very beautiful.#
KIRK: How long would you like it to last?#
KIRK: Well, let's see. Power, that's no problem, it regenerates. And food. We have enough to feed a crew of four hundred and thirty for five years. So that should last us#
KIRK: Most people are afraid of being alone.#
KIRK: Why? Why are the people of Gideon like that?#
KIRK: It might be Gideon.#
KIRK: Yes. It might help me pinpoint our location.#
KIRK: I've got to contact whoever is manipulating us. There must be a way. Odona. Odona, can you remember why your people dream of being alone?#
KIRK: Why? What makes it so impossible to be alone?#
KIRK: Who sent you here?#
KIRK: You've come to kill. Odona, have you come to die?#
KIRK: Now, all I have to do is find a medical kit, and I can completely cure this.#
KIRK: Yes, the irritation would be gone.#
KIRK: No. Over something as simple as this? No, it'll cure itself eventually, but. Do you know, uh I don't even remember how this happened. Do you hear that?#
KIRK: No, the ship's engines don't make that kind of sound.#
KIRK: I know every sound that this ship might make. That's coming from outside.#
KIRK: A storm might, but you wouldn't be able to hear it. Come on.#
KIRK: This is a viewing port. We'll be able to see outside. If there's a storm, we'll be able to see it.#
KIRK: If it works. (uses a manual override, and the shutters slide open to reveal faces which are then replaced by a starfield.)#
KIRK: It was like the heartbeat of all those people, and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship.#
KIRK: Yes, I said that.#
KIRK: Yes, they can.#
KIRK: It could be a mirage. They could exist in our minds.#
KIRK: Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet. But why?#
KIRK: I think I have an idea. So that we won't keep trying to find out where we are, that we'll be content to stay here.#
KIRK: Be content? Be content? Not until I find out what happened to my crew. Are they dead?#
KIRK: Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself?#
KIRK: Hodin.#
KIRK: Let me in there. I can help her.#
KIRK: But she's ill.#
KIRK: Let me see her.#
KIRK: You don't know what she may have.#
KIRK: It's very rare, and always fatal if not treated within twenty four hours. I know, it almost killed me.#
KIRK: That's how my arm got hurt.#
KIRK: You're mad.#
KIRK: Your report to the Federation was a tissue of lies. You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions that would make Gideon a paradise.#
KIRK: Those are conditions most people would envy.#
KIRK: Then why haven't you introduced any of the new techniques to sterilise men and women?#
KIRK: Then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent conception. The Federation will provide anything you need.#
KIRK: And the great misery which you now face.#
KIRK: Yet you can kill a young girl.#
KIRK: You're killing your own daughter. How can you do that?#
KIRK: The virus you need is very rare. Who will provide it?#
KIRK: No sir, not me. You have many methods available. I've mentioned only a few. I do not offer my life for this purpose. I have many plans, and I have hopes other than death for Odona.#
KIRK: What was said and what happened between us was for us alone.#
KIRK: So that was your plan. That I would fall so under her spell that I would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice.#
KIRK: If you don't allow me to bring Doctor McCoy down here, it'll soon be too late to do anything for her.#
KIRK: Her death is unnecessary. Even if she lives, her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would.#
KIRK: Very short.#
KIRK: And it can continue. If only you'll allow me, I can cure you.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, we have a patient for Doctor McCoy. Have Scotty beam us up.#
KIRK: Why, because you're well again?#
KIRK: At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you.#
KIRK: Thank you, ma'am.#
KIRK: Is that what you want to do?#
KIRK: You're needed everywhere, Odona.#
KIRK: Oh, yes, it is. It's exactly the same. Only this one works.#
KIRK: Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy. With another difference. This one is crowded.#
KIRK: It does now.#
KIRK: Yes, Odona, I have to.#
KIRK:  Kirk to transporter control. One to beam down to the planet Gideon.#
KIRK: Mister Scott. Mister Scott?#
KIRK: As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha, you and Lieutenant Romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor. You�ll prepare for direct transfer of equipment.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the Federation? KIRK: Yes. Good luck, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Is that Memory Alpha?#
KIRK: Magnification eight. What is that?#
KIRK: Readings?#
KIRK: Check that. No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light.#
KIRK: Deflectors on. Condition yellow.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, get us the devil out of here! Full scan on the disturbance that penetrated the Bridge. Lieutenant, all decks, damage report.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. Emergency. Emergency.#
KIRK: I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty?#
KIRK: Get to Sickbay, Lieutenant. That's an order.#
KIRK: No, Mister Scott. Stay at your post for the moment.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura. Damage report.#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Any damage to the warp engines?#
KIRK: Good. From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we can get.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, explanation.#
KIRK: Or attack.#
KIRK: And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.#
KIRK: Main screen projection.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that phenomena. Give me an ETA for its possible impact.#
KIRK: No shields?#
KIRK: Wonderful. I hope the storm is aware of that rationale.#
KIRK: Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov?#
KIRK: Lieutenant, try and warn them of#
KIRK: Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha?#
KIRK: Lock into orbit.#
KIRK: Any life readings?#
KIRK: Let's find out what's going on down there. Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott, report. Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott. Where the devil is he? Scotty, report to the Bridge. Report to the Bridge. Have the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down.#
KIRK: Scotty, where've you been? Where are you?#
KIRK: Are you sick?#
KIRK: Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis, Mister Scott. Is the doctor there with you, or will I find him in Engineering?#
KIRK: Scotty, can you get us some more light?#
KIRK: Damage report, Spock.#
KIRK: Locate him and keep him alive. We need more information about this enemy.#
KIRK: Bones, can you do something?#
KIRK: Are you sure?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately.#
KIRK: Spock, have you seen anything like that before?#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: What did she die of?#
KIRK: What did the others die of?#
KIRK: A different centre of the brain, you say?#
KIRK: Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking.#
KIRK: I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me.#
KIRK: They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician.#
KIRK: Lieutenant. Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Why? Tell me why.#
KIRK: How do you know?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: What's its course?#
KIRK: Beam us up.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, this is the captain. Get the Enterprise out of here.#
KIRK: Delay that order, Mister Sulu!#
KIRK: All right, Mister Sulu, get us out of here. Mister Scott, check emergency manual monitor for transporter control.#
KIRK: Plot the new course, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Plot it. Present course will bring it across our starboard side, sir. KIRK: Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm. Explain.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted.#
KIRK: Activate shields.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, change course to one four three mark three.#
KIRK: Storm's course, Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Take evasive action.#
KIRK: Hard starboard, two one seven mark five.#
KIRK: Hard port, one one seven mark two.#
KIRK: Is it closing?#
KIRK: Your analysis, Spock. What is it?#
KIRK: Who are they? Where are they from?#
KIRK: It's clear we can't outrun them. Can we shield against them?#
KIRK: There must be some defence we can use.#
KIRK: Maybe we can avoid another attack. Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels. Tie in the universal translator. Mister Spock says it's alive. Maybe I can talk to it.#
KIRK: This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We wish you no harm. Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms. Please, do not come any closer to our ship.#
KIRK: Perhaps it understands another kind of language. Condition Red Alert. Prepare for phaser firing.#
KIRK: Lock in phaser tracking controls. Locked in, sir. KIRK: Adjust phasers to fire across its course. Do not hit it.#
KIRK: Fire. Reaction, Mister Sulu?#
KIRK: Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing. Prepare to lock phasers into the heart of the community.#
KIRK: Fire.#
KIRK: Lock in for another blast.#
KIRK: Killing Lieutenant Romaine?#
KIRK: Get her to Sickbay at once.#
KIRK: Cancel that order. Another attack on that alien life form will kill Lieutenant Romaine.#
KIRK: If she is to survive, we can't attack.#
KIRK: Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been accumulating?#
KIRK: And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects. Captain Kirk to Doctor McCoy.#
KIRK: Is the girl well enough to be questioned?#
KIRK: Have the Lieutenant and Mister Scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible. Bring all available biographical material with you. Kirk out. Mister Spock, come with me.#
KIRK: I'll try.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Romaine.#
KIRK: We must get to understand what is happening.#
KIRK: Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new crewman. Don't let us upset you.#
KIRK: This investigation has been prompted by two events. First is the time you passed out on the Bridge, and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured you.#
KIRK: Now this is how we'll proceed. Mister Spock has all the information available to us about our attackers. Doctor McCoy has access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you. A comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and ourselves. All right, gentlemen? Doctor McCoy, will you proceed?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the attackers?#
KIRK: Thank you. Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends?#
KIRK: Continue evasive manoeuvres. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Doctor, do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available?#
KIRK: I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked. Any history of psychosomatic illness?#
KIRK: Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities?#
KIRK: Any pathological or unusual empathic responses?#
KIRK: Go ahead, Doctor.#
KIRK: Go ahead.#
KIRK: That's impossible!#
KIRK: Let's see it.#
KIRK: Check it, Spock. (Spock puts his computer disc in, and the two patterns overlap and match exactly.)#
KIRK: Continue evasive action. Keep me informed. Kirk out.#
KIRK: Why didn't you report it?#
KIRK: What did she see?#
KIRK: Those were all acts carried out by our attacker.#
KIRK: Yes, Scotty? What else?#
KIRK: Was he wrong, Lieutenant?#
KIRK: What did you see?#
KIRK: Where?#
KIRK: What was he doing?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: What success did you have?#
KIRK: Warp eight, Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha. You are especially susceptible to their will. But we have one chance to survive. Don't resist. Let them begin to function through you. If we can control that moment, we have a chance. Will you try?#
KIRK: Captain Kirk to medical lab.#
KIRK: Prepare the antigrav test units. Let's go.#
KIRK: As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports.#
KIRK: Stay where you are.#
KIRK: Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on.#
KIRK: That's not Mira talking.#
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. Do you understand?#
KIRK: Who are you?#
KIRK: You can't be from Zetar. All life was destroyed there long ago.#
KIRK: Then what are you?#
KIRK: All things die.#
KIRK: The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead.#
KIRK: She will not. She is fighting for her own identity.#
KIRK: Will she learn the way people on Memory Alpha learned?#
KIRK: But you did kill!#
KIRK: The price of your survival is too high.#
KIRK: You can't have her. You're entitled to your own life, but not another's.#
KIRK: They'll be forced to accept it.#
KIRK: We must get her into the pressure chamber.#
KIRK: Secure the chamber. Neutralise gravity.#
KIRK: Pressurise the unit. Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second. Continue increasing pressure. Pressure, Spock. Pressure.#
KIRK: Continue, Spock.#
KIRK: Pressure!#
KIRK: Bones, are you able to judge the long range effects on Lieutenant Romaine?#
KIRK: Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor?#
KIRK: Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not return to Starbase for further treatment?#
KIRK: Captain Kirk to Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine?#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Scott. Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?#
KIRK: Thank you. Kirk to Bridge.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha. Lieutenant Romaine has a lot of work to do there.#
KIRK: Well, this is an Enterprise first. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement. Can I stand the strain?#
KIRK:  At Federation orders, we're proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana, where the only source of zenite exists. It is the one substance that can halt the plague.#
KIRK: On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: There must be some mistake. Do you have the co-ordinates to the mine entrance available?#
KIRK: Kirk to transporter room.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city, Stratos?#
KIRK: Fine. Uhura. Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, and that we're beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite. The need is urgent.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, come with me. Oh, and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future.#
KIRK: Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it.#
KIRK: Once. I didn't have time to look around.#
KIRK: Yes, art is the population's chief occupation.#
KIRK: There's the mine entrance. The zenite consignment should have been there. I don't understand it. Those Troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down.#
KIRK: Perhaps.#
KIRK: Who are you? What's the meaning of this attack?#
KIRK: We're here by permission of your government council on an emergency mission.#
KIRK: No, just a little shaken up.#
KIRK: Captain Kirk, Enterprise. My first officer, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: It was rather warm.#
KIRK: Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment. Why wasn't it in its specified location?#
KIRK: They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it.#
KIRK: Hostages? For what purpose?#
KIRK: Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor.#
KIRK: Pleasure, madam.#
KIRK: What are their demands?#
KIRK: I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak Two.#
KIRK: I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the Federation.#
KIRK: You again!#
KIRK: Yes, duty is a good teacher. I see you've changed your dressmaker.#
KIRK: So you can attack me again? That would be foolish.#
KIRK: I'm not afraid. In fact, I find this rather enjoyable.#
KIRK: All right, I'll make a deal with you. You answer some questions and I'll let you up.#
KIRK: Your word first.#
KIRK: Then why this?#
KIRK: No, not at all. In fact her visit was quite enlightening.#
KIRK: Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the Enterprise is here to intimidate them.#
KIRK: We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it.#
KIRK: In times of emergency, they do anything. And believe me, this botanical plague is an emergency.#
KIRK: Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all humanoids. Surely, you don't deny it to the Troglytes.#
KIRK: They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment.#
KIRK: Yes, I should have realised.#
KIRK: Mister Advisor!#
KIRK: You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her.#
KIRK: Surely there are better methods than this.#
KIRK: Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured!#
KIRK: The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to Vanna.#
KIRK: But obviously no more consideration.#
KIRK: The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us.#
KIRK: Of course, but Starfleet command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel, Mister Advisor.#
KIRK: Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite.#
KIRK: You won't get it through torture.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, we're ready to beam up.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command that the zenite has not been delivered. In my opinion, Plasus' method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed. If the zenite is not delivered shortly, I shall have to violate Plasus' order of non-interference and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the use of reason.#
KIRK: That's impossible, Bones. The Troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause. Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of that.#
KIRK: Natural growths? What kind?#
KIRK: And the mines are full of that gas.#
KIRK: Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna. It seems impossible. They've outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months.#
KIRK: Does the brain return to normal?#
KIRK: Can you neutralise the gas?#
KIRK: Find one. Meet us in the transporter room.#
KIRK: This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life, chemical as well as bacterial. We have used these filter masks frequently on#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly. We've checked his findings through the computer and they're absolutely valid.#
KIRK: There's no time to argue about the findings now. I simply propose to tell Vanna all about them.#
KIRK: This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes. I would like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenite consignment.#
KIRK: Are you afraid the filter masks will work? Is that why you don't want the Troglytes to try them?#
KIRK: I am here to get that zenite. If these will help me get them, I'll use them.#
KIRK: My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate.#
KIRK: Doesn't give us much choice, does it.#
KIRK: Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters.#
KIRK: If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. This is the only thing that might convince her.#
KIRK: If you�re about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer is negative, Spock. That goes for you too, Bones.#
KIRK: Officially, yes. But this mission is strictly unofficial. Nobody's to have any part in it, any responsibility for it, but myself. That's an order, Spock. You have the conn. Stand by till I contact you.#
KIRK: Vanna, I've brought you a gift. There's a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of the Troglytes exposed to it for a period of time. This mask will prevent any further damage.#
KIRK: Yes.#
KIRK: That's true. But an idea can't be seen or felt. That's what's kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries, a mistaken idea.#
KIRK: Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.#
KIRK: Plasus is not the whole government.#
KIRK: As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back. I'll request permission to mediate for the Troglytes. Vanna, you must trust me. I give you my word.#
KIRK: The zenite can be delivered in a few hours. You won't have long to wait now.#
KIRK: Vanna, you must trust me. If you don't, millions of people will die. A whole planet. This zenite is all that can save them. This filter mask is all that can save the Troglytes. Trust me. Please.#
KIRK:  We had a bargain. Why did you break it?#
KIRK: I trusted you.#
KIRK: Then you are a fool. These masks will free you, just as I said.#
KIRK: Holding me won't help you. My men'll still come for that zenite consignment.#
KIRK: They'll still come.#
KIRK: Without that mask, I haven't#
KIRK: It takes a while for its effects to be noticed.#
KIRK: Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill everyone?#
KIRK: The masks can change that.#
KIRK: How long do you plan on keeping me here, providing Midro doesn't kill me, of course?#
KIRK: That's quite a while. Longer than I expected. (Kirk jumps Vanna, gets the phaser and uses it to cause a rockfall in the tunnel)#
KIRK: Completely.#
KIRK: Die from something that can't be seen? You astound me, Vanna. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Nothing. Are you locked in on me?#
KIRK: Circumstances dictate a slight variation, Spock.#
KIRK: Hold on these co-ordinates. Locate the High Advisor and beam him to these co-ordinates immediately. Without advance communication. Repeat, without advance communication. Have you got that, Spock?#
KIRK: I am preparing a demonstration on the effects of unbelieved gas.#
KIRK: Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas, Mister Advisor.#
KIRK: Perhaps you need closer exposure. Fill that container.#
KIRK: I insist.#
KIRK: You too, Vanna. You too! Dig! Kirk here. What is it?#
KIRK: Your orders are to stand by. Now, carry them out! Kirk out.#
KIRK: We'll leave when the gas has effect.#
KIRK: Dig!#
KIRK: I said dig!#
KIRK: One more step and I'll kill you.#
KIRK: Both will kill. (Kirk throws his phaser away, and Plasus attacks him with two mortae. Kirk quickly disarms him, and they wrestle instead. Vanna notices the communicator has fallen off Kirk's belt, and picks it up)#
KIRK: The zenite gas.#
KIRK: Well, it seems my little demonstration was quite a success.#
KIRK: They will be very effective. sir. They've been severely tested, and the Troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties.#
KIRK: Thank you, Vanna.#
KIRK: Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties. The Federation Bureau of Industrialisation may be of aid to you.#
KIRK: Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return here. Only answering your charges against me will force me back.#
KIRK: You're guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting against his life.#
KIRK: Yes, Vanna. They never happened. Mister Advisor? Mister Spock, let's get that zenite delivered. I believe we only have three hours left.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott beam us up.#
KIRK: Hailing frequencies. Aurora, this is the USS Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk commanding. Acknowledge. Aurora, this is the Enterprise. Do you read me?#
KIRK: Repeat. Federation orders to detain you for#
KIRK: Change course. Pursue and overtake.#
KIRK: Stand by tractor beams.#
KIRK: Engage.#
KIRK: Bring them in.#
KIRK: Aurora, cut power. You are overtaxing your ship.#
KIRK: Emergency power to tractor beams. Bridge to Transporter room. Scotty, are you ready to transport?#
KIRK: Are we within transportation range?#
KIRK: Aurora personnel, stand by to be transported aboard. Energise.#
KIRK: Are they aboard? Scotty, are they aboard?#
KIRK: Scotty, take them to the briefing room.#
KIRK: What's going on?#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: No, I'll be right down. Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Which one of you is Tongo Rad?#
KIRK: You can thank your father's influence for the fact you're not under arrest. In addition to piracy, you've left yourself open to charges of violating flight regulations, entering hostile space and endangering the lives of others as well as your own.#
KIRK: In addition you've caused an interstellar incident which may have destroyed everything that's been negotiated between your planet and the Federation.#
KIRK: If you have an explanation, I am prepared to hear it.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, take them to Sickbay for a medical check. There may have been radiation from the explosion.#
KIRK: By all means.#
KIRK: That planet it is a myth.#
KIRK: Well, whether you recognise authority or not, I am it on this ship. I am under orders to transport you back to Starbase peaceably. From there you'll be ferried to your various planets. Because of my orders, you are not prisoners, but my guests. I expect you to behave as such.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, you seem to understand these people. You will deal with them.#
KIRK: And after they are finished in Sickbay, see to it that they're escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they need.#
KIRK: I have orders to the contrary. This is not a passenger ship.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Palmer, notify Starbase we have the six aboard who stole the space cruiser Aurora. Regrettably, the space cruiser itself was destroyed.#
KIRK: Personal note to the Catullan ambassador. His son is safe.#
KIRK: Yes, what is it?#
KIRK: One of those was in the Academy?#
KIRK: Do you wish to see her? Permission to leave your post.#
KIRK: Are they in the Sickbay?#
KIRK: Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists?#
KIRK: Doctor Sevrin is their leader?#
KIRK: Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides. And they seek the primitive.#
KIRK: All do. The cave is deep in our memory.#
KIRK: But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible#
KIRK: Spock. What does Herbert mean?#
KIRK: Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking.#
KIRK: What's going on, Bones?#
KIRK: Does he have it? What about the others?#
KIRK: Is the crew in danger?#
KIRK: Put him in isolation.#
KIRK: Yes, I'm ready. Kirk to Security. I want a guard maintained on Doctor Sevrin until further notice. Bones, how long before we know whether the crew has been endangered by this infection?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu, explain.#
KIRK: Doctor Sevrin will be released when we think he is medically safe.#
KIRK: Yes, Scotty, what is it?#
KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. Mister Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people. Do you think you can persuade them to behave?#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. If it weren't for that ambassador's son, they'd all be in the brig.#
KIRK: I'll have Bones check him out. Spock, I'm sorry. You had great respect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done.#
KIRK: Certainly. Mister Chekov, assist Mister Spock. Bridge to Sickbay.#
KIRK: Bones.#
KIRK: I'd like to talk to you. Captain's log, stardate 5832.6. I have asked Doctor McCoy to check Starfleet medical records to verify Mister Spock's suspicion that Doctor Sevrin is insane. In spite of Doctor Sevrin's antipathy to us, he has promised Mister Spock that he will order his disciples to conform to our rules and regulations.#
KIRK: I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty. Didn't you? (Rad takes out the man on duty in Auxiliary control, then he and Sevrin sit down and start changing things)#
KIRK: Bridge to auxiliary control. Bridge to auxiliary control.#
KIRK: Can he do it?#
KIRK: Start a trace-back of all circuits.#
KIRK: Any patrols?#
KIRK: There will be soon. Doctor Sevrin. You are violating Romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy.#
KIRK: And return to Starbase, no charges will be leveled.#
KIRK: If you do not, you will never reach Eden. You and this ship will be destroyed.#
KIRK: Adam.#
KIRK: You are being led by a man who is insane.#
KIRK: Spock, you tell them.#
KIRK: Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now. We have no choice. Mister Spock, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Spock! It's all right, Spock. It stopped.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Kirk to Engineering. Bridge? Hangar deck? Kirk to Transporter Room. Kirk to Bridge. Do you read me? Come in.#
KIRK: Never mind. Do we have control of the ship?#
KIRK: Can we break out of orbit if we have to?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: Stand by. Do you read any Romulans?#
KIRK: Where?#
KIRK: Auxiliary control to Doctor McCoy. Bones, are you all right?#
KIRK: Stand by, transporter room. Full medical gear.#
KIRK: No. No, they tried to destroy us. Let them think they succeeded. I want the co-ordinates zeroed in so that when we beam down, we won't be visible to them. Scotty, you have the conn. If any Romulans appear, try to make them understand. I do not want to provoke combat. Mister Spock. Mister Chekov, join us in the transporter room.#
KIRK: Is this what they believed they'd find? Then I can understand. Spread out. Approach with caution.  Doctor Sevrin.#
KIRK: What is it?#
KIRK: Will our clothing protect us?#
KIRK: Bones?#
KIRK: There's the shuttlecraft.#
KIRK: Here, we'll help you.#
KIRK: Doctor Sevrin. Bones!#
KIRK: We can help you aboard the ship.#
KIRK: Be sensible, Doctor.#
KIRK: Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself!#
KIRK: Stop!#
KIRK: Alert them that we have the four and we're ready to beam them down. And mark the incident closed.#
KIRK: Bridge to Transporter. Scotty, are they there?#
KIRK: Stand by. Mister Chekov, do you wish to attend?#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Chekov. You did what you had to do. As did we all. Even your friends. You may go.#
KIRK: We reach, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: Report.#
KIRK: Let's get that ryetalyn. (A strange device comes travelling through the air towards them. A bit like Nomad, but much smaller and with more round bits. It fires an energy beam at the landing party's feet. They try to fire their phasers.) KIRK: Inoperative.#
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk#
KIRK: Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mister?#
KIRK: Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there. We can't possibly reach another planet in time. You can't refuse us the ryetalyn.#
KIRK: We're in need! We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it.#
KIRK: But you have the ryetalyn that we need! If necessary, we'll take it.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our co-ordinates.#
KIRK: Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn.#
KIRK: We need only a few hours.#
KIRK: With all due gratitude.#
KIRK: A most impressive home, Mister Flint.#
KIRK: If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting, right over Mister Flint if necessary.#
KIRK: Please.#
KIRK: Would be? You mean you think they're fakes?#
KIRK: Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover, a setup, or even an illusion.#
KIRK: Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder reading of our host. See if he's human. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott?#
KIRK: Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on this planet, Holberg Nine One Seven G. Stand by with your results. I'll contact.#
KIRK: Kirk out. Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real. (M4 glides in with a bag of purple crystals and puts it on the table. It leaves) KIRK: Easy. Bones?#
KIRK: Beam up to the ship and start processing.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Flint. I don't think we have the time.#
KIRK: I thought you lived alone.#
KIRK: Rayna.#
KIRK: Why not all three? (M4 leads McCoy into a lab, then disappears through a door. McCoy examines the large coloured jars on a table whilst M4 works behind an opaque window) (Rayna sends the cue ball around all four cushions to hit both reds. Billiards) KIRK: Did you teach her that?#
KIRK: You said something about savagery, Mister Flint. When was the last time you visited Earth?#
KIRK: Thank you. Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn. Indeed, your greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence.#
KIRK: Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him to what you call savagery. The private hells, the inner needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct. As human beings, that is the way it is. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness from within and from without. (While Rayna is very close to Kirk, Spock is at a gold carved grand piano)#
KIRK: May I have the pleasure?#
KIRK: Is something wrong?#
KIRK: Time factor, Bones? Epidemic?#
KIRK: But would we have made the error?#
KIRK: Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures.#
KIRK: Later, Spock.#
KIRK: I think I will go to the laboratory. There may be a way of reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin. Stay here. Let me know when Flint and McCoy return. Captain's log, stardate 5843.75. Have I committed a grave error in accepting Flint's word that he would deliver the antidote to us? The precious time I have let pass may result in disaster for the Enterprise and her crew.#
KIRK: You left us. The room became lonely.#
KIRK: What? What's in there?#
KIRK: Then why are you here?#
KIRK: Are you troubled now?#
KIRK: By what? Are you happy here with Flint?#
KIRK: Then why are you afraid?  Don't be afraid. (Kirk kisses Rayna. M4 enters and Rayna is scared. Kirk pushes her away)#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock.#
KIRK: If it were around right now, it would correct#
KIRK: In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power.#
KIRK: I don't like the way he orders her around.#
KIRK: He loves her?#
KIRK: Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together. The billiard game. He suggested we dance.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Report on the Rigelian fever.#
KIRK: Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec. Status, legal ward after the death of her parents.#
KIRK: Kirk out, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Can you confirm that, Mister Spock?#
KIRK: Time factor.#
KIRK: What's keeping the processing this time?#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: No award of custody?#
KIRK: Kirk out. Like Flint. People without a past. What hold does he have over her?#
KIRK: Let's find McCoy.#
KIRK: I'll meet you in the lab.#
KIRK: I don't want to say goodbye.#
KIRK: Come with me. I offer you happiness.#
KIRK: Childhood must end. You love me, not Flint.#
KIRK: Why is Flint playing tricks on us? Apparently we're supposed to go in and get it, if we can. Well, let's not disappoint the chess master. Phasers on full.#
KIRK: Why you?#
KIRK: Let's find out.#
KIRK: We'll all go.#
KIRK: Spock, you knew?#
KIRK:: You brought me here to learn this? Does she know?#
KIRK: Let's go.#
KIRK: Why?#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. (We see Flint press a button, and the Enterprise disappear from its orbit) KIRK: Clear out of the area. Inform Starfleet Command. Enterprise? Scotty?#
KIRK: My crew.#
KIRK: You'd wipe out four hundred lives? Why?#
KIRK: Worse than dead! Restore them. Restore my ship!#
KIRK: What needs?#
KIRK: Give me back my ship. Your secret is safe with us.#
KIRK: That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn. You realised what was happening. You kept us together, Rayna and me, because you knew I could bring her emotions alive. And now you�re just going to take over.#
KIRK: Impossible? Impossible. From the beginning, you used me. I can't love her, but I do love her. And she loves me.#
KIRK: Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman.#
KIRK: She's human. Down to the last blood cell, she's human. Down to the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, she�s human. The human spirit is free. You have no power of ownership. She's free to do as she wishes.#
KIRK: I don't want to beat you. This is no test of power. Rayna belongs to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills, to do as she wills, to think as she wills.#
KIRK: Rayna, come with me.#
KIRK: What happened?#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: A very old and lonely man. And a young and lonely man. We put on a pretty poor show, didn't we? If only I could forget.#
KIRK: Spock, any answers?#
KIRK: Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there.#
KIRK: Lieutenant, anything from the planet?#
KIRK: Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the planet. Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and investigate further. We are therefore going on to our next assignment.#
KIRK: Prepare to warp us out.#
KIRK: Alert status.#
KIRK: Uhura#
KIRK: I recognise what you appear to be.#
KIRK: Spock.#
KIRK: I was requesting your analysis, Spock.#
KIRK: We'd be honoured to have you aboard, Mister President.#
KIRK: We can convert to it, sir.#
KIRK:  Thank you, Mister Mulney.#
KIRK: Magnification four, helm.#
KIRK: Security, send a detachment to the transporter room immediately, phaser side arms, and be prepared to give presidential honours.#
KIRK: It's obvious he believes it. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock, full dress uniforms.#
KIRK: If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is actually coming aboard, but we're dealing with an unknown and apparently highly advanced life-form. Until we know, when in Rome, we'll do as the Romans do.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, take tricorder readings and see if it is human. Appropriate ruffles and flourishes, Mister Spock. Security, stand ready.#
KIRK: Energise. (A tall, lean figure in a black frock coat is beamed aboard to drum beat and a bosun's whistle) KIRK: The USS Enterprise is honoured to have you aboard, Mister President.#
KIRK: That's taped music, sir. A starship on active duty never carries an honour detachment.#
KIRK: An energy-matter scrambler, sir. The molecules in your body are converted into energy, then beamed into this chamber and reconverted back into their original pattern.#
KIRK: Mister President, may I present my officers. Commander Spock, second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer Dickerson.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters. Mister President.#
KIRK: Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high. We're six hundred and forty three miles above the surface of this planet.#
KIRK: Yes, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura.#
KIRK: We've each learned to be delighted with what we are. The Vulcans learned that centuries before we did.#
KIRK: Certainly. Our engineering officer#
KIRK: Oh, dear. If you�ll forgive me, our communications officer#
KIRK: Forgive me again. We'll rejoin you shortly.#
KIRK: Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen.#
KIRK: I doubt that, Bones, but continue.#
KIRK: Yes, of course he's an alien. MCCOY And he's potentially dangerous.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, as you know, Mister Spock and I have been invited to beam down to the planet surface with him. Any comments on that?#
KIRK: But why would he want to kill only two of us?#
KIRK: Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that?#
KIRK: But not only to me, Spock.#
KIRK: The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life. Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we have been offered contact. Therefore, I shall beam down. Mister Spock, as for you#
KIRK: And you're on the edge of insubordination.#
KIRK: Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated. Mister Spock, standard dress, tricorders and phasers. We will guide President Lincoln to the transporter room. We'll beam down immediately.#
KIRK: Standing by, Mister Scott.#
KIRK: All right, Mister Scott, energise.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in.#
KIRK: Your explanation, sir?#
KIRK: Why were our weapons taken? Why can't we communicate with our ship?#
KIRK: The game is over. We've treated you with courtesy. We've gone along with what and who you think you are.#
KIRK: Who?#
KIRK: Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer.#
KIRK: We know nothing of your world or your customs. What do you mean, drama about to unfold?#
KIRK: We perceive we were invited to come here, and we came in friendship. And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel.#
KIRK: What do you mean, survival?#
KIRK: Mister Spock and I refuse to participate.#
KIRK: Analysis, Spock. Why do they want us to fight?#
KIRK: And they'll get their answers if it kills us.#
KIRK: What do you want?#
KIRK: You're somewhat different than the way history paints you, Colonel Green.#
KIRK: Where do you come from?#
KIRK: What do you propose?#
KIRK: Anyone hurt?#
KIRK: Mister Spock?#
KIRK: No, I think Colonel Green is right. That rock-like thing is our enemy, not those illusions.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in.#
KIRK: Scotty, do you read me?#
KIRK: Scotty, beam us up fast.#
KIRK: What if they defeat us?#
KIRK: Scotty, inform Starfleet Command. Disengage nacelles, Jettison if possible. Mister Spock, assist them. Advise and analyse. Scotty? Scotty?#
KIRK: There's nothing immoral about fighting an illusion, Mister Spock. We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and all the crewmen aboard.#
KIRK: We'll use this as a base. It's defensible. They can't approach without being seen.#
KIRK: No, we don't have time. But if things go against us, I want a place to retreat to. What I want to do now is scout them out, find their weaknesses and attack.#
KIRK: Occasionally. Why?#
KIRK: Thank you. Thank you. Mister Spock, we'll need weapons. I believe the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang?#
KIRK: And slings and spears. Slings. Mister President. You used a sling as a boy.#
KIRK: We don't have much time, Spock.#
KIRK: Circumstances were different then, Surak.#
KIRK: I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here.#
KIRK: My ship is at stake.#
KIRK: So are mine, Spock. If I believed that there was a peaceful way out of this#
KIRK: You saw how treacherously they acted.#
KIRK: I have no authority over you. You may do as you think best.#
KIRK: The weapons, gentlemen. In case he fails.#
KIRK: Your Surak is a brave man.#
KIRK: You show emotion, Spock.#
KIRK: I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon.#
KIRK: Surak?#
KIRK: Yes, I know that.#
KIRK: I should never have let him go.#
KIRK: How can you ignore that?#
KIRK: Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony.#
KIRK: But you can just listen to it and do nothing. I can't.#
KIRK: I can�t just let him stay there.#
KIRK: Do what they want, sir?#
KIRK: And what will you do?#
KIRK: No.#
KIRK: I can't let you risk it, Mister President.#
KIRK: Your campaign, Mister President.#
KIRK: Mister Lincoln!#
KIRK: You established the methods and the goals.#
KIRK: What did you offer the others if they won?#
KIRK: You offered me the lives of my crew.#
KIRK: How many others have you done this to? What gives you the right to hand out life and death?#
KIRK: We came in peace.#
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: Yes, Mister Sulu. We're all right. You may beam us aboard.#
KIRK: Mister Scott, report.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu.#
KIRK: Good. Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Chekov. Mister Spock, any explanation?#
KIRK: Well?#
KIRK: They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel I actually met Lincoln.#
KIRK: It was so hard for me to see him die again. I feel I understand what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace.#
KIRK: There's still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy, Spock. Mister Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next assignment.#
KIRK: Any sign of survivors?#
KIRK: If they knew that their sun was dying, it could be anything up to mass suicide.#
KIRK: Then we're certainly in the right place to find out what happened, where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now.#
KIRK: Perhaps you can, Mister#
KIRK: You say everyone is gone? Where'd they go?#
KIRK: What about recent history?#
KIRK: It doesn't have to be extensive, Just the answers to a few questions.#
KIRK: You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz. Just how many of you are there? We came as soon as we knew what was happening.#
KIRK: Did you say they were safe?#
KIRK: Where did they go?#
KIRK: I see. And you personally sent all these people on the planet to safety?#
KIRK: You are the real one, Mister Atoz? KIRK: Of course. I am the real Mister Atoz.#
KIRK: Let us take you with us to a place of safety.#
KIRK: We'll choose it as quick as we can. How long till nova?#
KIRK: This gentleman is not#
KIRK: Spock. Bones.#
KIRK: I'm a free man, sir.#
KIRK: What's that? Are you all right?#
KIRK: You better come back with me to the library. You'll be safe there. Doctor McCoy can see to those bruises.#
KIRK: It's right over there.#
KIRK: No. Do you remember when you first saw me? Do you remember whether I came through some kind of door?#
KIRK: No. No. It must be here someplace.#
KIRK: Bones? Spock?#
KIRK: We must've missed each other somehow.#
KIRK: No, no. No, no, no. These are friends of mine, and they're#
KIRK: Can you get to the library?#
KIRK: Explain.#
KIRK: It must have been tied in to the tape viewer somehow.#
KIRK: Yes.  My friends are coming back with reinforcements.#
KIRK: On what charge?#
KIRK: That's a mistake. I'm no thief.#
KIRK: Keep talking!#
KIRK: I'm a stranger.#
KIRK: An island.#
KIRK: It's called Earth.#
KIRK: I never saw that woman before tonight. When she screamed, as far as I could tell, she was being attacked.#
KIRK: Yes, I deny it. I was reading in the library when I heard her scream. My lord, the library? Do you remember where the library is, my lord?#
KIRK: Surely you don't believe#
KIRK: What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall in the library. In the library.#
KIRK: My lord, at least arrange for me to meet Mister Atoz.#
KIRK: Yes! Yes! Atoz!#
KIRK: Let me speak to you!#
KIRK: At least let me talk to you!#
KIRK: Cry out and I'll break it. Don't move. (He takes the keys and unlocks his own cell, lets himself out, knocks out the jailor and drags in inside, shutting the door behind him. The Judge comes down the steps)#
KIRK: I'm being falsely accused. You know that.#
KIRK: There are no such things as witches!#
KIRK: You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth. There are no witches. Why do you deny it?#
KIRK: I'll denounce you to the inquisitor. You came here from the future just as I did. Therefore, you, too, are a witch.#
KIRK: Then help me.#
KIRK: Help me return to the library. I've lost my way. I must get back there.#
KIRK: I tell you I must! I had two friends with me, who are lost in another time period. I must find them. You'll come back with us.#
KIRK: Prepared? I was not prepared. Your Mister Atoz did not prepare me in any way.#
KIRK: Spock? McCoy? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.#
KIRK: How much time before the sun blows up?#
KIRK: We can't, Scotty. Spock and McCoy are missing.#
KIRK: No. Under no circumstances send anyone else here without my orders. Prepare to warp out and stand by. Kirk out. Mister Atoz, where are you?#
KIRK: No. Mister Atoz, my friends and I are from another planet. We don't belong in your history. We don't belong on your planet at all.#
KIRK: No. I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing.#
KIRK: I'm sorry, Mister Atoz. Mister Atoz!#
KIRK: I'll let you out in a minute. Still up to your little game of replicas? Which are you this time, real or not?#
KIRK: If you help me, we won't die. I promise you that.#
KIRK: Which one are you now, the replica or the real one?#
KIRK: You don't really want to hurt me, do you? You've been trying to save my life. I realise that. Put that thing away.#
KIRK: Now, you're going to help me look for my friends.#
KIRK: Kirk here.#
KIRK: No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out?#
KIRK: Stand by to beam us up. But when that star explodes, don't wait. Get out fast. Kirk out. Now we're going to start looking. They were in a frozen waste. I could hear the wind.#
KIRK: We'll both look, Mister Atoz.#
KIRK: I don�t know.#
KIRK: I didn't see it.#
KIRK: Bones? Spock! McCoy! You've got the wrong one.#
KIRK: Try again.#
KIRK: Bones. Spock!#
KIRK: I've found them. Can you still hear me?#
KIRK: Follow my voice.#
KIRK: What are you waiting for? Hurry!#
KIRK: What are you waiting for? Hurry!#
KIRK: Scotty, how much time is there?#
KIRK: What's the matter? Why can't he get through?#
KIRK: Spock, McCoy, you can't get through unless you both come back at the same time. Scotty.#
KIRK: No! Wait!#
KIRK: He had his escape planned. I'm glad he made it. Kirk to Enterprise.#
KIRK: Scotty, are you there?#
KIRK: Beam us aboard and go to maximum warp as soon as we're there. Kirk out.#
KIRK: What's wrong with her?#
KIRK: Janice, you must remain absolutely quiet. Those are doctor's orders, not mine.#
KIRK: I don't blame you.#
KIRK: I never stopped you from going on with your space work.#
KIRK: No, it isn't. And you punished and tortured me because of it.#
KIRK: We'd have killed each other.#
KIRK: You had your chance, Captain Kirk. You should've smothered the life in me. Then they would have said Doctor Janice Lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty. Why didn't you do it? You always wanted to. Didn't you? You had the strength to do it. But you were afraid. You were always afraid. Now Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk. I already possess your physical strength. Only this Captain Kirk is not afraid to kill. Now you know the indignity of being a woman. For you this agony will soon pass, as it has for me. Quiet. Quiet! Believe me, it's better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman. It's better to be dead. (He makes to strangle her with her own scarf, but is interrupted by the sound of footsteps) KIRK: Doctor McCoy, your report.#
KIRK: Was it radiation as suggested?#
KIRK: No, nothing at all. She was unconscious all of the time.#
KIRK: Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem.#
KIRK: Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. Captain Kirk to the Enterprise.#
KIRK: Mister Scott. Prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two others. One critically ill. Have a medical team standing by to receive the patient. Captain Kirk, out. Prepare to beam aboard.#
KIRK: Doctor Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay. Mister Spock, take the ship out of orbit. Resume designated course. Doctor McCoy. Doctor McCoy, you and Doctor Coleman seem to disagree on diagnosis.#
KIRK: Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment?#
KIRK: Well, this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons.#
KIRK: Oh, yes. It's been a long time since I saw her. I walked out on her when it became serious.#
KIRK: Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor McCoy. It's a very unhappy memory for me.#
KIRK: Thank you. Thank you very much.#
KIRK: Yes, very lucky. Very lucky.#
KIRK: Well you'd better put a stop to it! If you allow Doctor Lester to become fully conscious she'll know what has happened.#
KIRK: Probably?#
KIRK: I tell you it can't continue.#
KIRK: There wasn't enough time.#
KIRK: He hung onto life too hard. I couldn't#
KIRK: Love? Him? I love the life he led. The power of a starship commander. It's my life now.#
KIRK: You are a murderer! You knew it was celebium. You could've treated them for it. You're a murderer many times over.#
KIRK: I thought my presence might quiet Doctor Lester. It seems to have had the opposite effect.#
KIRK: Didn't Doctor Lester's staff become delirious before they went off and died?#
KIRK: Doctor Coleman, Doctor McCoy has had a great deal of experience with radiation exposure on board the Enterprise. I am guided by his opinion.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you off the case and turn it over to Doctor Coleman.#
KIRK: Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility. Let him do it.#
KIRK: It's done! Doctor Coleman, your patient. Doctor Coleman, didn't you suggest a sedation to rest the patient?#
KIRK: Doctor Coleman.#
KIRK: Course, Mister Chekov.#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, set speed at warp factor two.#
KIRK: Mister Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony.#
KIRK: How long to the colony at our present speed?#
KIRK: Mister Sulu, set course for the colony. Three seven three mark eight.#
KIRK: Yes, it can't be helped. We must take Doctor Lester to a place where she can be treated.#
KIRK: How long to Starbase Two?#
KIRK: It's twenty four hours too long. Doctor Lester's condition is increasingly serious. Continue present course.#
KIRK: They will have to serve.#
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use if Doctor Lester's dead. Time is of the essence. Continue present course.#
KIRK: No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant. Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed. Our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved! That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, if you�d concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible, Starfleet Command would've been informed already.#
KIRK: Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant.#
KIRK: Continue present course. Increase speed to warp factor six.#
KIRK: Why are you being so defensive? There's no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case.#
KIRK: That's the opinion of an individual.#
KIRK: There are no administrative duties required here.#
KIRK: Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred. You know that, Bones.#
KIRK: I'm afraid the order will have to stand. I can only say that Doctor Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here. I�m sure that you can appreciate that.#
KIRK: What? What do you base that on?#
KIRK: You'll never make that charge stick. Any fool can see why you're doing this.#
KIRK: I won't submit to this petty search for revenge!#
KIRK: Captain Kirk here.#
KIRK: I'll be right there.#
KIRK: Well, gentlemen. I'm here, Doctor.#
KIRK: She might have killed someone.#
KIRK: Put her in isolation in her room. Maintain a twenty four hour watch. No one, absolutely no one, is to talk to her without my permission!#
KIRK: How am I otherwise?#
KIRK: Good. I hope you're as pleased about it as I am.#
KIRK: You said I was in perfect condition.#
KIRK: I don't think another test is necessary.#
KIRK: Well, are you satisfied with the results of the tests?#
KIRK: No hard feelings, Bones. You did your usual thorough, good job.#
KIRK: Captain Kirk here.#
KIRK: Captain Kirk to Security. On the double to Doctor Lester's room!#
KIRK: Phasers.#
KIRK: Attention, all personnel. First Officer Spock has been placed under arrest. He has conspired with Doctor Lester to take over the ship from your captain. A hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of a general court martial on the charge of mutiny. Captain's Log, stardate 5930.3. The results of Doctor McCoy's examination have given me complete confidence in myself. My fears are past. I shall function freely as the captain. I am the captain of the Enterprise, in fact.#
KIRK: She's dangerously insane. We've seen the evidence.#
KIRK: Mister Spock. Mister Spock, my authority has been given to me by Starfleet Command, and only that high authority can take it away.#
KIRK: Mister Lemli, have Doctor Janice Lester brought here.#
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, while Mister Spock was busy with his ambitious plot, what were you doing?#
KIRK: Oh, yes. You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and physical, since leaving Camus Two. Is that correct?#
KIRK: Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to help me. Doctor McCoy, for the record, will you tell the court your findings?#
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock, were you aware of Doctor McCoy's findings?#
KIRK: And what have you to say now?#
KIRK: Doctor Coleman, if you�re required here, we'll call you.#
KIRK: We certainly appreciate your being here. Everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress. We had hoped to avoid any further stress, but Mister Spock disagrees. It is his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case. And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision, I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions. I'll try not to upset you. You claim that, that you are Captain James T. Kirk?#
KIRK: Oh. Well. However, as I understand it, I am Doctor Janice Lester.#
KIRK: A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement.#
KIRK: Violence by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk? I ask the assembled personnel to look at Doctor Janice Lester and visualise that historic moment. Can you, can you tell me why Doctor Janice Lester would agree to this ludicrous exchange?#
KIRK: Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do.#
KIRK: Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Doctor Janice Lester?#
KIRK: Oh. Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect Starfleet Command to place this er, this er, person in command of the Enterprise?#
KIRK: And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain, and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then you would be the captain! It is inevitable! Spock. Spock, give it up! Return to the Enterprise family. All charges will be dropped and the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on Camus Two will fade and be forgotten.#
KIRK: Doctor Lester will be cared for always. It is a debt and a responsibility I owe her from the past.#
KIRK: Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Mister Spock's tirade.#
KIRK: You heard the statements placed into the record by you. Do you understand the nature of it?#
KIRK:  It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base! But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny. Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, you heard it! On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote, by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise. A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote.#
KIRK: Silence. You will be silent! A recess has been declared. There will be no cross-discussion. When I return, we will vote on the charge of mutiny. The evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision.#
KIRK: Play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor.#
KIRK: Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers. And you're so charged. The sentence, death. Mister Lemli.#
KIRK: All my senior officers turning against me?#
KIRK: I am responsible. The execution will be immediate. Go to your posts. Go to your posts.#
KIRK: Mister Lemli, take them to the brig. Prepare for execution. Go on! (Scott and McCoy are escorted out at phaser point. Janice follows and Spock follow, also under armed guard)#
KIRK: Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision. Have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck. Mister Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony?#
KIRK: Plot co-ordinates for orbit. Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished. Interment will take place on Benecia.#
KIRK: You have received your orders! You will obey my orders. You�ll be charged with mutiny! You will obey my orders or, or,#
KIRK: Arthur, the transference is weakening.#
KIRK: For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners. I will not go back to being Janice Lester. You must help me prevent it.#
KIRK: I can't. I can't. The crew is in mutiny. You must kill her for me.#
KIRK: Then do it for yourself. If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be exposed as murderers. Does that give you any choice?#
KIRK: The dosage should be doubly lethal.#
KIRK: To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate cells. If there�s any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn co-operation. Doctor Lester will be first. Follow Doctor Coleman.#
KIRK: Kill him! Kill him! (Then Kirk goes into another convulsion. The rest of the prisoners stroll into the corridor as the transfer undoes itself)#
KIRK: Can you do anything for her?#
KIRK: I didn't want to destroy her.#
KIRK: Her life could have been as rich as any woman's, if only. If only.#
