MCCOY: Just a few seconds more.#
MCCOY: That's a boy. Keep it up. Work up a little sweat, it'll will do you good.#
MCCOY: Stop. Winded?#
MCCOY: Finally finished a physical on you, didn't I.  What am I, a doctor or a moon shuttle conductor? If I jumped every time a light came on around here, I'd end up talking to myself.#
MCCOY: Same report.#
MCCOY: Your timing is lousy, Jim.#
MCCOY: Your men are tired.#
MCCOY: I never say that.#
MCCOY: I'm especially worried about Bailey. Navigator's position's rough enough for a seasoned man.#
MCCOY: Oh? How so sure? Because you spotted something you liked in him, something familiar, like yourself say about, oh, eleven years ago?#
MCCOY: I don't need textbooks to know you could've promoted him too fast. Listen to that voice.#
MCCOY: Well, they're not. After what they've been through they really should#
MCCOY: No, I never say that, either.#
MCCOY: What are you going to do with that six percent when they give it to you, Jim?#
MCCOY: Your weight was up a couple of pounds, remember?#
MCCOY: No, no. No, I never eat until the crew eats.#
MCCOY: What's the matter, Jim. Don't you trust yourself?#
MCCOY: Balok's message. It was heard all over the ship.#
MCCOY: Easy, Bailey.#
MCCOY: Practically end of watch.#
MCCOY: Let's go.#
MCCOY: Assuming we get out of this, Captain#
MCCOY: Well, then about Bailey. Let me enter it in my medical records as simple fatigue.#
MCCOY: And your mistake. You overworked him, pushed him, expected too much from him.#
MCCOY: I intend to challenge your actions in my records. I'll state that I warned you about Bailey's condition. Now that's no bluff.#
MCCOY: For having other things on your mind? My fault. I don't how the devil you keep from punching me in the face.#
MCCOY: Love to teach it to you.#
MCCOY: I thought the power was off in the galley.#
MCCOY: Jim, don't you think#
MCCOY: No, but you won't let that stop you.#
MCCOY: And your crew?#
MCCOY: You're aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.#
MCCOY: Never trusted this.#
MCCOY: Yes. Yes, they are.#
MCCOY: Amen to that, Scotty.#
MCCOY: Why, yes, please do. By all means. Connors, are you finished?#
MCCOY: Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please?#
MCCOY: My medical scanner.#
MCCOY: Oh no. I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me. Just walk by, please.  It's not supposed to do that.#
MCCOY: Yes, if they need it.#
MCCOY: What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them.#
MCCOY: Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something radioactive, my dear?#
MCCOY: I wonder what makes it do that.#
MCCOY: She refused.#
MCCOY: Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound, measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is it that they just, well, act beautiful. No. Strike that, strike that.#
MCCOY: You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing?#
MCCOY: No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going beep!#
MCCOY: I don't either.#
MCCOY: That must have been quite a talk you made down there. Ever try considering the patent medicine business?#
MCCOY: Smack right in the old heart. Oh, I'm sorry. In your case, it would be about here.#
MCCOY: You picked a good day, Fisher. Business has been lousy. What'd you do, take a fall on purpose so you could get a little vacation?#
MCCOY: What can I do for you, Jim?#
MCCOY: Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go.#
MCCOY: He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a tranquilizer of any kind. I think we'd better bind him.#
MCCOY: You have a point, Spock?#
MCCOY: It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that, Spock?#
MCCOY: You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that!#
MCCOY: Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process. A fact I failed to consider.#
MCCOY: I don't know, Jim.#
MCCOY: Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll join you.#
MCCOY: Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our darker side. We need it! It's half of what we are. It's not really ugly, it's human.#
MCCOY: Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him.#
MCCOY: You have the goodness.#
MCCOY: The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For you see, he was afraid and you weren't.#
MCCOY: He's dead, Jim. Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Entry made by Second Officer Spock. Captain Kirk retains command of this vessel, but his force of will rapidly fading. Condition of landing party critical. Transporter unit still under repair.#
MCCOY: Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know. Animal could have died of some kind of shock.#
MCCOY: I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem.#
MCCOY: Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again.#
MCCOY: Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway. Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory!#
MCCOY: Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours.#
MCCOY: No!#
MCCOY: He  attacked him.#
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock?  Jim?#
MCCOY:  Severe exposure and frostbite, but I think they'll make it. How do you feel, Jim?#
MCCOY: Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them? There doesn't seem to be anybody around, does there.#
MCCOY: Yeah, a little bit, I guess. You see, we walked out of each other's lives ten years ago. She married Crater, and for all I know she may have forgotten me completely. Of all the bonehead ideas, Jim, how'd I let myself in for things like this?#
MCCOY: Nancy.#
MCCOY: It's good to see you.#
MCCOY: You haven't aged a day. Oh, this is Captain Jim Kirk of the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: And Crewman Darnell.#
MCCOY: A little less mouth, Darnell.#
MCCOY: Plum.#
MCCOY: I'll, er, I'll wait for the professor and I'll catch you both at once.#
MCCOY: I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that fact.#
MCCOY: What you want is unimportant right now. What you will get is required by the book.#
MCCOY: Sit down and breathe deeply, please.#
MCCOY: You did.#
MCCOY: That's me. Didn't she mention I was here?#
MCCOY: Well, it certainly hasn't aged her. She looks exactly as I knew her twelve years ago. Amazing, Jim. Like a girl of twenty five.#
MCCOY: I'm not joking, Jim. She hasn't aged a day. She doesn't have a grey hair on her head.#
MCCOY: Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty.#
MCCOY: Open your mouth.#
MCCOY: The machine is capable of almost anything but I'll still put my trust in a healthy set of tonsils. Now, open your mouth. (a woman screams, they dash out, Kirk with his phaser drawn) [Planet surface]#
MCCOY: Dead, Jim. Strange. A red mottling all over his face.#
MCCOY: Take it easy, Nancy. Just tell us what you know.#
MCCOY: No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's something entirely different. Jim, I suppose we could complete these examinations later.#
MCCOY: She called it a Borgia plant.#
MCCOY: Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned.#
MCCOY: She's mistaken. I know alkaloid poison, what to look for. There's not a trace of it in his body.#
MCCOY: Jim, don't tell me my business. He could not have swallowed any. My instruments would have picked up any trace of it whatsoever.#
MCCOY: I'll tell you something else. This man shouldn't be dead. I can't find anything wrong with him. According to all the tests he should just get up and walk away from here. I don't know. I'll have the tests double-checked. My eyes may be tricking me. I swear, Jim, when I first saw her she looked just as I'd known her ten years ago. Granted, for a moment I may have been looking at her through a romantic haze.#
MCCOY: Yes, sir. Captain's log, Stardate 1513.4. In orbit around planet M-113. One crewman, member of the landing party, dead by violence. Cause unknown, but we are certain the cause of death was not poison.#
MCCOY: I'd rather not put it on the speaker.#
MCCOY: So improbable we almost didn't check it.#
MCCOY: This man has no salt in his body at all.#
MCCOY: I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his.#
MCCOY: Except the red rings on his face.#
MCCOY: I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part.#
MCCOY: Oh, forget it. I probably was mooning over her. I should have been thinking about my job.#
MCCOY: Salt tablets.#
MCCOY: Our crewman died of salt depletion. Sudden, total loss of it. Medically impossible by any standards.#
MCCOY:  Salt.#
MCCOY: Jim, he's run off.#
MCCOY: Jim! Jim, it's Sturgeon. He's dead.#
MCCOY: Crewman Green, report! Green! Green, where are you? Could it be Crater? He came this way.#
MCCOY: Same red rings on his face. Have you seen Nancy, Mrs. Crater?#
MCCOY: I'm worried about her, Jim. She's not at the quarters, she's not at the diggings. She could be in trouble. Nancy!#
MCCOY: Nancy, it's Leonard!#
MCCOY: You can't leave her!#
MCCOY: Jim!#
MCCOY: All right, Jim.#
MCCOY: McCoy to Bridge. Captain there?#
MCCOY: Nope.#
MCCOY: Nancy. Well, come in. come in. I've been worried sick about you. I wonder why Jim didn't tell me he found you.#
MCCOY: Well.#
MCCOY: Nancy, er#
MCCOY: You're as bad as Jim Kirk. He's been telling me to take these.#
MCCOY:  I was so worried. Your husband acting strange, crewmen dying.#
MCCOY: The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu?#
MCCOY: Or whatever it is that's killing the crewmen. Perhaps I can help. Fill me in. [Planet surface - ruins]#
MCCOY: Yes?#
MCCOY: Oh. Well, we could offer it salt without tricks. There's no reason for it to attack us.#
MCCOY: No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability to take other forms.#
MCCOY: And like us, it's an intelligent animal. There's no need to hunt it down.#
MCCOY: Well, I resist using it, but in this case the professor will give us the truth.#
MCCOY: Oh, yes. Of course.#
MCCOY: Easy, easy. Nobodies going to#
MCCOY: What's going on here, Jim?#
MCCOY: Are you insane?#
MCCOY: It?#
MCCOY: No!#
MCCOY: You're frightening her, Jim.#
MCCOY: Stop it, Jim!#
MCCOY: Are you out of your mind?#
MCCOY: No! No!#
MCCOY: I won't shoot Nancy.#
MCCOY: Stop it! Stop it, Spock! Stop it! (Nancy sends Spock flying with one slap)#
MCCOY: No.  No! (She transforms into her natural state.;Kirk screams, McCoy fires the phaser, she changes back into Nancy)#
MCCOY: Lord, forgive me.#
MCCOY: You're fine, Joe. Up and out of there. Mister Spock? Your pulse is two hundred and forty two, your blood pressure is practically nonexistent, assuming you call that green stuff in your veins blood.#
MCCOY: They're fine, Jim.#
MCCOY: Oh, thank you, Christine.#
MCCOY: Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively.#
MCCOY: Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing.#
MCCOY: This shouldn't be happening. This man should be getting stronger. You sure the respirator's functioning properly?#
MCCOY: Why is this man dying? Hypo.#
MCCOY: The wounds were not that severe.#
MCCOY: Intestinal damage wasn't that severe. I got to him in plenty of time. That man should still be alive. The only reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live. He gave up.#
MCCOY: Well, that may be. Maybe. I've lost patients before, but not like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up.#
MCCOY: You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're gonna ask me if it's connected.#
MCCOY: Jim, he was decontaminated. He's been medically checked. We've run every test we know for everything we know.#
MCCOY: Well, we're doing everything that's possible.#
MCCOY: Sickbay to Bridge.#
MCCOY: I'm getting you, Jim. Look, can you keep this beast level? I've got Sulu tranquillized and we're running tests on him.#
MCCOY: Negative, until I can get a little farther on these tests.#
MCCOY: Biopsy lab. Biopsy, where's my report? Biopsy, come in! Harrison, where's my report? I'm going to the lab.#
MCCOY: Yes?#
MCCOY: Oh, good. I'll need him conscious now. Continue to examine him on circuits K one and three.#
MCCOY: McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.#
MCCOY: It's water. Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex chain of molecules.#
MCCOY: That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through perspiration. Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses the centres of judgment, self-control. Now get someone to the lab. Tell them the serum works, and start preparing more.#
MCCOY: Release him.#
MCCOY: We found a cure. We're over that part of it.#
MCCOY: Tell me. The ship's supply of food concentrates couldn't have lasted fourteen years.#
MCCOY: And you learned to talk by just listening to the ship's tapes?#
MCCOY: You're four-oh.#
MCCOY: Four-oh. One hundred percent. Sound of wind and limb.#
MCCOY: Yeah.#
MCCOY: Because that's your name.#
MCCOY: Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie.#
MCCOY: Why not?#
MCCOY: Most seventeen year olds do. Come on, let's go. I'll show you to your quarters.#
MCCOY: But tell me, what reason would he have to lie if there are Thasians?#
MCCOY: Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image like you? He already looks up to you.#
MCCOY: By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables.#
MCCOY: And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock. MCCOY: Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally?#
MCCOY: And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim.#
MCCOY: No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like Earthlings. The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the present development of mans on Earth.#
MCCOY: Considering the effect a normal adolescent has on a home, Charlie with the power he has#
MCCOY: Well, what do we do with this boy, Jim? How do we keep him caged up?#
MCCOY: Well, for the moment he's stopped. You're an authority he respects, Jim.#
MCCOY: What's going on here? Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into some kind of poetry.#
MCCOY: You don't have any special immunity. Not anymore. Pushed far enough, he'd send you off to oblivion, too.#
MCCOY: Risky, Jim.#
MCCOY: There was a call for you from the Bridge.#
MCCOY: You're discussing tactics. Do you realise what this really comes down to? Millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel does.#
MCCOY: Based on what? Memories of a war over a century ago? On theories about a people we've never even met face to face?#
MCCOY: War is never imperative, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Amen to that. We're taking a big gamble, Jim.#
MCCOY: Do we violate the treaty, Captain?#
MCCOY: Once inside, they can claim we did. A set-up. They want war, we furnish the provocation.#
MCCOY: Captain, I#
MCCOY: But I've got one. Something I seldom say to a customer, Jim. In this galaxy, there's a mathematical probability of three million Earth-type planets. And in all of the universe, three million million galaxies like this. And in all of that, and perhaps more, only one of each of us. Don't destroy the one named Kirk.#
MCCOY: Only one. Tomlinson. The boy who was getting married this morning. His fianc�e is at the chapel.#
MCCOY: A cage is a cage, Jim.#
MCCOY: And, of course, your people found an answer.#
MCCOY: Abnormal, of course, but it's not schizophrenia, tissue damage, or any condition I'm acquainted with, Jim. And you know after getting him here, it took almost a triple dose of sedative to put him under.#
MCCOY: But not very informative. He claimed one thing, then he seemed to forget, and then he'd start to claim something else, but always with just the ring of truth in it. I'd sure like to study this one, Jim.#
MCCOY: You see what I mean?#
MCCOY: Erased?#
MCCOY: Jim, that doesn't quite ring true.#
MCCOY: I don't believe him. I can't explain it, but the more I study that patient#
MCCOY: Jim#
MCCOY: Jim, listen!#
MCCOY: There are no superior facilities, he knows that. But that's not the question. If something unusual is going on down there#
MCCOY: I'm required to enter any reasonable doubts into my medical log. That requires you to answer in your log. Sorry, Jim.#
MCCOY: Yes, sir. Captain's log, stardate 2715.2. Standard orbit, planet Tantalus V.#
MCCOY: McCoy here. Received and understood.#
MCCOY: Spock, if there's the slightest possibility it might help.#
MCCOY: If there's any way we can look into this man's mind to see if what he's seeing is real or delusion#
MCCOY: Now look, Spock, Jim Kirk could be in real trouble. Will it work or not?#
MCCOY: I understand.  Good, the reading's levelling.#
MCCOY: Jim!#
MCCOY: He's dead, Captain.#
MCCOY: It's hard to believe that a man could die of loneliness.#
MCCOY: Now, this is marvellous. the most horrible conglomeration of antique architecture I've ever seen.#
MCCOY: Of course somebody will fix it.#
MCCOY: A seizure of some type.#
MCCOY: It's dead. It's incredible.#
MCCOY: Its metabolic rate. It's impossibly high as if it's burning itself up, almost as if it aged a century in just the past few minutes.#
MCCOY: I wonder what happened to her, that she should be so terrified of us. (Someone clears a patch of grime from a window, Spock goes over and peers in)#
MCCOY: Foolie?#
MCCOY: You said the Grups got sick. Is that why there aren't any of them around?#
MCCOY: A plague, Captain. That could explain a lot of it.#
MCCOY: That creature which attacked us was certainly no child. Perhaps it died of the disease the girl's talking about.#
MCCOY: A veritable zoo of bacteria. Beam down a biocomputer and a portable electronic microscope. If I'm dealing with viruses, I'll need better equipment than I have here.#
MCCOY: I don't know. Probably the little bugs or whatever they are have no appetite for green blood.#
MCCOY: Spare me the analysis, Mister Spock, please. It is enough that it works.#
MCCOY: Life prolongation. Didn't have much luck, did they? Captain's Log. Doctor McCoy's biocomputer and a portable electronic microscope have been beamed down from the Enterprise. They will be used in conjunction with computer banks on-board ship.#
MCCOY: Tubular with extreme multiplicability. Appear to have affinity for nucleic acids. Give me what you have.#
MCCOY: Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of course you know that. Why?#
MCCOY: Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be.#
MCCOY: But how do they keep the line going?#
MCCOY: She likes you, Jim.#
MCCOY: Answers it very well.#
MCCOY: A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us could have been just like Miri. A child entering puberty on this planet means a death sentence.#
MCCOY: Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other, till the last of us finally destroys himself.#
MCCOY: What about us?#
MCCOY: No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it. It's progressing. We'll begin to feel it inside soon. Intense fever, great pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision. Of course, those are the early symptoms. There'll be more.#
MCCOY: I think I've found it.#
MCCOY: Only one half intact.#
MCCOY: More or less. The idea was to create a new series of diseases, a chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the human cell immeasurably.#
MCCOY: Is that all, Captain? We have five days, you know.#
MCCOY: Jim, We've absolutely got to have those communicators. Without them, we don't have the computers, and without the computers, we don't have a chance. Captain's Log, stardate 2717.3. Three days, seven hours left to us. Investigation proves that the supply of food in the area is running dangerously low. Unless something is done, the children will starve in a few months. The disease is working on each of us according to Doctor McCoy's prediction. Our tempers are growing short, and We're no further along than we were two days ago.#
MCCOY: Would you like to take a crack at it?#
MCCOY: The last slide I examined, I failed to make the necessary adjustment. The slowing down of my own responses#
MCCOY: The disease, Captain, the one they created three hundred years ago.#
MCCOY: A chance. At least it's a race now, and we've just wasted a minute.#
MCCOY: It looks right.#
MCCOY: But the question is, what's the dosage?#
MCCOY: That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it without the ship's computers.#
MCCOY: That's what the computers will tell us.#
MCCOY: We can't wait for those communicators any longer.#
MCCOY: The disease certainly is. How long do we have left? Hours, minutes? How much longer do you want to wait?#
MCCOY: Spock!#
MCCOY: And truant officers, I presume.#
MCCOY: Mister Spock, the man on top walks a lonely street. The chain of command is often a noose.#
MCCOY: Negative. Did you know this is the first time in a week I've had time for a drop of the true? Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: Now I know why they were conquered. What are you so worried about, anyway? I find Jim generally knows what he's doing.#
MCCOY: Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl?#
MCCOY: You would.#
MCCOY: Lots of things go on around here that I don't know, Mister Spock. Now, he's the Captain. He can transfer whoever he pleases. You can look that up in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere. All right? Come on, have a drink.#
MCCOY: You're welcome. But I will. And please, Mister Spock, if you won't join me, don't disapprove of me. At least not until you've tried it, huh?#
MCCOY: I appreciate whatever concern you may have for the ship's company, Mister Spock,#
MCCOY: I've heard of it.#
MCCOY: Unfortunately, he wasn't the first.#
MCCOY: What has Karidian to do with it?#
MCCOY: You think Jim suspects he's Kodos?#
MCCOY: It's unbelievable.#
MCCOY: I'm not sure I can.#
MCCOY: As of this date, lab report indicates presence of appreciable amount of tetralubisol, a highly volatile lubricant in use aboard ship.#
MCCOY: Tetralubisol us a milky substance. Someone could have gotten careless, made a mistake.#
MCCOY: When I've finished logging it.#
MCCOY: My report on Lieutenant Riley.#
MCCOY: He's got a good chance.#
MCCOY: Could have been an accident.#
MCCOY: Jim, Spock's simply trying,#
MCCOY: It's his job, and you know it.#
MCCOY: Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance?#
MCCOY: What if you decide he is Kodos? What then? Do you play God, carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won't bring back the dead, Jim.#
MCCOY: Medical log. Lieutenant Riley's sufficiently recovered to be discharged, but the Captain's ordered him restricted to Sickbay to prevent contact with the passenger who calls himself Karidian and who's suspected of being Kodos the Executioner and of murdering the Lieutenant's family. Captain's log, stardate 2819.8. Suspect under surveillance. Strategic areas under double guard. Performance of the Karidian Players taking place as scheduled.#
MCCOY: In the long history of medicine, no doctor has ever caught the first few minutes of a play. Riley, don't forget to#
MCCOY: Riley? Captain Kirk, McCoy here.#
MCCOY: Riley's gone. I was recording my log about Karidian and Kodos. If he overheard#
MCCOY: Medical report.  She'll receive the best of care, Jim. She remembers nothing. She even thinks her father's still alive giving performances before cheering crowds. You really cared for her, didn't you?#
MCCOY: You're not going to answer my question, are you?#
MCCOY: That's an answer.#
MCCOY: We're being drawn right into it.#
MCCOY: You all right?#
MCCOY: Scotty? Boma?#
MCCOY: Yeoman?#
MCCOY:  Upsy-daisy.#
MCCOY: What happened?#
MCCOY: Partial pressure of oxygen, seventy millimetres of mercury. Nitrogen one forty. Breathable, if you're not running in competition.#
MCCOY: Traces of argon, neon, krypton, all in acceptable quantities. However, I wouldn't recommend this place as a summer resort.#
MCCOY: What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise?#
MCCOY: But they'll be looking for us.#
MCCOY: Then you don't think they'll find us.#
MCCOY: Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's your big chance.#
MCCOY: Command. Oh, I know you, Mister Spock. You've never voiced it, but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to build command. Am I right?#
MCCOY: It'll take more than logic to get us out of this.#
MCCOY: Or the equivalent weight in equipment.#
MCCOY: Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical.#
MCCOY: Not his head, Mister Boma, his heart. His heart.#
MCCOY:  This should save us at least fifty pounds, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind. Now whatever it is that's out there#
MCCOY: I'm not talking about rationality.#
MCCOY: Mister Spock, that's your place.#
MCCOY: Now look. We may all die here. At least let us die like men, not machines.#
MCCOY: Mister Spock! Something's happening outside.#
MCCOY: What do those supersensitive ears make of that, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: Seems logical to me.#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: Right.#
MCCOY: I hope not. Scotty has an idea.#
MCCOY: Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence.#
MCCOY: Just where are you going?#
MCCOY: I don't know. He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind. You tell me.#
MCCOY: Well, it won't unless we get these phasers back. (Further on, Spock finds Gaetano's body draped over a rock. He picks him up in a fireman's lift and heads back to the shuttlecraft with him. Spears are thrown. McCoy and Boma help him get the body inside.)#
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did they?#
MCCOY: You mean they should have respected us?#
MCCOY: Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occur to you they might react emotionally, with anger?#
MCCOY: They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling. You might as well admit it, Mister Spock, your precious logic brought them down on us.#
MCCOY: Studying us, Mister Spock? They seem to learn rather quickly.#
MCCOY: And you've brought our furry friends down on us.#
MCCOY: That won't be long enough.#
MCCOY: It must've worked.#
MCCOY: Mister Boma.#
MCCOY: Don't be a fool, Mister Spock. We couldn't leave you out there.#
MCCOY: We got off!#
MCCOY: Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of your logic.#
MCCOY: After that?#
MCCOY: Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that. Is there anything we can do?#
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command.#
MCCOY: How long have we got now, Scotty?#
MCCOY: It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it was all human.#
MCCOY: That's exactly what I mean. (The front of the little craft starts to glow red, and instrumentation begins to smoke and crackle.)#
MCCOY: Come on, Jim. Let's go.#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: If you have any doubt, that was indeed Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: In these trying times, one of the few. Doctor Leonard McCoy. And you?;#
MCCOY: All of my old friends look like doctors. All of his look like you. Well, you might as well join me for a drink. With this inquiry coming up, he's going to need all the friends he can get.#
MCCOY: I know something about it.#
MCCOY: It's possible.#
MCCOY: He could have.#
MCCOY: No.#
MCCOY: Wait a minute. I don't quite follow you.#
MCCOY: Well, yes, I suppose it could happen.#
MCCOY: Not Captain Kirk.#
MCCOY: But he's not that kind of a man.#
MCCOY: Yes. It's possible.#
MCCOY: Well, I had to see it to believe it.#
MCCOY: They're about to lop off the captain's professional head, and you're sitting here playing chess with the computer.#
MCCOY: Mister Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known.#
MCCOY: That's impossible.#
MCCOY: So you tested the programme bank.#
MCCOY: Well, why are you just sitting there?#
MCCOY: First, the Captain. Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: And lastly, myself.#
MCCOY: Indeed she is.#
MCCOY: What's his problem, Commodore?#
MCCOY: The delta rays?#
MCCOY: They've tried questioning him. He's almost agitated himself into a coma.#
MCCOY: As long as any of us. Blast medicine anyway. We've learned to tie into every human organ in the body except one. The brain. The brain is what life is all about. Now, that man can think any thought that we can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out, and no one can reach in.#
MCCOY: No to what? They could question him for days, weeks, before they stumble on the right thing.#
MCCOY: I don't read you at all, Jim.#
MCCOY: Jim, forgetting how well we both know Spock, the simple fact that he's a Vulcan means he's incapable of telling a lie.#
MCCOY: And that half is completely submerged. To be caught acting like us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him.#
MCCOY: He would not make a false entry.#
MCCOY: I can't, but to question Spock of all people? Me, yes. I could run off half-cocked given a good reason. So could you, but not Spock. It's impossible.#
MCCOY: McCoy here.#
MCCOY: Well, what is it? Sickness? Injury? How bad is it?#
MCCOY: Probably somebody discovered a hangnail. I'll beam up and let you know, Jim.#
MCCOY: What's going on around here? Who said Jim needed a medical rest leave? And this call about me being needed aboard the ship. I've checked everywhere.#
MCCOY: That's right.#
MCCOY: What is this, Spock? Captain, are you all right?  I see that you're still signaling#
MCCOY: I keep wondering who might be after us in a shuttlecraft and I keep coming up with the same answers, but I can't be right, can l, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Is it the captain, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: You what?#
MCCOY: Mister Spock is, er, under arrest. Is confinement to quarters enough?#
MCCOY: Well, confine him.#
MCCOY: I couldn't have prescribed better. We are one weary ship.#
MCCOY: Depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties. You know, you have to see this place to believe it. It's like something out of Alice in Wonderland. The Captain has to come down.#
MCCOY: He needs it. You've got your problems, I've got mine. He's got ours, plus his, plus four hundred and thirty other people's. Where are you going?#
MCCOY: Sulu!#
MCCOY: Did you see them?#
MCCOY: Captain, are you beaming down?#
MCCOY: Well, either our scouting probes and detectors are malfunctioning, and all us scouts careless and beauty-intoxicated, or I must report myself unfit for duty.#
MCCOY: On this supposedly uninhabited planet, I just saw a large rabbit#
MCCOY: As a matter of fact, yes.#
MCCOY: Over here. Over here.#
MCCOY: As a matter of fact, I do, but this is not one of them. Look at this.  I saw what I saw, or maybe I hallucinated it, but I want you to take a look and tell me what you think about it.#
MCCOY: Negative. He was examining the flora at the time.#
MCCOY: Collecting specimens.#
MCCOY: You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim?#
MCCOY: Well, no.#
MCCOY: Absolutely. No birds, no mammals, no insects, nothing. I'm certain our readings weren't off.#
MCCOY: Well, it could have been worse.#
MCCOY: You could have seen the rabbit.#
MCCOY: Well, yeah, I'm beginning to feel a little bit picked on, if that's what you mean.#
MCCOY: And you being the very serious young#
MCCOY: A girl's footprints. The young blonde girl I saw chasing it.#
MCCOY: Good. I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim. (They split up, and then suddenly there's a young man leaning against a tree trunk)#
MCCOY: What was it?#
MCCOY: Sounds like Don Juan.#
MCCOY: Feeling better?#
MCCOY: It's a beautiful place. A little strange, I'll admit.#
MCCOY: I see what you mean, but then you'd have whole armies of Don Juans to fight off. And me, too.#
MCCOY: You are all of those things and many more. They'll look even lovelier with you wearing them.#
MCCOY: Now, look, I don't know how or why, but the dress is here. I'd like to see you in it. Why don't you put it on?#
MCCOY: My dear girl, I am a doctor. When I peek, it's in the line of duty.#
MCCOY: McCoy here. I can't read you very well. Is this Rodriguez?#
MCCOY: Right. What the devil's wrong with communications? Esteban. Esteban. (But Esteban and Teller have problems of their own - a tiger has them trapped)#
MCCOY: This is where the Captain said to rendezvous. (makes Tonia stand with her back to a tree) I swear I heard someone moving around.#
MCCOY: A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to protect her.#
MCCOY: These things cannot be real. Hallucinations can't harm us. Go back to where you were. (Kirk and Spock arrive on the scene. The knight lowers his lance, charges, and runs McCoy through. Tonia screams. Spock draws his phaser, and Kirk the gun he confiscated from Sulu. He shoots the knight from his horse, then they run to McCoy.)#
MCCOY: Possibly because no one has died, Jim. (Strolls in with a lovely girl on each arm) I was taken below the surface for some rather remarkable repairs. It's amazing. They've got a factory complex down there you wouldn't believe. They can build or do anything immediately.#
MCCOY: Oh. Them. Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I know on Rigel Two, and, er, there were these two girls in the chorus line. And well, here they are. Well after all, I am on shore leave.#
MCCOY: Oh, yes. So you are. Well, girls, I suppose you can turn something up.#
MCCOY: It's what the doctor ordered, Jim.#
MCCOY: Indeed we did, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Void, star desert. The word conjures up pictures of dunes, oases, mirages.#
MCCOY: That doesn't surprise me, Mister Spock. I can't imagine a mirage ever disturbing those mathematically perfect brain waves of yours.#
MCCOY: I second DeSalle's request. What are we waiting for?#
MCCOY: One thing is certain. Obviously there's life on that planet.#
MCCOY: Where are your storms, Jaeger?#
MCCOY:  No response.#
MCCOY: In the name of heaven, where are we? (They head down steps into the room, past the Salt Monster in an alcove)#
MCCOY: There's no reading. They're like waxworks figures. (The main door slams shut, and there's a man in an embroidered coat playing the harpsichord)#
MCCOY: You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu. We've been looking for you for four hours.#
MCCOY: Better say, what is he? I monitored him, and what I found was unbelievable.#
MCCOY: Not in the way we define life. No trace. Zero.#
MCCOY: It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead.#
MCCOY: Captain, receiving a transporter signal.#
MCCOY: Which means Trelane is not a life form as we know it, or he'd be beaming through now.#
MCCOY: I'm quaking, but I don't know if it's from laughter or terror.#
MCCOY: Well, it was a. Oh, forget it.#
MCCOY: You should taste his food. Straw would taste better than his meat, and water a hundred times better than his brandy. Nothing has any taste at all.#
MCCOY: There's that magic word again. Does your logic find this fascinating, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: Captain, you're not beaming down.#
MCCOY: I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to Cestus Three.#
MCCOY: How well we both know that.#
MCCOY: Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality? I, for one, could use a good non-reconstituted meal.#
MCCOY: You bet your pointed ears I am. Ready whenever you are, Captain.#
MCCOY: Captain, over there.#
MCCOY: Careful, careful. Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for certain. He's in a bad way, Captain.#
MCCOY: He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent care.#
MCCOY: What are you going to do, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: What about the Captain?#
MCCOY: Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic. What about some logic now? Where's the Captain, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: The ship, our engines, our weapons. It's just inconceivable that we are immobilised.#
MCCOY: We appeal to you in the name of civilisation. Put a stop to this.#
MCCOY: If there were only some way we could contact him.#
MCCOY: So?#
MCCOY: Can that be true? Was Cestus Three an intrusion on their space?#
MCCOY: Then we could be in the wrong.#
MCCOY: The Gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves.#
MCCOY: What is it, Spock? SPOCK; An invention, Doctor. First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal. (Kirk is at the outcrop of sharp diamonds, and putting them into the bamboo too.) MCCOY: What's he doing? SPOCK; Diamonds. The hardest known substance. Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles. MCCOY: What force?#
MCCOY: Can he do it?#
MCCOY: I don't know, Jim. Maybe I'm imagining things, and maybe I'm not. You tell me.#
MCCOY: Well, as you know, we both brought Lazarus in here and I treated a deep abrasion on his forehead, right?#
MCCOY: Then I bandaged it, I stepped into this room for just a moment#
MCCOY: Well, say he's got the constitution of a dinosaur, recuperative powers ditto. As we both know, I'm a bright young medic with a miraculous touch. Why then, when I returned, there wasn't a trace of that wound on his forehead. Not even a bruise. It was like he had never been injured.#
MCCOY: I don't know, Jim. This is a big ship. I'm just a country doctor.#
MCCOY: This is no joke, Jim. I know what I saw.#
MCCOY: He's coming out of it now.#
MCCOY: It's all right. You're on board the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: How's your head?#
MCCOY: Not now, Jim.#
MCCOY: He's got to get some rest, Jim. And would you get that muscleman out of my Sickbay.#
MCCOY: He's in a lot of pain.#
MCCOY: Well, don't worry, he's not going anywhere. Not this time. (But once the medical bay is empty, Lazarus gets out of bed and has a quick seizure.)#
MCCOY: Well, Jim, with the exception of a slight bruise or two, our Captain is as healthy as a proverbial horse. He'll be coming out of it in a minute or two.#
MCCOY: Jim, what if we can't go back? What do we do, sit up here and wait for our supplies to run out, our power to die? It has to eventually, you know. We certainly can't go back to Earth. It would be worse than the Captain being returned. There are four hundred and thirty of us, and that means four hundred and thirty chances of altering the future.#
MCCOY: I'm glad to hear it.#
MCCOY: Maybe he could be retrained, reeducated.#
MCCOY: If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave.#
MCCOY: It's just a joke, Captain.#
MCCOY: Oh? This could be an historic occasion.#
MCCOY: You mean yet.#
MCCOY: How long have they been down there now?#
MCCOY: Well, shouldn't they be coming up?#
MCCOY: Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: It's been too long. Jim should have at least signaled by now.#
MCCOY: Only one signal. What happened?#
MCCOY: Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock. What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one.#
MCCOY: If something went wrong#
MCCOY: Excuse me.#
MCCOY: She's asleep.#
MCCOY: Captain.#
MCCOY: Put him over there.#
MCCOY: He'll be coming around soon, Captain.#
MCCOY: Give me a decision, Captain. He's coming out of it.#
MCCOY: Hello, friend. We were told to wait here.#
MCCOY: Can I help you, friend?#
MCCOY: We all know one another and Landru.#
MCCOY: You speak very strangely, friend. Are you from away?#
MCCOY: Ask Landru. He remembers. He knows and he watches. You are strange. Are you not of the Body?#
MCCOY: He goes to joy, peace, and tranquillity. He goes to meet Landru. Happiness is to all of us, blessed by Landru.#
MCCOY: You speak in strange whispers. This is not the way of Landru.#
MCCOY: And peace and harmony. Are you of the Body?#
MCCOY: Blessed be the Body, and health to all of its parts.#
MCCOY: Joy to you all, friends.#
MCCOY: You're not of the Body!#
MCCOY: You're not!#
MCCOY: Lawgivers! Peace. MCCOY: Lawgivers!  Traitor! Traitors! Traitors!#
MCCOY: Traitors!#
MCCOY: I tell you, we should have heard something by now.#
MCCOY: We can't just sit here.#
MCCOY: Me? I'm a doctor. If I were an officer of the line, I'd#
MCCOY: Of course not.#
MCCOY: I don't know.#
MCCOY: Well, I guess that answers our questions, Mister Scott. They're not very friendly, are they?#
MCCOY: We get them out.#
MCCOY: Not too big for the Enterprise to handle if it has to.#
MCCOY: They're holding our Captain.#
MCCOY: Mister Fox, they faked a message from the Captain, they've launched an attack against our ship. Now you want us to trust them openly?#
MCCOY: Well, Scotty, now you've done it.#
MCCOY: But you didn't know that it would work.#
MCCOY: We're continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there. Very faint, very slow. Seems to be coming from about sixty or seventy bodies, as near as I can tell.#
MCCOY: Could be. There's no sign of breathing or other form of respiration.#
MCCOY: The Eugenics Wars.#
MCCOY: Now, wait a minute. Not our attempt, Mister Spock. A group of ambitious scientists. I'm sure you know the type. Devoted to logic, completely unemotional#
MCCOY: Well, if you're actually giving me a choice#
MCCOY: No. I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget.#
MCCOY: It's theoretically possible. I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period.#
MCCOY: Jim, I have a new reading. The lights must have triggered some mechanism.#
MCCOY: We've triggered something, all right. His heart beat's increasing. Now passing eight beats per minute. There are some signs of respiration beginning.#
MCCOY: Heart beat now approaching forty per minute. The respiration pattern is firming up.#
MCCOY: Heart beat now fifty two and increasing.#
MCCOY: Maybe. Heart beat dropping.#
MCCOY: Heartbeat now thirty, dropping fast. It's a heart flutter. He's dying.#
MCCOY: He'll die in seconds if we don't. (Kirk uses something metal in his hand to break the glass and open the compartment. The man is slid out on a trolley, gasping and awake. He tries to speak.)#
MCCOY:  That'll be all.#
MCCOY: He'll live.#
MCCOY: No, I'm good, but not that good. There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death. Look at that. Even as he is now, his heart valve action has twice the power of yours and mine. Lung efficiency is fifty percent better.#
MCCOY: I'd estimate he could lift us both with one arm. It will be interesting to see if his brain matches his body.#
MCCOY: It appears he will, Lieutenant.#
MCCOY: A pity you wasted your life on command, Jim. You'd have made a fair psychologist.#
MCCOY: Sickbay to lab. Anything new on those bios?#
MCCOY: Good. McCoy out. (Khan sees a display of old medical instruments on the wall, takes a scalpel, and is back in bed when McCoy walks in to check on him. As the good doctor leans over, Khan grabs him by the throat and holds the blade to his neck.) MCCOY: Well, either choke me or cut my throat. Make up your mind.#
MCCOY: You're in  You're in bed, holding a knife at your doctor's throat.#
MCCOY: It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery, just under the left ear.#
MCCOY: I was simply trying to avoid an argument. You're aboard the United Spaceship Enterprise. Your vessel is in tow.#
MCCOY: That is correct.#
MCCOY: I have a patient here with many questions, Captain.#
MCCOY: Jim. A little later might be better.#
MCCOY: Very impressive. Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner?#
MCCOY: Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim.#
MCCOY: Well, he has a magnetism. Almost electric. You felt it. And it could over power McGivers with her preoccupation with the past.#
MCCOY: The last of the tyrants to be overthrown.#
MCCOY: No wars until he was attacked.#
MCCOY: To be conquered by you. A starship would make that most simple, wouldn't it?#
MCCOY: Jim. Agreed you have the authority#
MCCOY: On pure speculation, just an educated guess, I'd say that man is alive.#
MCCOY: You shook hands with him, Jim. His flesh was warm. He's alive. There's no doubt about that.#
MCCOY: That'll be all. Thank you very much.#
MCCOY: I've examined nine men so far, varying in ages from twenty three to fifty nine. They're all in perfect condition. Text book responses. Heart, lungs, excellent. Co-ordination, excellent. Reflexes, excellent. If there are many more of them, I could throw away my shingle.#
MCCOY: No animals. That's peculiar.#
MCCOY: I'd like to see the medical records on the expedition.#
MCCOY: I'm afraid I'll have to bow out. I have to continue with these medical examinations. However, if I find everyone else's health to be as perfect as yours, I#
MCCOY: This is McCoy, Jim. I think you'd better get back here.#
MCCOY: No, but I'd like you to see this for yourself.#
MCCOY: Sandoval's medical record, four years ago when the expedition left Earth. He registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child. No major operations, but there was an appendectomy. Received all required inoculations, et cetera.#
MCCOY: Nothing, but I examined that man no more than two hours ago. You know what his readings were? Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Just like everyone else I've examined here.#
MCCOY: No. I thought of that and tested it on myself. It accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once. It did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed.#
MCCOY: We've explained the Berthold rays to you and their effect. Can't you understand?#
MCCOY: Would you like to use a butterfly net on him, Captain?#
MCCOY: DeSalle said he was going to examine some native plants he found. Did Spock call in at all?#
MCCOY: That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim.#
MCCOY: I didn't say that.#
MCCOY: Not exactly. He might be in trouble.#
MCCOY: How will you find Spock?#
MCCOY: What are you doing with those things, DeSalle?#
MCCOY:  Ready to beam up. Hiya, Jimmy boy! Hey, I've taken care of everything. All y'all gotta do is relax. Doctor's orders.#
MCCOY: Oh, must be nigh onto a hundred by now.#
MCCOY: I'm not interested in any physical-psychological aspects, Jim boy. We all perfectly healthy down here.#
MCCOY: Sho'nuf. Hey, Jim boy, y'all ever have a real cold Georgia-style mint julep, huh?#
MCCOY: Who wants to counteract paradise, Jim boy?#
MCCOY: Well now, it's a little early to be counting stars, Miss Leila.#
MCCOY: Well, now, I think I can fix that for you. Enterprise?#
MCCOY: What do you mean, what sort of work? I'm a doctor.#
MCCOY: Oh, no? Would you like to see how fast I can put you in a hospital?#
MCCOY: Just a minute. You'd better make me a mechanic. Then I can treat little tin gods like you.  Sorry, Sandoval. I don't know what made me do that.#
MCCOY: You can't stay here. You can't survive without the spores. After you've cleared at the Starbase, you could be relocated. It depends upon what you want.#
MCCOY: Enterprise.#
MCCOY: This is McCoy. Sandoval would like to talk to the Captain.#
MCCOY: Well, Jim, I've just examined the last of the colonists, and they're all in absolutely perfect, perfect health. A fringe benefit left over by the spores.#
MCCOY: Well, that's the second time man's been thrown out of paradise.#
MCCOY: I'd like to examine the body.#
MCCOY: Schmitter didn't burn to death, not in the usual sense, anyway.#
MCCOY: Well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the plant's physician agrees with me. A chemical corrosion. Almost as if he'd been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid.#
MCCOY: Strong enough to eat anything else that you can think of.#
MCCOY: You're creating fantasies, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in an oxygen atmosphere.#
MCCOY: I still think you're imagining things.#
MCCOY: What in the name of? What is Spock doing?#
MCCOY: Help that?#
MCCOY: You can't be serious. That thing is virtually made out of stone!#
MCCOY: I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer.#
MCCOY:  That's right, Lieutenant. Just beam it down to me immediately, and never mind what I want it for. I just want it! Now move!#
MCCOY: I'll let you know.#
MCCOY: It won't die. By golly, Jim, I'm beginning to think I can cure a rainy day.#
MCCOY: Help it? I cured it.#
MCCOY: Well, I had the ship beam down a hundred pounds of that thermoconcrete. You know, the kind we use to build emergency shelters out of. It's mostly silicone. So I just trowelled it into the wound, and it'll act like a bandage until it heals. Take a look. It's as good as new.#
MCCOY: Oh, she did, did she? Now tell me, did she happen to make any comment about those ears?#
MCCOY: Some heart flutter. Better risk a few drops of cordrazine.#
MCCOY: You were about to make a medical comment, Jim?#
MCCOY:  Killers! Assassins! I won't let you! I'll kill you first! I won't let you! You won't get me! Murderers! Killers!#
MCCOY: Killers! Killers! I won't let you get me! I'll kill you first! I won't let you get me! Assassins! Murderers! Killers! (Scott and a guard manage to grab McCoy, and Spock neck-pinches him. An army of lancers charge across the doughnut.)#
MCCOY: Assassins! Murderers! Murderers! Assassins! You! What planet is this?  No! Don't run! I won't kill you! It's they who do the killing! Don't run! I won't kill you!#
MCCOY: I'm glad you got away, too. Why do you think they want to kill us?#
MCCOY: Where? Where are we? Earth? The constellations seem right, but. Explain! Explain this trick.#
MCCOY: Biped. Small. Good cranial development. No doubt considerable human ancestry. Is that how you're able to fake all of this? Very good. Modern museum perfection. Right down to the cement beams. Very, very good. Oh, I'd give a lot to see the hospital. Probably needles and sutures. All the pain. They used to hand-cut and sew people like garments. Needles and sutures. Oh, the terrible pain! (He passes out on the ground and his colour starts to improve. The man frisks him, finds his phaser and runs off a little way. Then he fiddles with the phaser, and disintegrates himself.)#
MCCOY: Oh, Miss. That coffee, it just smells wonderful.#
MCCOY: I can't. I got to keep moving. I can't let them find me.#
MCCOY: The most common question to ask would be, where am I? I don't think I'll ask it.#
MCCOY: The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm either unconscious or demented. This looks like old Earth around 1920 or 25.#
MCCOY: I am unconscious, or demented.#
MCCOY: I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist. I am Leonard McCoy, Senior Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise.#
MCCOY: It's quite all right. It's quite all right dear, because I don't believe in you, either.#
MCCOY: Come in.#
MCCOY: Thank you.#
MCCOY: No, not particularly. You know, I've convinced myself that this is all in a cordrazine hallucination, but I've decided you're not.#
MCCOY: But if you're not, what are you?#
MCCOY: I don't doubt it. What about this place? Do you run it?#
MCCOY: Why?#
MCCOY: Well, it was for me, at least. You may have saved my life.#
MCCOY: Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from. Allow me to show my gratitude. Perhaps there's something I can do around here to thank you.#
MCCOY: A who movie?#
MCCOY: Well, I know what a movie is, but.#
MCCOY: You deliberately stopped me, Jim. I could have saved her. Do you know what you just did?#
MCCOY: There's no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets. Jim.#
MCCOY: There's one possibility. The mass insanity may have reached this planet, too.#
MCCOY: Jim, your brother Sam and his family, aren't they stationed on this planet? Captain's log stardate 3287.2. The mass insanity we have tracked across this section of the galaxy seems to have already touched Deneva. That planet, colonised over a century ago, is one of the most beautiful in the galaxy.#
MCCOY: Jim, did you know who that woman was?#
MCCOY: There's something wrong, Jim. Their nervous systems. Unconscious like this, there should be just routine autonomic activity, but I'm getting a very high reading, as though even in their unconscious state, they're being violently stimulated.#
MCCOY: Is this your brother, Jim?#
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Jim. The boy's unconscious, but he's still alive.#
MCCOY: I'd better get the boy and his mother back to the ship. I can't do much for them down here.#
MCCOY: McCoy to Enterprise. Prepare to beam up party of four.#
MCCOY: Ready to beam up, Captain. I'd like you to be onboard when your sister-in-law regains consciousness.#
MCCOY: I won't be able to give you the exact cause until I get the plates back from the lab. They're both in extreme pain. I sedated them heavily. But your sister-in-law seems to have a high tolerance. The tranquilliser hasn't affected her much.#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: When she answers questions, any questions, it's as if she's fighting to get the answers out. As though something is exerting pain to stop her.#
MCCOY: I'll do everything I can, Jim, to save him.#
MCCOY: Nurse. That's the second time he's come out of it. Either he's fighting us, or something inside of him is fighting us.#
MCCOY: Let's prepare to close. Nurse!#
MCCOY: Miss Chapel.#
MCCOY: Miss Chapel, if you cannot assist me as required, call another nurse in here. But do one or the other now.#
MCCOY: To be very frank, Jim, I don't know that I can do anything for Spock or your nephew.  They're pieces of some form of living tissue. I removed one from Spock's spinal cord, the other from your sister-in-law's body. They're both the same. The boy's too weak to touch. Besides, removal of the tissue wouldn't stop the pain anyhow as far as I can tell.#
MCCOY: No. I just removed these for examination. His body's full of these tentacles, entwining and growing all about his nervous system.#
MCCOY: The same. Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a stinger much like a bee or wasp, leaving one of these in the victim's body. It takes over the victim very rapidly, and the entwining is far, far too involved for conventional surgery to remove.#
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Jim. The lab, the science departments, we're all stumped.#
MCCOY: The K3 indicator registers the level of pain. Watch as I turn it on. That's what he's been going through. I've never seen anything like it. No wonder the poor devils go mad.#
MCCOY: Who knows, Jim? I know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him, but whether he can control it hour to hour#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: Jim, aren't you forgetting something? There are over a million colonists on that planet down there, just as much your responsibility. They need your help, too.#
MCCOY: Jim, this is ridiculous. I don't want my patients running around. He should be in bed.#
MCCOY: Jim, that man is sick. Don't give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job.#
MCCOY: You may be controlling the pain, Mister Spock, but you're far from all right.#
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Captain. I've tried everything I can. Variant radiation, intense heat, even as great as nine thousand degrees.#
MCCOY: Which happens to be my point. The thing won't die, even at temperatures and radiation which would burn Spock and your nephew to ashes.#
MCCOY: Captain, I understand your concern. Your affection for Spock, the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brother's family.#
MCCOY: Gentlemen, I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of destroying over a million people.#
MCCOY: If killing five people saves ten, it's a bargain. Is that your simple logic, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Jim. We've been over and over it, made every conceivable test.#
MCCOY: Jim, we've been through it and through it. Radiation, heat#
MCCOY: Nothing lethal about light.#
MCCOY: You can't move Deneva closer to the sun, Jim.#
MCCOY: Well, I can rig a test cubicle in the bio-lab, put our specimen in it. But I don't#
MCCOY: Put on your masks. (They cover their eyes with goggles while the light is shone in the chamber.) MCCOY: Completed.#
MCCOY: It worked! We can do it. What's the matter, Jim? We can do it.#
MCCOY: Well, I don't know. Maybe trial#
MCCOY: But I'd have to put a#
MCCOY: Do you have any idea of the risk?#
MCCOY: Do you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerves?#
MCCOY: All right. I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles.#
MCCOY: Unfortunately, you're both right. It's the only thing we can do. All right, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Mister Spock's the best first officer in the fleet.#
MCCOY: Completed.#
MCCOY:  Oh, no.#
MCCOY: I threw the total spectrum of light at the creature. It wasn't necessary. I didn't stop to think that only one kind of light might've killed it.#
MCCOY: I didn't need to throw the blinding white light at all, Jim. Spock, I#
MCCOY: McCoy here.#
MCCOY: Yes, Captain. He'll be happy to hear that.#
MCCOY: The blindness was temporary, Jim. There's something about his optical nerves which aren't the same as a human's.#
MCCOY: 'Tis a pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Unusual eye arrangement. I might've known he'd turn up with something like that.#
MCCOY: I said, please don't tell Spock I said he was the best first officer in the fleet.#
MCCOY: What's on, Jim?#
MCCOY: The man is dead.#
MCCOY: Scott and Sulu?#
MCCOY: Whatever this stuff is, it's getting thicker. Suppose that has anything to do with the interference?#
MCCOY: Listen. Now, what do you think that#
MCCOY: That was a pretty real illusion, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: Is this how we lost contact with the first landing party?#
MCCOY: Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it? KIRK; Would it? I wonder.#
MCCOY: Three witches, what appears to be a castle and a black cat.#
MCCOY: Dust, cobwebs. Halloween is right. (The black cat is ahead of them when the stone floor gives way and dumps the trio into )#
MCCOY: You were saying something about trick or treat.#
MCCOY: Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort?#
MCCOY: They appear to be drugged, Jim. Look at their eyes. Hardly blink at all.#
MCCOY: They're going to release us. (Sulu undoes their shackles and they start to leave. They begin to fight, but suddenly)#
MCCOY: That cat.#
MCCOY: Familiars?#
MCCOY: He doesn't know about trick or treat.#
MCCOY: We're not hungry.#
MCCOY: These look real.#
MCCOY: Tests?#
MCCOY: You kept Scott and Sulu as catspaws to lure us down here. How'd you know we'd come?#
MCCOY: What happened, Jim?#
MCCOY: Too late. All of this, just an illusion.#
MCCOY:  Jim.#
MCCOY: No change.#
MCCOY: Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet.#
MCCOY: Sakuro's disease is extremely rare. The chances of anyone contracting it are literally billions to one.#
MCCOY: Jim, we've got to get Miss Hedford to the Enterprise. Her condition.#
MCCOY: Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. Some krypton, argon, neon. Temperature seventy five degrees Fahrenheit. Practically identical to Earth atmosphere.#
MCCOY: Jim, I just took a tricording sweep, and I got the same readings almost as Spock got when we were pulled off course.#
MCCOY: I think so, only it reads here on the surface with us. It's in that direction, and it doesn't read solid. It's more unstable, tenuous, like a collection of gases.#
MCCOY: Pleasure.#
MCCOY: He's human, Jim. Everything checks out perfectly.#
MCCOY: Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much.#
MCCOY: What's that?#
MCCOY: Familiar? Now that you mention it, he does.#
MCCOY: No temperature yet, but we've got to get under way soon, Jim. I guarantee you, it will develop. What are we going to do?#
MCCOY: Do you feel hot?#
MCCOY: It was quite a hike here. You're tired. Just take it easy for a while.#
MCCOY: Temperature, Captain. First sign.#
MCCOY: That's a pretty far out story.#
MCCOY: But that's impossible. Zefram Cochrane died a hundred and fifty years ago.#
MCCOY: How do you feel?#
MCCOY: You're running a little temperature. Perhaps you should lie down.#
MCCOY: All right. Try to relax. Jim, it's started, the fever. It's over a hundred, and it's climbing.#
MCCOY: A matter of hours, that's all.#
MCCOY: Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining.#
MCCOY: Are you all right?#
MCCOY: Spock! Are you all right?#
MCCOY: It attacked you?#
MCCOY: Oh, yes. I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mister Spock, but am I correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity can be shorted out?#
MCCOY: We understand how you feel, Mister Cochrane, but it has to be done.#
MCCOY: Stop it! You're killing them! Stop it, please! Stop it! You're choking them! Let them go. You're choking them! Stop it! (Outside, Cochrane hears McCoy's shouts, and somehow calms the Companion. It vanishes.) MCCOY: You all right, Jim?#
MCCOY: Spock?#
MCCOY: What kind of talk is that?#
MCCOY: It isn't your fault.#
MCCOY: Maybe you're a soldier so often that you forget you're also trained to be a diplomat. Why not try a carrot instead of a stick?#
MCCOY: Yes, for the worse. Ship's Log. Stardate 3219.8. Lieutenant Commander Scott recording in the absence of Captain Kirk. A shuttlecraft bearing the Captain, the first officer, Chief Surgeon McCoy, and Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford is now definitely overdue for a rendezvous with the Enterprise. We are attempting to backtrack it.#
MCCOY: You don't? A blind man could see it with a cane. You're not a pet. You're not a specimen kept in a cage. You're a lover.#
MCCOY: There's nothing disgusting about it. It's just another life form, that's all. You get used to those things.#
MCCOY: Right here, Miss Hedford.#
MCCOY: You just rest.#
MCCOY: What did you hope to gain by that, Jim?#
MCCOY: I don't understand it. She's not sick at all.#
MCCOY: She's perfectly healthy. Heart like a hammer, respiration normal, blood pressure normal. This is medically impossible.#
MCCOY: Jim, what about that war on Epsilon Canaris Three?#
MCCOY: They're quite large. Seven feet tall is not unusual. They're extremely fast and strong. Lieutenant? Make no mistake. They can be highly dangerous. The Capellans' basic weapon, the kligat. At any distance up to a hundred yards, they can make it almost as effective against a man as a phaser. (On the monitor, we see McCoy being given a demonstration in which a small sapling is cut in half by one of these hand-thrown objects.) MCCOY: In addition, an assortment of swords and knives.#
MCCOY: Only a few months. We found them totally uninterested in medical aid or hospitals. They believe only the strong should survive.#
MCCOY: Agreed. Once they've got it into their heads we're showing force, you can forget them signing any mining treaty.#
MCCOY: We come with open hearts and hands.#
MCCOY: Don't move a muscle. Captain's log, stardate 3497.2. Planet Capella Four. The rare mineral topaline, vital to the life-support systems of planetoid colonies, has been discovered in abundance here. Our mission, obtain a mining agreement. But we've discovered a Klingon agent has preceded us to the planet. A discovery which has cost the life of one of my crewmen.#
MCCOY: Jim!#
MCCOY: Does Maab know that the Klingons are our sworn enemies by their own words?#
MCCOY: Yes, I mentioned that.#
MCCOY: Because he was drawing a weapon on another of their guests.#
MCCOY: Look, Jim. I know what it means to you to lose a crewman.#
MCCOY: Yes, Captain?#
MCCOY: I understand.#
MCCOY: You've shown friendship by handing over our weapons. She's making a gesture in return.#
MCCOY: Jim! You touch it, her nearest male relative will have to try to kill you. They're offering you a chance for combat. They consider it more pleasurable than love.#
MCCOY: Let me take this, Jim. What Maab has said is true. Our customs are different. What the Klingon has said is unimportant, and we do not hear his words. I just called the Klingon a liar.#
MCCOY: Captain, careful.#
MCCOY: Captain, I'm going to fix that woman's arm. They can only kill me once for touching her.#
MCCOY: Let me see that arm.#
MCCOY: Now listen, you may be a Capellan woman and the widow of a high teer, but I'm a doctor, and it's my tradition to care for the sick and injured. Now, let me see that arm. (She does, and he treats the burn. Meanwhile, Kirk spots the posse coming after them.)#
MCCOY: You listen to me, young woman. I'll touch you in any way or manner that my professional judgment indicates.#
MCCOY: Just as I thought. It can come anytime now.#
MCCOY: Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know.#
MCCOY: Capellans aren't human, Jim. They're humanoid. There's certain internal differences. I don't have equipment to handle an emergency.#
MCCOY: Forget it. I can do it. The last thing I want around is a ham-handed ship's captain. (They continue their climb up the canyon. It is steep and Eleen is struggling. Kirk goes to help.)#
MCCOY: I'll need help getting her in there.#
MCCOY: Look, I'm a doctor, not an escalator! Spock, give me a hand!#
MCCOY: Just a minute. Let me get her on the rock. There you go. (Kirk puts the tablet on a rock and hits it with his knife. It bursts into flame and the whole cave is illuminated. Eleen is in pain.)#
MCCOY: No a right cross.#
MCCOY: It's in mine from now on.#
MCCOY: Easy, easy. I'm here. Now you must want the child!#
MCCOY: So they take all the credit here. Poppycock! Answer me. Do you want my help? Answer me. Do you want my help?  All right. Say to yourself, The child is mine. The child is mine. It is mine!#
MCCOY: No, no. You've got it all wrong.#
MCCOY: No. Say to yourself, The child is mine. It is mine. It is#
MCCOY: No, no, Mister Spock. You place this arm under here to support its back, and this hand here to support its head.#
MCCOY: I'll explain later.#
MCCOY: Jim! Spock! Jim! Spock!#
MCCOY: My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone.#
MCCOY: It's all right. It's in there. I guess I'll forget psychiatry, stick with surgery. I really thought she'd learned to want it.#
MCCOY: I'll go with you.#
MCCOY: No, that's not the way to handle it. Here, like this. Here, take his little head like that. There, arm in a. That's it. See how easy? Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.#
MCCOY: Representing the high teer, Leonard James Akaar.#
MCCOY: Has a kind of a ring to it, don't you think, James?#
MCCOY: Lieutenant, you look a bit tired this morning.#
MCCOY: Even from here I can tell his pulse rate's up.#
MCCOY: I'm not sure I like that, Jim.#
MCCOY: And he thinks he's the right man for her, but I'm not sure she thinks he's the right man. On the other hand, she's a woman. All woman. One day she'll find the right man and off she'll go, out of the service.#
MCCOY: What in the name of? (Where there was originally an image of a nice blue and white planet there is now a .... hand?)#
MCCOY: Sickbay reports five minor injuries, all being treated.#
MCCOY: Sure it's wise, Jim?#
MCCOY: Well, you're the A and A officer, aren't you? Archaeology, anthropology, ancient civilisations.#
MCCOY: We're going to need help in all those areas.#
MCCOY: Simple humanoid, Captain.#
MCCOY: To coin a phrase, fascinating.#
MCCOY: I can't say much till I check our these readings. He looks human, but of course that doesn't mean a thing.#
MCCOY: Yes?#
MCCOY: You have a theory?#
MCCOY: What?#
MCCOY: May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship?#
MCCOY: Stunned but coming around. I'm not sure it's wise to let her go off like that.#
MCCOY: You saw how capricious he is. Benevolent one minute, angry the next. One more wrong move from her and he could kill her.#
MCCOY: Scotty doesn't believe in gods.#
MCCOY: Yes. To the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early Greece, creatures like that would have been gods.#
MCCOY: Not the whole encyclopaedia, Chekov.#
MCCOY: Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim.#
MCCOY: Number one on our list of things to do.#
MCCOY: Yes, except my estimation for his physical condition. In spite of Apollo's bag of tricks, he comes up essentially normal with just a few variations. However, there's an extra organ in his chest that I can't even make a guess about.#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: Not good. Severe shock.#
MCCOY: Chekov, give me a hand.#
MCCOY: How do you feel?#
MCCOY: Some neural damage.#
MCCOY: Makes sense.#
MCCOY: The trouble with overworking him is that it can get us killed.#
MCCOY: I still say it can get us killed.#
MCCOY: Kill a deer. That's the funniest thing I ever heard.#
MCCOY: Any more good ideas, Jim?#
MCCOY: Well, it doesn't serve any other purpose I know of.#
MCCOY: What the devil is that?#
MCCOY: I wish we hadn't had to do this.#
MCCOY: Oh, Captain. Got a minute?#
MCCOY: It's Spock. Have you noticed anything strange about him?#
MCCOY: Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint without an examination, but he's become increasingly restive. If he were not a Vulcan, I'd almost say nervous. And for another thing, he's avoiding food. I checked and he hasn't eaten at all in three days.#
MCCOY: Miss Chapel.#
MCCOY: Captain.#
MCCOY: What's this?#
MCCOY: Oh! Vulcan plomeek soup, and I'll bet you made it too. You never give up hoping, do you?#
MCCOY: It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel. (She turns and rings the bell on Spock's quarters. The door opens and she enters.)#
MCCOY: Jim, when I suggested to Spock that it was time for his routine check-up, your logical, unemotional first officer turned to me and said, you will cease to pry into my personal matters, Doctor, or I shall certainly break your neck.#
MCCOY: Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you.#
MCCOY: My orders were to give you a thorough physical. In case you hadn't noticed, I have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do. Come on, Spock. Yield to the logic of the situation.#
MCCOY: Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan.#
MCCOY: No! Now. Right away. If you don't get him to Vulcan within a week eight days at the outside, he'll die. He'll die, Jim.#
MCCOY: I don't know.#
MCCOY: There's a growing imbalance of body functions, as if in our bodies huge amounts of adrenalin were constantly being pumped into our bloodstreams. Now, I can't trace it down in my biocomps. Spock won't tell me what it is. But if it isn't stopped somehow, the physical and emotional pressures will simply kill him.#
MCCOY: He does, and he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran Shellmouth. No use to ask him, Jim. He won't talk.#
MCCOY: Well, that's that.#
MCCOY: You can't go off to Vulcan against Starfleet orders. You'll be busted#
MCCOY: I shall be honoured, sir.#
MCCOY: He called it Koon-ut what?#
MCCOY: They still go mad at this time. Perhaps it's the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time.#
MCCOY: Yeah. Hot as Vulcan. Now I understand what that phrase means.#
MCCOY: I wonder when his T'Pring arrives.#
MCCOY: T'Pau. Officiating at Spock's wedding?#
MCCOY: Leonard McCoy, ma'am.#
MCCOY:  With him?#
MCCOY: Ma'am, I don't understand. Are you trying to say that she rejected him? That she doesn't want him?#
MCCOY: I doubt it. Not in his present condition.#
MCCOY: You can't do it, Jim.#
MCCOY: No. She said their laws and customs were not binding on you.#
MCCOY: In this climate? If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will. You can't do it!#
MCCOY: Jim, listen, if you#
MCCOY: These men are friends. To force them to fight until one of them is killed#
MCCOY: Spock! No!#
MCCOY: Is this Vulcan chivalry? The air's too hot and thin for Kirk. He's not used to it.#
MCCOY:  I can compensate for the atmosphere and the temperature with this. At least it'll give Kirk a fighting chance.#
MCCOY: You're going to have to kill him, Jim.#
MCCOY: It's a tri-ox compound. It'll help you breathe. Now be careful!#
MCCOY: McCoy to Enterprise.#
MCCOY: Have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party. As strange as it may seem, Mister Spock, you're in command now. Any orders?#
MCCOY: Spock, I#
MCCOY: Spock, I#
MCCOY: Nurse, would you mind, please?#
MCCOY: Spock, what happened down there? The girl? The wedding?#
MCCOY: There's just one thing, Mister Spock. You can't tell me that when you first saw Jim alive that you weren't on the verge of giving us an emotional scene that would have brought the house down. .#
MCCOY: Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical.#
MCCOY: In a pig's eye!#
MCCOY: Commodore? Commodore Decker?#
MCCOY: Jim, give him a minute. He's in a state of shock.#
MCCOY: This whole thing's incredible. A robot? A machine like that, who would build it?#
MCCOY: But why?#
MCCOY: No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.#
MCCOY: The first thing we're going to do is get you back to the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: Come on.#
MCCOY: No casualties, Mister Spock. How are we doing?#
MCCOY: In plain, non-Vulcan English, we've been lucky.#
MCCOY: You can't let him do this, Spock.#
MCCOY: So are you, sir. Well, Spock?#
MCCOY: To blazes with regulations! You can't let him take command when you know he's wrong!#
MCCOY: I'll certify that right now.#
MCCOY: Now, you know I haven't had time to run an examination on him.#
MCCOY: What about the Captain? We can't leave#
MCCOY: Spock, do something!#
MCCOY: That's an understatement if I ever heard one. This is a completely hedonistic society.#
MCCOY: My work, Jim. This is prescription stuff. Don't forget, the explosion that threw Scotty against a bulkhead was caused by a woman.#
MCCOY: Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, considerable psychological damage could have been caused. For example, his total resentment toward women.#
MCCOY: Of course, in my professional opinion, when he gets back to the ship, he's going to hate you for making him leave Argelius. But then he will have lost total resentment toward women.#
MCCOY: Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go.#
MCCOY: She's dead, Jim.#
MCCOY: You're not a native of Argelius, sir?#
MCCOY: Jim.  If he says he can't remember, he probably doesn't. You know Scotty.#
MCCOY: You don't think by any chance that Scotty#
MCCOY: But you don't just throw him to the wolves.#
MCCOY: But he's suffering from a severe concussion.#
MCCOY: The Argelian empathic contact?#
MCCOY: Prefect, it will give us a detailed account of everything that's happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty four hours.#
MCCOY: Prefect, the psycho-tricorder will require privacy to be effective.#
MCCOY: Captain, under normal conditions, Scotty would have never done such a thing.#
MCCOY: Of course, there's another possibility.#
MCCOY: Hysterical amnesia. When a man feels guilty about something, something too terrible to remember, he blots it out of his conscious memory.#
MCCOY: She's dead, Jim. Just like the other one.#
MCCOY: Go ahead, Scotty.#
MCCOY: Is that all that happened?#
MCCOY: It could be, Jim. That head injury.#
MCCOY: Locks can be picked, Jim.#
MCCOY: Sorry, Jim. The lock may or may not have been picked. It would be hard to tell even with the tricorder.#
MCCOY: I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim. Scotty simply could not have done it.#
MCCOY: There would be no room for doubt. We would know. And after all, that's what we're after, isn't it, Prefect? To know?#
MCCOY: Captain, I don't see how that can be.#
MCCOY: That devours all life and light.#
MCCOY: Yes. Redjac, Beratis and, er, Kesla.#
MCCOY: Sybo said it feeds on death.#
MCCOY: Yes, but she said more than that. Not just death, but fear. She said it also feeds on fear.#
MCCOY: Extremely possible There are many such examples that exist in nature.#
MCCOY: Just after you left Jaris' house, we discovered the murder knife was missing.#
MCCOY: He's dead, Jim.#
MCCOY: Scotty, give me a hand. (They prop Hengist up on a chair, leaning against the table.)#
MCCOY: I've got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano.#
MCCOY: If you drive it out of the computers, it'll have to go somewhere else.#
MCCOY: I'm almost finished. Just Jaris and me.#
MCCOY: Well, it might take up knitting, but nothing more violent than that.#
MCCOY: And you and Mister Spock, Captain.#
MCCOY: No, I don't think so. I think I ought to stay clear.#
MCCOY: You'd better be careful. You're going to hurt somebody with that thing. (Hengist pushes his hostage at McCoy then tries to attack Kirk. He's easily defeated.)#
MCCOY: Well, Jaris is all right.#
MCCOY: That thing can't die.#
MCCOY: I don't know. Five or six hours. I gave them a pretty big shot, Jim.#
MCCOY: I know the place, Jim.#
MCCOY: They've got the co-ordinates, Jim. It's locked in.#
MCCOY: What do we do now, go up and knock?#
MCCOY: Jim, I don't think anybody's in there.#
MCCOY: Well, I'm not the Kirk. Tell me what your function is.#
MCCOY: Unstable infestation? The population of four planets? What kind of function#
MCCOY: Ridiculous. Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago.#
MCCOY: Of course. Jackson Roykirk.#
MCCOY:  That's not the same.#
MCCOY: As I recall, it wasn't. It was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek new life-forms.#
MCCOY: He's dead, Jim.#
MCCOY: There's nothing I can do, Jim. If there's a chance, it'll have to be soon.#
MCCOY: Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain. We'd better give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as tracings of Scotty's hyperencephalogram.#
MCCOY: The body is in Sickbay.#
MCCOY: I could have told you that without looking.#
MCCOY: It's unbelievable.#
MCCOY: Take it easy. Lie down, Scotty. We just want to check you out.#
MCCOY: I'd like to check it out, if you don't mind. A man is not just a biological unit that you can patch together.#
MCCOY: Nurse, I want him prepared for a full physical examination.#
MCCOY: Yes. I'll get on it right away. Oh, and in spite of the way you repaired Scotty, you metal ticking#
MCCOY: That's a laugh.#
MCCOY: How's she doing?#
MCCOY: Well, she checks out with no brain damage. We've got all the educational tapes in our library. Now it's up to us.#
MCCOY: I think so. Looks like some kind of shock.#
MCCOY: Nomad examined the personnel files and the medical histories. She tried to stop him.#
MCCOY: Yours.#
MCCOY: Jim, with all the systems out we'll only have enough air and heat for#
MCCOY: I thought you might like to know that Lieutenant Uhura is back to college level. She'll be back on the job within a week.#
MCCOY: Well, I just might stake out a claim and settle down here, Jim.#
MCCOY: It's a shame to have to intrude.#
MCCOY: More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign.#
MCCOY: Dead.#
MCCOY: Jim, I don't like this.#
MCCOY: Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff. See the stuff on the end? It's like saplin, only it's a thousand times stronger.#
MCCOY: I filled him with enough masiform D to make the whole crew turn handsprings, and he's not responding. Got to get him back to the ship, Jim.#
MCCOY: If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an upset stomach.#
MCCOY: Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this.#
MCCOY: Well, there goes paradise.#
MCCOY: Incredible.#
MCCOY: I just ran a thorough check on the natives, and there's a complete lack of harmful bacteria in their systems, no decalcification, no degeneration of tissue, no arteriosclerosis. In simple terms, Jim, they're not growing old, and I can't begin to tell you how old they are, twenty years or twenty thousand years.#
MCCOY: What's going on, Jim?#
MCCOY: It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of a statement.#
MCCOY: There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment, the right to have conditions which permit growth.#
MCCOY: Jim, you're not just going to stand by and be blinded to what's going on here. These are humanoids, intelligent. They need to advance and grow. Don't you understand what my readings indicate? There's been no progress here in at least ten thousand years. This isn't life. It's stagnation.#
MCCOY: It might work for you, Mister Spock, but it doesn't work for me. Humanoids living so they can service a hunk of tin.#
MCCOY: From a machine? That I'd like to see.#
MCCOY: Second degree burns. Not serious, but I'll bet they smart.#
MCCOY: Jim#
MCCOY: Fine time to ring the dinner bell.#
MCCOY: I don't agree with you at all, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Jim, I want you to hear this.#
MCCOY: We put those people back on a normal course of social evolution. I see nothing wrong in that.#
MCCOY: Yes, sir.#
MCCOY: What is this? Everything's all messed up and changed around, out of place.#
MCCOY: No, not everything. That spot, I spilt acid there a year ago. Jim, What in blazes is this?#
MCCOY: An exchange. If we're here#
MCCOY: What about the Halkans? We can't let them be destroyed.#
MCCOY: Here. Here. What's this?#
MCCOY: And my Sickbay is a chamber of horrors. My assistants were betting on the tolerance of an injured man. How long it would take him to pass out from the pain.#
MCCOY: I'm a doctor, not an engineer.#
MCCOY: Jim, the way this ship is run, what kind of people are we in this universe?#
MCCOY: Jim, if we're here, what do you suppose our counterparts doing back in our universe?#
MCCOY: That ought to hold him for about six hours. (They go to the upper level, and Scott begins his work.#
MCCOY: Now it's up to the captain.#
MCCOY: Help me get him on the table. Well, come on. Help me get him on the table. He'll die without immediate treatment.#
MCCOY: We'll get home. This won't take long.#
MCCOY: Do you want me to stop, Jim? It'll only take a minute.#
MCCOY: I can't let him die, Jim. You get on to the transporter room. I'll be there in five minutes.#
MCCOY: I guarantee it. Now, go on, please.#
MCCOY: Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better. It gave him character. Of course almost any change would be a distinct improvement.#
MCCOY: I'm sure.#
MCCOY: Perhaps they weren't expecting us.#
MCCOY: Did he report anything wrong?#
MCCOY: Exactly what it looks like. Death by natural causes. Old age.#
MCCOY: He can hear you, Jim, but he doesn't understand. Let's let him rest.#
MCCOY: The expedition is suffering from extreme old age, and they're growing older by the minute. Much older. My examinations have turned up absolutely nothing. In fact, I don't have a clue.#
MCCOY: Lieutenant Galway.#
MCCOY: Of course. Go right ahead.#
MCCOY: It's probably nothing important.#
MCCOY: Well, don't worry about it. Perhaps a little hypersonic treatment might clear it up.#
MCCOY: The last one. Robert Johnson. Cause of death, old age.#
MCCOY: Which adds up to absolutely nothing.#
MCCOY: All you need are vitamins, but you can come up anyhow.#
MCCOY: You take over my job and see what happens to you.#
MCCOY: What's your problem, Jim?#
MCCOY: You're probably right, Doctor. By the way, I don't like how you've been running this ship lately.#
MCCOY: Jim, I think we better'd run a complete physical on you.#
MCCOY: No, Jim. It's advanced arthritis, and it's spreading.#
MCCOY: I can run it through again, but I'll come up with the same thing. ;#
MCCOY: All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of Chekov, are aging at various rates. Approximately thirty years for each day. I don't know what's causing it. A virus, a bacteria, or evil spirits, but I'm trying to find out.#
MCCOY: I'm doing what I can.  You're perfectly healthy.#
MCCOY: I did not say you weren't affected, Mister Spock. You are perfectly healthy, that is, for any normal Vulcan on the high side of a hundred.#
MCCOY: You can leave, too, Lieutenant Galway. Lieutenant Galway?#
MCCOY: Yes, I spoke to you. I said that you could leave, too. Now why don't you go down to your quarters and get some sleep.#
MCCOY: People age normally at different speeds, Jim.#
MCCOY: I don't know.#
MCCOY: His genes. All right, nurse. Prepare Chekov for another complete physical.#
MCCOY: Then try that, Doctor Wallace. Try anything, but do it quickly.#
MCCOY: Radiation? That's as good an answer as any, but why didn't we know about it earlier?#
MCCOY:  Run this through, Doctor.#
MCCOY: Well, I see I'm not going to be making any house calls on you.#
MCCOY: I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor.#
MCCOY: Well, then we just start over, that's all. We work harder, faster, and we start completely from scratch if we have to. But we find something.#
MCCOY: Now this isn't going to hurt a bit.#
MCCOY: Did it hurt?#
MCCOY: She's dead. Her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than the rest of us, but the same thing's going to happen to us unless#
MCCOY: Oh, a matter of days. Perhaps hours.#
MCCOY:  Yes, Spock? What is it?#
MCCOY: I did.#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging.#
MCCOY: Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now#
MCCOY: It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine.#
MCCOY: Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim.#
MCCOY: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.#
MCCOY: Yes, yes. Now that could be. Right. Scared. Heart beats faster, breathe gets short, and there's cold sweats and adrenaline flows. Adrenal activity. Now hold on Just a minute. There was something that I read once. It was ancient history, just after the atomic age. Used for radiation sickness. Adrenaline.#
MCCOY: Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early research, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered.#
MCCOY: Don't just stand there jawing, Spock. You and Doctor Wallace get cracking.#
MCCOY: No, Jim. You can't do it.#
MCCOY: Nurse? Doctor Wallace!#
MCCOY: Nurse.;#
MCCOY: Jim-boy, you just lay quiet. You can't do no good. We're both through.#
MCCOY: All right. Let's, let's go.#
MCCOY: Don't give me any Vulcan details. Just give me the shot.#
MCCOY: You can't.#
MCCOY: Well, well, what's happening?#
MCCOY: Feeling fine. So is Scotty. The serum worked. He pulled a muscle during the reaction, but otherwise he's feeling fine.#
MCCOY: Oh, very well. A few bruises here and there. Oh. Anytime you're ready, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely potent shot for you. However, you might like to know I've removed all the breakables from Sickbay.#
MCCOY: I thought you'd be pleased to hear that.#
MCCOY: Yes. There's something odd about that man, and I can't quite pinpoint it.#
MCCOY: I know when something doesn't strike me right, and he doesn't.#
MCCOY: All right. There's something wrong about a man who never smiles, whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job, and who won't talk about his background.#
MCCOY: Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan. The ears make all the difference.#
MCCOY: Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone. Besides, he has avoided two appointments that I've made for his physical exam without reason.#
MCCOY: Oh, I find that shocking.#
MCCOY:  Harry, what's this?#
MCCOY: Dead?#
MCCOY: That's very interesting. You leave your wife and then bring her along.#
MCCOY: Then your makers weren't humanoid?#
MCCOY: I think Mister Chekov's right. We are in a lot of trouble.#
MCCOY: Jim, you should see the research facilities. They've got a lab down there that. Well, I could spend the rest of my life studying it.#
MCCOY: I wouldn't be bored, I can tell you that.#
MCCOY: I did. And you can forget it. They're perfect, flawless, mentally and physically. No weaknesses, perfectly disciplined. No vices, no fears, no faults. Just a sense of purpose. Believe me, there's nothing tougher to overcome, even among humans.#
MCCOY: How do you know so much?#
MCCOY: Oh.#
MCCOY: You wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself.#
MCCOY: He is dying.#
MCCOY: Completely inner directed. Oblivious to everything.#
MCCOY: All right, it's worked so far, but we're not out yet.#
MCCOY:  You offer us only well-being.#
MCCOY: Suffering, in torment and pain. Labouring without end.#
MCCOY: He's dead.#
MCCOY: Easy now. Oh, he's caught it!#
MCCOY: Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours. Logical, unemotional, completely pragmatic. And we poor, irrational humans whipped them in a fair fight. Now you'll find yourself back among us illogical humans again.#
MCCOY: How long have you had that thing, Lieutenant?#
MCCOY: Well, in that case, you got a bargain.#
MCCOY: Lieutenant, do you mind if I take one of these down to the lab to see what makes it tick?#
MCCOY: I won't harm a hair on its head, wherever that is.#
MCCOY: Hi, Jim.#
MCCOY: Let me guess. Klingons? Baris?#
MCCOY: Just one.#
MCCOY: You noticed that, huh? Here. This ought to take care of it.#
MCCOY: I haven't figured that out yet, but I can tell you this much. Almost fifty percent of the creature's metabolism is geared for reproduction. Do you know what you get if you feed a tribble too much?#
MCCOY: No. You get a bunch of hungry little tribbles.#
MCCOY: What's the matter, Spock?#
MCCOY: Don't tell me you've got a feeling.#
MCCOY: Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're nice, soft, and furry, and they make a pleasant sound.#
MCCOY: It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially if they're attractive in some way.#
MCCOY: Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet, but there's one thing that I have discovered.#
MCCOY: I like them better than I like you.#
MCCOY: Yes?#
MCCOY: What's that?#
MCCOY: Yes? Did you want to see me, Jim? Don't look at me. It's the tribbles who are breeding. If we don't get them off this ship, we're going to be hip deep in them.#
MCCOY: The nearest thing I can figure out is they're born pregnant, which seems to be quite a time saver.#
MCCOY: And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing at will. And, brother, have they got a lot of will.#
MCCOY: Jim, I think I've got it. All we have to do is quit feeding them. We quit feeding them, they stop breeding.#
MCCOY: A lot of them are dead. A lot of them are alive, but they won't be for long.#
MCCOY: I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet. All right, if I find out anything, I'll let you know.#
MCCOY:  Heartbeat is all wrong. His body temperature is. Jim, this man is a Klingon.#
MCCOY: Oh, yes. It was poisoned.#
MCCOY: Yes. It's been impregnated with a virus. The virus turns into an inert material in the bloodstream. The more the organism eats, the more inert matter is built up. So after two or three days, they reached a point where they couldn't take in enough nourishment to survive.#
MCCOY: That is essentially it.#
MCCOY: And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship.#
MCCOY: I cannot take credit for another man's work. Scotty did it.#
MCCOY: Tell him, Spock.#
MCCOY: The word was smog.#
MCCOY: I am not, Mister Spock. I was simply trying to stop you from giving us a whole lecture on the subject. Jim, is there anything at all we know about this planet?#
MCCOY: No references to space, or the fact that there are other worlds, or more advanced civilisations.#
MCCOY: One, just once, I'd like to be able to land someplace and say, Behold, I am the Archangel Gabriel.#
MCCOY: Naturally. You could hardly claim to be an angel with those pointed ears, Mister Spock. But say you landed someplace with a pitchfork.#
MCCOY: For which we are grateful, for we are men of peace ourselves.#
MCCOY: Well, if you're speaking of worships of sorts, we represent many beliefs.#
MCCOY: Odd that these people should worship the sun.#
MCCOY: Because, my dear Mister Spock, it is illogical. Rome had no sun worshipers. Why should they parallel Rome in every way except one?#
MCCOY: Quite logical, I'd say, Mister Spock. Just as it's logical that twentieth-century Rome would use television to show its gladiator contests or name a new car the Jupiter Eight.#
MCCOY: What term? Logic? Medical men are trained in logic, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: I do?#
MCCOY: No, I think I can walk. I'll try. (McCoy suddenly doubles over in pain and two guards are sent in to help. One gets neck-pinched, the Roman is karate-chopped and the last guard is punched by the invalid.)#
MCCOY: Are you out of your head?#
MCCOY: Next he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history.#
MCCOY: They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism.#
MCCOY: You must know that's impossible. Starfleet regulations#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: Must you always be so blasted honest?#
MCCOY: I am defending myself!#
MCCOY: Whatever gave you that idea?#
MCCOY: You tell him, buster. Of all the completely ridiculous, illogical questions I ever heard in my life! (McCoy falls, and is vulnerable. Achilles is distracted so Spock punches him out then goes and neck-pinches Flavius.)#
MCCOY: Angry, Mister Spock, or frustrated, perhaps?#
MCCOY: For the fifteenth time. Spock. Spock, I know we've had our disagreements. Maybe they're jokes. I don't know. As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves sometimes, but what I'm trying to say is#
MCCOY: Well, what I'm trying to say is you saved my life in the arena.#
MCCOY: I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin!#
MCCOY: Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock? You're more afraid of living. Each day you stay alive is just one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out. That's it, isn't it? Insecurity. Why, you wouldn't know what to do with a genuine, warm, decent feeling.#
MCCOY: I know. I'm worried about Jim, too.#
MCCOY: Jim!#
MCCOY: What happened, Jim?#
MCCOY: Captain, I see on your report Flavius was killed. I am sorry. I liked that huge sun worshiper.#
MCCOY: A philosophy of total love and total brotherhood.#
MCCOY: Dress uniforms, spit and polish. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to stand this. I feel like my neck's in a sling.#
MCCOY: Sure. A formal reception tonight, a hundred and fourteen delegates aboard for two weeks, thirty two of them ambassadors,  half of them mad at the other half, and the whole lot touchier than a raw antimatter pile over this Coridan question.#
MCCOY: How does that Vulcan salute go? (Spock demonstrates - right hand with the fingers separated into a V-sign.) MCCOY: That hurts worse than the uniform.#
MCCOY: Ambassador.#
MCCOY: Mister Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this conference was called. Forgive my curiosity, but as a doctor, I'm interested in Vulcan physiology. Isn't it unusual for a Vulcan to retire at your age? After all, you're only a hundred and two.#
MCCOY: Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human than you let on. Mrs. Sarek, I know about the rigorous training of the Vulcan youth, but tell me, did he ever run and play like the human children, even in secret?#
MCCOY: Sehlat?#
MCCOY: A teddy bear?#
MCCOY: A teddy bear.#
MCCOY: His neck was broken. By an expert.#
MCCOY: Well, from the nature and location of the break, I'd say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly.#
MCCOY: Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect?#
MCCOY: His neck was broken, Mister Ambassador, by what Spock describes as tal-shaya.#
MCCOY: It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology, but I believe it's something to do with his cardiovascular system.#
MCCOY: I don't know that yet either.#
MCCOY: As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valve. It's similar to a heart attack in a human. But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell without an operation. Mrs. Sarek, has he had any previous attacks?#
MCCOY: I'm not sure. It's tough enough on a human. On a Vulcan, an ordinary operation's out of the question.#
MCCOY: Well, I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here. Well, the procedure they're discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient.#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: Yes, I'd say that's rare.#
MCCOY: Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock. It would kill you.#
MCCOY: Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood.#
MCCOY: I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian.#
MCCOY: Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental.#
MCCOY: Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level.#
MCCOY: Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before. Oh, I've studied the anatomical types. I know where all the organs are. But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience. So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will.#
MCCOY: A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body. It's only experimental.#
MCCOY: It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him.#
MCCOY: What has that got#
MCCOY: It could damage you internally. It could kill you. I'm sorry, Spock. I can't sanction it.#
MCCOY: It's a bad wound. Punctured left lung. A centimetre or so lower, it'd have gone through the heart.#
MCCOY: Spock, your father is much worse. There's no longer a choice. I have to operate immediately. We can begin as soon as you're prepared.#
MCCOY: What?#
MCCOY: You can turn command over to Scotty.#
MCCOY: Now let that be a lesson to you. Just lie there and be happy you're still alive.#
MCCOY: Not good. If I could only operate.#
MCCOY: I was. When you became injured, Spock assumed command. He's going to stay there until you're back on your feet, even if it costs Sarek his life. Regulations.#
MCCOY: Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again.#
MCCOY: I've certified him physically fit, Mister Spock. Now since I have an operation to perform and both of us are required#
MCCOY: Readings, Nurse.#
MCCOY: I wish I knew whether that was good or bad. Initiate sterile field.#
MCCOY: Where do you think you're going?#
MCCOY: My patients don't walk out in the middle of an operation.#
MCCOY: So is your father's life.#
MCCOY: One more like that, and I'm going to lose both these men.#
MCCOY: Cardio-stimulate.#
MCCOY: Then get me that old portable cardio-stimulator.#
MCCOY: Call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority.#
MCCOY: Are you quite through shaking the ship around?#
MCCOY: I don't mind telling you, you sure make it difficult for a surgeon trying#
MCCOY: That pig-headed Vulcan stamina. I couldn't have pulled them through without it.#
MCCOY: Orion?#
MCCOY: If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here. If you co-operate, you'll be out in two.#
MCCOY: You are at your station, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Shut up.  Shh. Shh!  Well, what do you know? I finally got the last word.#
MCCOY: Yes, Jim.#
MCCOY: Oh, about another thirty minutes. I've come across some most interesting organic compounds. Hey, Starfleet was right.#
MCCOY: Enterprise, alert! Stand by to beam up landing party.#
MCCOY: Now, Scotty. Have medics stand by.#
MCCOY: Pressure packet. Lucky his heart's where his liver should be, or he'd be dead now.#
MCCOY: Coranalin.#
MCCOY: I don't know yet, Jim.#
MCCOY: Agreed. Sterilite off.#
MCCOY: He'll live or die now, Jim. I don't know which. Doctor M'Benga interned on a Vulcan ward. He couldn't be in better hands.#
MCCOY: I can't leave Spock at this time.#
MCCOY: And if that's not it?#
MCCOY: I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but#
MCCOY: Want to think about it again, Jim? Starfleet's orders about this planet state no interference with#
MCCOY: I read it. Inhabitants superior in many ways to humans. Left alone, they undoubtedly someday will develop a remarkably advanced and peaceful culture.#
MCCOY: Do I have a choice? (So they make their way down the slope, and Kirk gets pounced on by a big white ape with a large horn on it's head and spines down it's back. It easily throws off McCoy as it concentrates on it's first victim, biting him, Throwing rocks makes it stand up, then McCoy vaporizes it with his phaser.)#
MCCOY: Enterprise, McCoy. Emergency. Come in. Enterprise, come in. McCoy! Emergency!#
MCCOY:  Jim, there is no antitoxin for this poison. I can only keep you alive a few hours with this.#
MCCOY: Are you hill people? Do you know a hunter named Tyree? A mugato attacked him. He's James Kirk. He's a friend of Tyree's. Blast it! Do something! He's dying!#
MCCOY: You and your Garden of Eden.#
MCCOY: What's that?#
MCCOY: A plant? It moves.#
MCCOY: How do you feel, Jim?#
MCCOY: I want to thank you for saving his life. (Nona's hand is healed too) I would like to learn more about this.#
MCCOY: He is hers?#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: Have you seen any strangers among the villagers?#
MCCOY: Many ways? What else does she know about us?#
MCCOY: A splendid custom if not carried to extremes.#
MCCOY: What's bothering you, Jim? If we find the Klingons have helped the villagers, there's certainly something we can do.#
MCCOY: Jim, this man believes in the same thing we believe in. That killing is stupid and useless.#
MCCOY: Jim. Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder.#
MCCOY:  This pig iron is almost carbon-free. That village furnace certainly didn't produce it. People's exhibit number two. Cold-rolled gun barrel rod fashioned to look homemade. You were right about the Klingons, Jim.#
MCCOY: Right. It's a pity we can't include a live Klingon. That'd just about wrap it#
MCCOY: Jim, I want to talk to you.#
MCCOY: Do I have to say it? It's not bad enough there's one serpent in Eden teaching one side about gun powder. You want to make sure they all know about it!#
MCCOY: Have you gone out of your mind? Yes, maybe you have. Tyree's wife, she said there was something in that root. She said now you can refuse her nothing.#
MCCOY: Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants?#
MCCOY: Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war that may never end. It could go on for year after year, massacre after massacre.#
MCCOY: I don't have a solution. But furnishing them firearms is certainly not the answer.#
MCCOY: Yes, I remember. It went on bloody year after bloody year.#
MCCOY: And if the Klingons give their side even more?#
MCCOY: And what about your friend Tyree? Will he understand this balance of power?#
MCCOY: Well, Jim, here's another morsel of agony for you. Since Tyree won't fight, he will be one of the first to die.#
MCCOY: Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick. Where is it?#
MCCOY: That's a fine thing to leave lying around. Show us where it is.#
MCCOY: Jim? Jim. Who hit you?#
MCCOY: She's dead.#
MCCOY: Here.#
MCCOY: Well, you got what you wanted.#
MCCOY: Spock, are you alive?#
MCCOY: Well, I don't know why I was worried. You can't kill a computer.#
MCCOY: Then what the devil is happening? Does that mean their atoms are just floating around out there?#
MCCOY: A negative attitude is no good to us. We can't just leave them out there, wherever they are.#
MCCOY: Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: It's been nearly an hour. Can people live that long as disassembled atoms in a transporter beam?#
MCCOY: Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if they're still alive.#
MCCOY: The odds are not good.#
MCCOY: Don't quote odds and don't give me anymore dispassionate logic, Mister Spock. Just keep looking for them.#
MCCOY: First time you've ever asked me for anything, and it has to be an occasion like this.#
MCCOY: What would account for that, Spock?#
MCCOY: You're going to leave here without them and run off on some wild goose chase halfway across the galaxy just because you found a discrepancy in a hydrogen cloud?#
MCCOY: This is ridiculous. There's nothing out there. Nothing at all.#
MCCOY: Are you suggesting that they could have transported over a distance of? You're out of your Vulcan mind, Spock.#
MCCOY: If they weren't there it's ridiculous to think they could still be alive. Not after all this time.#
MCCOY: He's right, Spock. We've lost Jim and the others on Gamma Two. Now you've dragged us a dozen light years on some wild hunch that#
MCCOY: No, it doesn't. It's still a fancy way of saying that you're playing a hunch. well, my hunch is that they're back on Gamma Two dead or alive and I still want another search.#
MCCOY: Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared. All right. If we don't find them here, do we still have another search on Gamma Two?#
MCCOY: Well, at least that gives our landing force a starting point.#
MCCOY: Well we're not going to leave them there while we just sit and wait.#
MCCOY: And it may be just a wild goose chase like we've been telling you.#
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock, if you're going into the lion's den, you'll need a medical officer.#
MCCOY: What in the name of heaven is this?#
MCCOY: Transfusions?#
MCCOY: Jim, the Yorktown's ship surgeon will want to know how late. Those vaccines he's transferring to us are highly perishable.#
MCCOY: You saw their colour. There wasn't a red corpuscle left in their bodies.#
MCCOY: Not a one. What happened is medically impossible.#
MCCOY: Thank you, Captain. I'll check those tapes immediately.#
MCCOY: Yes, but it#
MCCOY: In his present condition, I don't think it would make much difference.#
MCCOY: Give him one cc of cordazine, nurse.#
MCCOY: He's beginning to sleep again. I can't risk another shot.#
MCCOY: I wouldn't depend too much what he says in that half-conscious state. He could be dreaming, saying what he thought you wanted to hear.#
MCCOY: I intend to find out. I'll be in the medical record library.#
MCCOY: Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud?#
MCCOY: Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a creature. A living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of chemical elements?#
MCCOY: You were a little hard on the boy, Jim.#
MCCOY: Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Mister Spock. It's a relief.#
MCCOY: Then I need a drink.#
MCCOY: You need advice from me? You must be kidding.#
MCCOY: Jim and his creature?#
MCCOY: No. With all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance to scan the tapes. There are eight or ten hours of record tape there.#
MCCOY: The same as our Ensign.#
MCCOY: Mind if I come in?#
MCCOY: Sometimes they do, if we're lucky. Monsters come in many forms. You know the greatest monster of them all, Jim? Guilt.#
MCCOY: Jim, When a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the first time, he's under tremendous emotional stress. Now we all know that.#
MCCOY: Am I? I was speaking of Lieutenant James T. Kirk of the starship Farragut. Eleven years ago, you were the young officer at the phaser station when something attacked. According to the tapes, this young Lieutenant Kirk insisted upon blaming himself.#
MCCOY: You had a normal emotion. You were startled. You delayed firing for a grand total of perhaps two seconds.#
MCCOY: The ship's exec didn't seem to think so. His log entry was quite clear on the subject. Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery.#
MCCOY: Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim?#
MCCOY: You don't know that, Jim. You don't know that any more than you know that Garrovick could have destroyed it.#
MCCOY: To be so obsessed.#
MCCOY: That you could destroy yourself, your career, a young boy who reminds you of yourself eleven years ago.#
MCCOY: I'm not, Jim. This is professional, Captain. I am preparing a medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of a starship captain. Which requires a witness of command grade.#
MCCOY: They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain. Now why are we delaying here?#
MCCOY: You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness. A semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing. A man never knows how much is real or how much is imagination.#
MCCOY: Yes, there's no doubt about that.#
MCCOY: Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you.#
MCCOY: At this point, my medical log remains open.#
MCCOY: What's that?#
MCCOY:  A survey on Cygnian Respiratory Diseases? I thought you took Garrovick some food. What were you doing with this?#
MCCOY: One man has a chance for survival. The other is dead. You can add that little price tag to your monster hunt.#
MCCOY: It's not enough! You didn't care as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall. Well, it's not on it, Captain, it's in it.#
MCCOY: Creature, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Jim. I was wrong. SPOCK; Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago, it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact, there was no fault.#
MCCOY: Jim, Spock may be dying.#
MCCOY: It's that green blood of his.#
MCCOY: I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too.#
MCCOY: I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it.#
MCCOY: It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are perishable.#
MCCOY: I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the creature?#
MCCOY: Do something.#
MCCOY: Crazy way to travel, spreading a man's molecules all over the universe.#
MCCOY: Well then, thank pitchforks and pointed ears. As long as it worked, Jim.#
MCCOY: The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it?#
MCCOY: What is it, Spock? Are you in pain?#
MCCOY: Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay.#
MCCOY: All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust these crazy Vulcan readings. Spock, how can you be so sure the lntrepid was destroyed?#
MCCOY: But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject before#
MCCOY: Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die.#
MCCOY: But four hundred Vulcans?#
MCCOY: Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish that on us, would you?#
MCCOY: Not unless she's feeling ill. I've got an emergency here.#
MCCOY: There's nothing organic. They all seem to be nervous, weak, and irritable. They say it happened suddenly, like a balloon popping.#
MCCOY: I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet.#
MCCOY: A stimulant.#
MCCOY: Two thirds of the personnel are affected.#
MCCOY: No. You know you'll get everything I can tell you. But when there is nothing, what should I say?#
MCCOY: Nurse.#
MCCOY: I have one. I recommend survival. Let's get out of here.#
MCCOY: Sickbay to Captain Kirk.#
MCCOY: Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels#
MCCOY: According to the life monitors, we're dying.#
MCCOY: Stimulants. I don't know how long we can keep this up.#
MCCOY: But at a dangerously low level. Well, we're still alive. I suppose that's something.#
MCCOY: All I can contribute is the further we travel into this zone of darkness, the weaker our life functions become, and I have no idea why. I'm all right. It's those stimulants. They catch up with you. KIRK; Engineering.#
MCCOY: That is an amoeba.#
MCCOY: Yes, for lack of a better term. It's a very simple form of life. In fact it's a much simpler form of life than what you're looking at now. But that thing can apparently perform all the functions that qualify it as a living organism. It can reproduce, it can breathe, it can eat, although I don't know what.#
MCCOY: It's one of the things we've got to find out. We've got to take a closer look at it.#
MCCOY: Perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft. Perhaps with a protective shield#
MCCOY: We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots.#
MCCOY: Who said anything about an order, Jim? You've got a volunteer. I've done the preliminary work.#
MCCOY: All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots.#
MCCOY: Do you think I intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory since#
MCCOY: Just because the Vulcans failed#
MCCOY: You don't think you're going?#
MCCOY: Jim, that organism contains chemical processes we've never seen before and may never see again. We could learn more in one day#
MCCOY: Jim#
MCCOY: Nothing has been proven yet, Spock. The DNA code analyser will give you the fundamental structure of the thing. You'll need readings on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder.#
MCCOY: You're determined not to let me share in this, aren't you?#
MCCOY: Vulcan dignity? How can I grant you what I don't understand?#
MCCOY: Good luck, Spock.#
MCCOY: You want to bet?#
MCCOY: Well, all I know is, that soon there'll be two, four, eight, and more. The entire anti-life matter that that thing puts out could someday encompass the entire galaxy.#
MCCOY: How do you feel?#
MCCOY: Spock. Is it me, Jim? Am I so sentimental that I just have to keep believing that he's still alive in that mass of protoplasm?#
MCCOY: It's a disease, like a virus invading the body of our galaxy.#
MCCOY: Millions.#
MCCOY: Now, isn't that a thought? Here we are, antibodies of our own galaxy, attacking an invading germ. It would be ironic indeed if that were our sole destiny, wouldn't it?#
MCCOY: Technically, no. Medically, yes. Between the stimulants and the pressure, I would suggest you try to stay off your feet for a few minutes.#
MCCOY: We couldn't use it. We'd cook ourselves along with that mess of protoplasm out there#
MCCOY: What?#
MCCOY: How close are you going to it?#
MCCOY: Why? The probe has a range of#
MCCOY: How long do you think you can keep taking that stuff? It'll blow you apart.#
MCCOY: Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive.#
MCCOY: Spock?#
MCCOY: Shut up, Spock! We're rescuing you.#
MCCOY: Don't be so smart, Spock. You botched the acetylcholine test.#
MCCOY: They must have interfered with the normal evolution of the planet.#
MCCOY: What was the state of the Iotian culture before the Horizon came?#
MCCOY: So we're going down to recontaminate them.#
MCCOY: This is like coming home.#
MCCOY: Well, those firearms are not necessary.#
MCCOY: Who, me?#
MCCOY: What?#
MCCOY: Well, since this Oxmyx asked us down here, don't you think we should see him?#
MCCOY: That man's dead back there.#
MCCOY: This is the contamination you're looking for, Jim.#
MCCOY: Yes. Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree.#
MCCOY: You said they were imitative, and the book#
MCCOY: One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this. It's amazing.#
MCCOY: It's the Bible.#
MCCOY: Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all.#
MCCOY: Jim, you can't#
MCCOY: You do that very well. Now, how are you with primitive radio equipment?#
MCCOY: And very simple.#
MCCOY: Well?#
MCCOY: You mean you're giving up?#
MCCOY: You mean you're going to trust him?#
MCCOY: Now you're beginning to make sense.#
MCCOY: We're trying to help you, Oxmyx.#
MCCOY: You admit that?#
MCCOY: What are we going to do now, Jim?#
MCCOY: Where are they?#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: I don't know how serious this is, Jim, and I don't quite know how to tell you#
MCCOY: But in all the confusion I#
MCCOY: I think I left it in Bela's office.#
MCCOY: Somewhere. I'm not certain.#
MCCOY: I left my communicator.#
MCCOY: You really think it's that serious?#
MCCOY: How do you mean?#
MCCOY: Well, somebody sent a distress call.#
MCCOY: In other words, the galaxy isn't big enough for both of us.#
MCCOY: They registered as human.#
MCCOY: Yes. If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance.#
MCCOY: Spock, are you sure you're all right?#
MCCOY: You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch.#
MCCOY: Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are?#
MCCOY: Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt themselves to our bodies?#
MCCOY: Well, that's enough. One wrong move, and they jam all our neural circuits.#
MCCOY: How?#
MCCOY: It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's healthy.#
MCCOY: Jim, his heartbeat really is slow. His pulse is practically non-existent.;#
MCCOY: He may die. If I can get him up to sickbay, there's a chance he'll live.#
MCCOY: Prepare two ccs of stokaline.#
MCCOY: Don't argue, nurse. Just get it.  This may be the turning point. Prepare another shot.#
MCCOY: Please, nurse, just follow orders, will you? (Spock opens his eyes then shuts them again before she returns with the hypo. McCoy gives another injection as Tomar watches from a little distance.) MCCOY: There, that should do it. Just let him rest now.  You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba Fever. He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then. There's no danger if he gets medication in time. He'll be all right in a couple of hours.#
MCCOY: We're just going to jam it.#
MCCOY: Scotty tells me you could've destroyed the ship in the barrier. Why didn't you?#
MCCOY: But that was our only chance to stop them#
MCCOY: Jim#
MCCOY: Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those little#
MCCOY: Before you condemn it, why not try it?#
MCCOY: All right, I'll show you how to work the selector. (He gets a tray of food for Tomar and sits him down at another table. Tomar takes a cautious mouthful.)#
MCCOY: I'm delighted.#
MCCOY: If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet.#
MCCOY: I don't know about that.#
MCCOY: Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic. Comes from taking food in pills instead of solid sustenance.#
MCCOY: I'm going to give you a shot. High-potency vitamin concentrate. You'll need three a day for a few days. And eat some solid food, will you?#
MCCOY: Well, now, let's see. You've had three shots. I think you better stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you're responding.#
MCCOY: We haven't seen Tomar either. But my man Hanar is getting more irritable by the minute. I'm giving him shots of formazine. That should have him climbing the walls.#
MCCOY: Hmm?#
MCCOY: Oh. You will pardon us.#
MCCOY: Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice.#
MCCOY: Jim, why no briefing on this? I'd at least like to know what we're getting into.#
MCCOY: Inside solid rock?#
MCCOY: Let's get back to this solid rock business. Just how much rock are we going to go through?#
MCCOY: Miles? Are you joking?#
MCCOY: No. No, if I'd be useful, as long as you're going down, I might as well take a medical look at whatever this is. (The landing party and two guards gather on the pads, Scotty stands sulking with arms crossed as the transporter activates, and just sends the four officers somewhere.)#
MCCOY: The air seems fresh. It must be re-circulated somehow.#
MCCOY: But you once had a body of some type?#
MCCOY: Where's our captain? Where's Jim Kirk?#
MCCOY:  I won't go along with this. Back to where you were, Sargon, or whatever you are.#
MCCOY: Are you aware of what's happening to his body? Heart action doubled, temperature a hundred and four degrees?#
MCCOY: And destroy them, just as you're burning that one up now. Heartbeat's two hundred and sixty two, Spock. Entire metabolic rate correspondingly high.#
MCCOY: Is it you, Jim?  Good, his metabolic rate is back to normal.#
MCCOY: He doesn't appear to be harmed. Physically, anyway.#
MCCOY: That's the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard. An alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into a bottle and#
MCCOY: And what if we should decide against you?#
MCCOY: No comment.#
MCCOY: Quite simple. Happens every day.#
MCCOY: It all seems rather indecent to me.#
MCCOY: They're giants, and we're insects beside them. They could destroy us without meaning to. And all he wants is the body of our captain and our second in command, too. Coincidence?#
MCCOY: What's your attitude on that, Doctor?#
MCCOY: Then I'll still want one question answered to my satisfaction. Why? Not a list of possible miracles, but a simple basic understandable why that overrides all danger. And let's not kid ourselves that there is no potential danger in this.#
MCCOY: The extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high, and The body functions will race many times their normal metabolism, so we're going to have to monitor this very carefully.#
MCCOY: Well, I guess we're as ready as we'll ever be, Jim.#
MCCOY: Vulcans worship peace above all, Henoch.#
MCCOY: Nurse!#
MCCOY: Henoch, you'd better get back to bed too.#
MCCOY: Sargon, it won't work. You've got to get out before you kill them.#
MCCOY: A what?#
MCCOY: It was close, Jim. You both barely got back alive. Unless the formula works, we can't risk it again.#
MCCOY: As planned, the construction of android robots is underway. All is proceeding as expected and as promised. I can find no reason for concern, but yet I am filled with foreboding.#
MCCOY: Nurse, how are the last metabolic readings on our patients?#
MCCOY: Is something wrong, Miss Chapel?#
MCCOY: Regarding our patients?#
MCCOY: You look tired, Miss Chapel. Perhaps you'd care for me to administer the last few injections.#
MCCOY: Hypo.#
MCCOY: He's dead. Medical Log. Stardate 4770.3. Do I list one death or two? When Kirk's body died, Sargon was too far distant from his receptacle to transfer back. Sargon is dead. But is Captain Kirk dead? His body is, but his consciousness is still in the receptacle into which it was transferred earlier.#
MCCOY: Yes, we can keep them going for a few weeks, or a month. For all the good it'll do.#
MCCOY: Yes?#
MCCOY: But you said that was impossible.#
MCCOY: I see. And Henoch intends to keep Spock's body, of course.#
MCCOY: If you're asking my approval#
MCCOY: Neither Jim nor I can trade a body we don't own. It happens to belong to a young woman.#
MCCOY: I will not peddle flesh. I'm a physician.#
MCCOY: This is Sickbay. Get me#
MCCOY: Nurse Chapel, what in the devil?#
MCCOY: Jim? Are you all right?#
MCCOY: Thalassa?#
MCCOY: Jim, the receptacles. Spock's consciousness was in one of them.#
MCCOY: What are you talking about? There is no Spock to return to his body. You've killed a loyal officer, your best friend.#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: There was enough poison in that hypo to kill ten Vulcans.#
MCCOY: Sargon.#
MCCOY: Starfleet's been trying for six months. If he's alive, isn't it unlikely that he'd receive us now?#
MCCOY: That's generations ahead of where these people should be technically. How'd they manage that?#
MCCOY: He must be dead. And what's going on down there on Ekos?#
MCCOY: Stupid computer made a mistake in the measurements. The right boot's too tight.#
MCCOY: How do you do? What in blazes is this?#
MCCOY: He looks drugged, Jim. Almost at a cataleptic state.#
MCCOY: I have to have a close look at him.#
MCCOY: Definitely drugged, almost comatose.#
MCCOY: I can't identify it without a medi-comp. Without knowing, an antidote would be dangerous.#
MCCOY: I can give him a general stimulant, but it would be risky.#
MCCOY: I'm working in the dark. I could kill him.#
MCCOY: The stimulant's working.#
MCCOY: He's reaching a level of consciousness. It's almost like he's in a light sleep. Now, that's as much as I dare do.#
MCCOY: He's still alive, but the drug they use is too strong. If I give him another shot#
MCCOY: I don't dare.#
MCCOY: What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much power, even with the best intentions, just can't resist the urge to play God.#
MCCOY: It also proves another Earth saying. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Darn clever, these Earthmen, wouldn't you say?#
MCCOY: Spock, you obviously don't understand#
MCCOY: I don't like it, Jim. A vessel this size cannot be run by one computer.#
MCCOY: Maybe you're trying to prove that, Spock; but don't count me in on it.#
MCCOY: Very funny. If it could, they wouldn't have to replace me. I'd resign because everybody else aboard would be nothing but circuits and memory banks. You know the type, Spock. Jim, you haven't had much to say about this.#
MCCOY: Frankly, the only fact that I'm concerned about is if this thing doesn't work, there are not enough men aboard to run the ship. That's begging for trouble.#
MCCOY: Doctor Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer.#
MCCOY: Is it supposed to do that?#
MCCOY: Did you see the love light in Spock's eyes? The right computer finally came along. What's the matter, Jim?#
MCCOY: I think it's wrong, too, replacing men with mindless machines.#
MCCOY: Jim, we've all seen the advances of mechanisation. After all, Daystrom did design the computers that run this ship.#
MCCOY: We're all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to a machine. When it comes to your job, that's different. And it always will be different.#
MCCOY: Jim, if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question, you don't need me to answer it for you. Why don't you ask James T. Kirk? He's a pretty honest guy.#
MCCOY: All the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5 is informed there are patients to be cared for.#
MCCOY: Dunsel? Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel? What does it mean, Jim?  Spock? What does it mean?#
MCCOY: This isn't chicken soup. I may be just a ship's doctor, but I make a Finagle's Folly that's known from here to Orion. I strongly prescribe it, Jim.#
MCCOY: To James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: Simple but effective.#
MCCOY: It's a line from a poem. A very old poem, isn't it?#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: Fantastic machine, the M-5. No off switch.#
MCCOY: Normal? That thing's trying to tell us nothing has happened.#
MCCOY: There certainly does. Your brilliant young computer just destroyed an ore freighter. In fact it went out of its way to destroy an ore freighter!#
MCCOY: In which case you'd be guilty of murder.#
MCCOY: And communications and fire control.#
MCCOY: I'll get the man responsible in the first place. Where is Daystrom?#
MCCOY: Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating.#
MCCOY: Have you found a solution, a way to shut that thing off?#
MCCOY: Learning to kill.#
MCCOY: That thing is a danger to us all. Now find some way to shut it off.#
MCCOY: The biographical tape of Richard Daystrom.#
MCCOY: Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius.#
MCCOY: In his early twenties, Jim. That's over a quarter of a century ago.#
MCCOY: Maybe that's the trouble. Where do you go from up? You publish articles, you give lectures, then spend your life trying to recapture past glory.#
MCCOY: The M-1 through M-4, remember? Not entirely successful. That's the way Daystrom put it.#
MCCOY: Right. The government bought it, then Daystrom had to make it work. And he did. But according to Spock, it works illogically.#
MCCOY: Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed perhaps, he'd still tend to protect that child.#
MCCOY: I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it.#
MCCOY: Decoyed. It wanted us to waste our time.#
MCCOY: But M-5 doesn't know it's a game.#
MCCOY: If that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships, we're in#
MCCOY: Of course.#
MCCOY: I don't like the sound of him, Jim.#
MCCOY: Jim, he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown, if not insanity.#
MCCOY: He'll have to be committed to a total rehabilitation centre. Right now he's under sedation and heavy restraints.#
MCCOY: Compassion. That's the one thing no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Care to debate that, Spock?#
MCCOY: But tell me, which do you prefer to have around?#
MCCOY: I was just trying to make conversation, Spock.#
MCCOY: Jim, the analysis of this so far is potassium thirty five percent, carbon eighteen percent, phosphorous one point zero, calcium one point five. Jim, the crew didn't leave. They're still here.#
MCCOY: These white crystals. That's what's left of the human body when you take the water away, which makes up ninety six percent of our bodies. Without water, we're all just three or four pounds of chemicals. Something crystallised them down to this.#
MCCOY:: Lucky we found that log. If we'd gone back to the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: Tell the lab the final reading on our tissue is Y three X point zero zero four. And I could use a second blood analyser unit.#
MCCOY: Our tissues definitely show a massive infection, Jim, but something is immunising us down here, thank heavens, or we'd have been dead hours ago.#
MCCOY: The problem is, it could be anything Some spores or pollen in the air, some chemical. Just finding it could take months, maybe even years. And I've only got one lead. The infection resembles one developed by Earth during their bacteriological warfare experiments in the 1990s. Hard to believe we were once foolish enough to play around with that. (Spock bursts in, helping an injured Galloway who is clutching his chest.)#
MCCOY: Now wait a minute. He lost his ship and his crew, and he found himself the only thing standing between an entire village of peaceful people.#
MCCOY: Without a serum, we're trapped here with the villagers. Now why destroy what's left of the man by arresting him?#
MCCOY: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.#
MCCOY: Good morning, Jim.#
MCCOY: Yes. I'm convinced that once there was a frightening biological war that existed here. The virus still exists. Then over the years, nature built up these natural immunising agents in the food, the water, and the soil.#
MCCOY: That's right. These immunising agents take time, and that's the real tragedy. Had the Exeter landing party stayed here just a few hours longer, they never would have died.#
MCCOY: Survival of the fittest, because their ancestors who survived had to have a superior resistance. Then they built up these powerful protective antibodies in the blood during the wars. Now, if you want to destroy a civilisation or a whole world, your descendants might develop a longer life, but I hardly think it's worth it.#
MCCOY: Who knows? It might eventually cure the common cold, but lengthen lives? Poppycock. I can do more for you if you just eat right and exercise regularly.#
MCCOY: He'll live, but I'll have to get him to better facilities than this.#
MCCOY: He's fully immunised now. We all are.#
MCCOY: Leave medicine to medical men, Captain. You found no fountain of youth here. People live longer here now because it's natural for them to.#
MCCOY: He must have attention soon.#
MCCOY: You're a romantic, Jim.#
MCCOY: His heart is different! The internal organs of a Vulcan are#
MCCOY: Spock, I've found that evil usually triumphs unless good is very, very careful.#
MCCOY: Spock, we've got to do something!#
MCCOY: What are you doing?#
MCCOY: Jim, what's going on down there?#
MCCOY: McCoy here.#
MCCOY: Acknowledged.#
MCCOY: Well, I must admit the sensor readings seem too good. Human readings, yes, but not a single physical flaw. Totally perfect body.#
MCCOY: I knew it had to happen. It's a fine time for that transporter mechanism to break down.#
MCCOY: It's just bits and pieces. It's incomplete.#
MCCOY: In the midst of what seems so unreal, the harsh reality. This is not a dream.#
MCCOY: Tombstone. Hell for leather, right out of history.#
MCCOY: What's the matter with us? We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881.#
MCCOY: Very dead, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: What's the matter?#
MCCOY: Taos Lightning straight bourbon. Try some. In small amounts, it was considered medicinal.#
MCCOY: Take it easy, Mister Scott. I hate to think what that stuff's doing to your stomach lining.#
MCCOY: Or a communicator. It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly four fifty nine thirty.#
MCCOY: Well let's get there.#
MCCOY: Mister Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying to find a way out of here, and quit explaining why we can't get out of here.#
MCCOY: A tranquilliser. Of course, Jim. I can make a tranquilliser!#
MCCOY: I know the place to get the proper drugs. I'll need a mortar and a pestle.#
MCCOY: Well, thank you. Mind if I look around a bit? (checking the bottles) Crude, but very useable.#
MCCOY: Oh, you don't have to worry. I know how to handle this. I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug, too.#
MCCOY: Oh, so you're the dentist. Well, I'm a physician, and I have a serious emergency. I wonder if you mind if I borrow a small quantity of this.#
MCCOY: My name is McCoy. I'm a doctor.#
MCCOY: The emergency is real. I need these things.#
MCCOY: That is my intention, Doctor.#
MCCOY: There's nothing I can do, Jim.#
MCCOY: Let it go, Jim. He's dead.#
MCCOY: We all knew the risk when we joined the service. Now let it go.#
MCCOY: You talk about another man's feelings. What do you feel, Spock?#
MCCOY: Because there are no feelings to discuss.#
MCCOY: Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty. It's human.#
MCCOY: We don't have much time.#
MCCOY: Get to the point, Spock.#
MCCOY: I'll have it ready before Spock.#
MCCOY: And if we fight them, we all die. We know that.#
MCCOY: I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this.#
MCCOY: Three or four seconds.#
MCCOY: It's not necessary, Captain. It's very simple. Nothing can go wrong.#
MCCOY: It would.#
MCCOY: Guaranteed.#
MCCOY: It should have worked. Did you inhale the gas, Scotty?#
MCCOY: You still feel all right?#
MCCOY: No dizziness? No sweating? No palpitations?#
MCCOY: Nothing could go wrong, Captain. It should work.#
MCCOY: You don't have to worry about that now, Jim. Look at the clock.#
MCCOY: Then we'd better become experts, and fast.#
MCCOY: What do you mean, Spock?#
MCCOY: A piece of lead in his body.#
MCCOY: Come on, Spock. If you've got the answer, tell us.#
MCCOY: What do you mean unreal? I examined Chekov. He's dead.#
MCCOY: But that's not possible. There'd always be some doubt.#
MCCOY: We're just human beings, Spock. We don't have that clockwork ticker in our head like you do. We can't turn it on and off.#
MCCOY: They do not exist.#
MCCOY: Neither do I. He's in perfect health.#
MCCOY: But he didn't kill, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: That's just the negative part, Mister Spock. I've been over those records. Now the women, they're supposed to be something very special. They're supposed to have a kind of subtle, mystical power that drives men wild.#
MCCOY: It was a deep wound, Jim. He lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover.#
MCCOY: Well, I've heard of reluctant brides, but this is ridiculous.#
MCCOY: The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried to murder the groom's ambassador.#
MCCOY: It'll be a few days. A week, at least, Jim.#
MCCOY: Neck snapped clean.#
MCCOY: Jim. Jim! May we please have a word with you?#
MCCOY: Did she cry, Jim?#
MCCOY: Did she cry? Did her tears touch you at any time?#
MCCOY: Oh, we're in trouble. Now listen, Jim. Petri told Christine that the Elasian women have a sort of a biochemical substance in their tears that acts like a super love potion. And according to him, it doesn't wear off.#
MCCOY: I'll try, but I'll need tests and#
MCCOY: Results also negative.#
MCCOY: It is my time to waste, Ambassador.#
MCCOY: That is the captain's responsibility, Ambassador.#
MCCOY: Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian tears. It's a kind of an infection, and I think I've found an antidote.#
MCCOY: Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Do you know how long I've worked on#
MCCOY: Well, I doubt seriously if there's any kind of an antidote for the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: Look at those pine trees.#
MCCOY: I swear that's honeysuckle I smell.#
MCCOY: What in blazes is that?#
MCCOY: Meadows and no meteor craters. The whole place is an enigma, biologically and culturally.#
MCCOY: Why, they look like. I'd swear they're American Indians.#
MCCOY: Shouldn't we contact them, Jim? Tell them?#
MCCOY: What's the matter, Jim?#
MCCOY: Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting. Back in the twentieth century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome. It's particularly common to over-pressured leader types, like starship captains.#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: Leaving? You can't be serious, Spock.#
MCCOY: The devil with an asteroid! It won't get here for two months, Spock!#
MCCOY: In the meantime, what about Jim?#
MCCOY: That may be hours from now. He may be injured or dying.#
MCCOY: Can a few more minutes matter, Spock?#
MCCOY: What for?#
MCCOY: It might also cripple the ship, and we would be crushed by the asteroid.#
MCCOY: Jim won't be able to get out of its path.#
MCCOY: You sound like you're cutting a diamond.#
MCCOY: Well, Spock, you took your calculated risk in your calculated Vulcan way, and you lost. You lost for us, you lost for that planet, and you lost for Jim.#
MCCOY: And my responsibility is the health of this crew. You've been driving yourself too hard, and I want you to get some rest.#
MCCOY: Back to that planet? Without warp speed, it'll take months, Spock.#
MCCOY: Well then what's the use? We might not be able to save the captain even if he still is alive. We might not be able to save anything, including this ship! You haven't heard a word I've said. All you've been doing is staring at that blasted obelisk.#
MCCOY: I thought you were reporting to Sickbay.#
MCCOY: You've been trying to do that ever since we started back to that planet. Fifty eight days.#
MCCOY: Well, you won't read them by killing yourself. You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks. Now if you don't let up, you're going to collapse.#
MCCOY: Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured, and as for the pressure, that green ice water you call blood#
MCCOY: Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and guilt. You're blaming yourself for crippling this ship, just as we blamed you. Well, we were wrong. So were you. You made a command decision. Jim would have done the same. My prescription is rest, now. Do I have to call the security guards to enforce it? (Spock goes and lies on his bed. McCoy leaves. Spock gets up again and returns to his study of the symbols.)#
MCCOY: I prescribed sleep.#
MCCOY: Musical notes? You mean it's nothing but a song?#
MCCOY: Were you able to make sense our of the symbols?#
MCCOY: I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy.#
MCCOY: That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries. The Preservers put an asteroid deflector on the planet.#
MCCOY: And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working order, otherwise#
MCCOY: I need Nurse Chapel.#
MCCOY: Wife?#
MCCOY: His brain is unimpaired. Everything else is functionally normally except his memory.#
MCCOY: It'd take time.#
MCCOY: We have no choice.#
MCCOY: What is it?#
MCCOY: She had bad internal injuries, Jim.#
MCCOY: No.#
MCCOY: Jim, you ordered us? You had no authority!#
MCCOY: Jim!#
MCCOY: McCoy here.#
MCCOY: I don't make house calls.#
MCCOY: He'll recover, but he'll need further attention. Inform your superior.#
MCCOY: McCoy. Chief medical officer.#
MCCOY: Well, you can see for yourself, he's mentally depressed, physically weak, disoriented, displays feelings of persecution and rebellion.#
MCCOY: No, not now.#
MCCOY: Yes, it's possible.#
MCCOY: Spock, I don't believe it. There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out.#
MCCOY: What do you mean, the matter's not open for discussion?#
MCCOY: What did you do? What did you do?#
MCCOY: Your instincts are still good, Mister Spock. The captain is dead.#
MCCOY: I left orders that no one come in here.#
MCCOY: Well now that you know it, you might as well assist me. Hand me the physiostimulator.#
MCCOY: Spock gave him a nerve pinch to simulate death.#
MCCOY: I didn't know it until I beamed aboard the Romulan ship. Jim and Spock were operating under Federation orders.#
MCCOY: That's the Vulcan death grip for you.#
MCCOY: You took a big chance they didn't start an autopsy.#
MCCOY: So that if anything went wrong, you would be the one to blame.#
MCCOY: What for?#
MCCOY: You have to. It's urgent.#
MCCOY: Well, I do. Mister Scott, please.#
MCCOY: What the devil is Spock doing? What's delaying him?#
MCCOY: You're taking an awful chance, Jim.#
MCCOY: Well, if all the shouting's over up there, I'd like for you to report to Sickbay.#
MCCOY: Well, are you coming, Jim?#
MCCOY: He's dead, Captain.#
MCCOY: Cyalodin.#
MCCOY: No, Jim. No indication of any kind.#
MCCOY: They seem completely secure and unafraid.#
MCCOY: I don't insist, Jim, but I can't dismiss the possibility.#
MCCOY: What those children saw is incredible, Jim. The way those deaths occurred, any reaction is possible including lacunar amnesia. That's my diagnosis. Until specific tests can be made, it remains that.#
MCCOY: Not until the fabric of the traumatisation weakens or you come up with another explanation for their behaviour. Forcing them to see this experience now could cause permanent damage.#
MCCOY: Come on. It's time to be going.#
MCCOY: The tests show no evidence of tensions due to lying. They behave as though nothing had gone wrong. They check out sound physically. There are no signs of any foreign biochemical substances to account for their present state. I have no answers, Jim.#
MCCOY: Well, can't it wait till we get to a Starbase hospital so they can be checked out by child specialists?#
MCCOY: Well, I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children if you do.#
MCCOY: Be careful.#
MCCOY: Or by misleading the innocent.#
MCCOY: Do you mean the children may be involved?#
MCCOY: I think I read you, Jim, but as medical officer I must warn you that unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children, you are treading dangerously.#
MCCOY: They're crying, Jim. I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see.#
MCCOY: Yes. It's all right. We can help them now.#
MCCOY: You'd better come down to Sickbay#
MCCOY: Now.#
MCCOY: Thank God.#
MCCOY: No, not like this.#
MCCOY: I don't know.#
MCCOY: He was worse than dead.#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: His brain is gone.#
MCCOY: It's been removed surgically.#
MCCOY: It's the greatest technical job I've ever seen. Every nerve ending in the brain must've been neatly sealed. Nothing ripped, nothing torn, no bleeding. It's a medical miracle.#
MCCOY: No. That incredible Vulcan physique hung on until the life-support cycle took over. His body lives. The autonomic functions continue. But there is no mind.#
MCCOY: What girl?#
MCCOY: I can't give you any guarantee.#
MCCOY: If it happened to any of us, I'd say indefinitely. But Vulcan physiology limits what I can do. Spock's body is more dependent on that tremendous brain for life support.#
MCCOY: Take him? Take him where?#
MCCOY: Jim, where are you going to look? In this whole galaxy, where are you going to look for Spock's brain? How are you going to find it?#
MCCOY: Even if you do, I can't restore it. I don't have the medical technique.#
MCCOY: But I don't know how.#
MCCOY: If you don't find it in twenty four hours, you'd better forget the whole thing, Jim.#
MCCOY: Call Chekov and tell him to send my stomach down.#
MCCOY: I'll have her talking in a minute.#
MCCOY: She's not, Jim. No change in reading. She doesn't know.#
MCCOY: Jim, it's no use. You'll get nothing out of that one. Hers is the mind of a child.#
MCCOY: Where are you, Spock?#
MCCOY: Where else would I be?#
MCCOY: Jim, she may not remember or even really know. Disassociation could be complete. It doesn't seem possible she could have performed surgery on Spock.#
MCCOY: Yes, for instance, above it's cold and harsh. And below, it's warm. The air is fresh.#
MCCOY: Who are the doctors? Who operates?#
MCCOY: We just want to talk to somebody about Spock's brain. That's all.#
MCCOY: Yes. Yes, in a way it is. The human brain controls the individual's functions.#
MCCOY: It's not possible.#
MCCOY: I wouldn't believe the human organism could take such pain.#
MCCOY: I'm sure you noticed the delight aspect of this place.#
MCCOY: It does, Captain.#
MCCOY: You are a disembodied brain.#
MCCOY: Thank you.#
MCCOY: I told him.#
MCCOY: Jim.. Spock. No pain. (Kirk manages to get to the control box that McCoy dropped and get Spock's body to walk over to Kara.)#
MCCOY: She couldn't, Jim. Her mind is functioning on a very simple level. Mental faculties here seem to be almost atrophied because of non-use.#
MCCOY: Without you there could be no delicate miracle that kept Spock's brain alive.#
MCCOY: Yes. From the very first, I appreciated your ability.#
MCCOY: It would be just enough time.#
MCCOY: Jim, it worked for her. It might work for me.#
MCCOY: I'm a surgeon already. If I could learn these techniques, I might be able to retain them.#
MCCOY: He might, but we're sure to lose you if I don't try.#
MCCOY: Spock, didn't you hear? I might be able to retain and bring these techniques to the world. Jim, isn't it worth that risk? Wouldn't you insist upon taking such a risk yourself?#
MCCOY: Of course. Of course. A child could do it. A child could do it. Captain's log, Stardate 5432.3. Doctor McCoy is proceeding to restore Spock's brain. Our problem, we do not know how long his increased surgical knowledge will stay with him. Any additional attempt to use the teaching device is impossible. It would kill my medical officer.#
MCCOY: I can't. I#
MCCOY: All the ganglia, the nerves. There are a million of them. What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do?#
MCCOY: I'm trying to thread a needle with a sledgehammer. What am I supposed to do? I can't remember. I don't remember.#
MCCOY: No one can restore a brain.#
MCCOY: He's dying, and I can't stop it.#
MCCOY: Spock?#
MCCOY: Speech centre.#
MCCOY: Sonic separator.#
MCCOY: Tri-laser connector. Ready?#
MCCOY: Right forefinger.#
MCCOY: Right wrist.#
MCCOY: Right elbow.#
MCCOY: I'll never live this down. This Vulcan is telling me how to operate.#
MCCOY: Closed.#
MCCOY: How do I know? I could have made a thousand mistakes. Sealing nerve endings, joining ganglia. The fluid balance is correct, but I don't know.#
MCCOY: I knew it was wrong. I shouldn't have done it.#
MCCOY: I should have never reconnected his mouth.#
MCCOY: You poor girl.#
MCCOY: Vulcan is not my idea of fun.#
MCCOY: I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be. Isn't it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad? Why do you do it?#
MCCOY: How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness the rest of her life? Will we allow it, gentlemen?#
MCCOY: To whatever you want the most, Miranda.#
MCCOY: Are you sure you're well enough to find your way alone?#
MCCOY: Now, where I come from, that's what we call a lady.#
MCCOY: Well, she's not just another girl, Captain. Don't make that mistake.#
MCCOY: I don't know what it is, exactly. She seems very vulnerable.#
MCCOY: Of course. But there's something so very disturbing about her.#
MCCOY: Good night, Jim.#
MCCOY: He's dead, Jim. Captain's log, stardate 5630.8. As a result of Larry Marvick's insane fears, the Enterprise lies derelict in uncharted space. We have no way to determine our position in relation to the galaxy. We are in a completely unknown void.#
MCCOY: I have the autopsy report on Marvick. Heart action stopped, cause unknown. Respiration stopped, cause unknown. Brain activity stopped, cause. Shall I go on?#
MCCOY: I mean he evidently could not live with what he saw.#
MCCOY: I don't think she'll want anyone to intrude in the kind of rapport she has with Kollos.#
MCCOY: Now wait a minute. I realise that you can do almost anything a sighted person can do, but you can't pilot a starship.#
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Miranda, but you must be realistic. You are blind, and there are some things you simply cannot do.#
MCCOY: Please. Do not fight us like this, Doctor Jones. I appeal to you as a colleague. Do not oppose us.#
MCCOY: She would have told you herself if she had wanted you to know. I respect her privacy.#
MCCOY: That's not Spock.#
MCCOY: That's Spock!#
MCCOY: But, Jim.#
MCCOY: He's hardly breathing. Help me get him to Sickbay.#
MCCOY: Unless Miranda can look down into his mind and turn it outward to us, we will lose Spock.#
MCCOY: Her knowledge of them may be the only thing that could save Spock's sanity, perhaps even his life.#
MCCOY: There's nothing else to be done.#
MCCOY: That's different. Marvick loved her.#
MCCOY: But they weren't rivals in love. Jim, you shouldn't go in there.#
MCCOY: What'd you say to her?#
MCCOY: What's she doing in there?#
MCCOY: You look like you've paid a visit to the devil himself.#
MCCOY: You have what you wanted most.#
MCCOY: Well, I'm truly sorry that you're leaving. Goodbye.#
MCCOY: What happened to them?#
MCCOY: That's a nasty cut, Jim. Does it hurt?#
MCCOY: She seems harmless enough.#
MCCOY: She's a mute, Jim. No vocal cords, not even vestigals. And I don't think it's a pathological condition.#
MCCOY: She appears to be perfectly healthy. As for the other, her lack of vocal cords could be physiologically normal for her species, whatever that is.#
MCCOY: That's my observation, for whatever it's worth.#
MCCOY: We can't keep referring to her as she, as if she weren't here.#
MCCOY: Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to call her Gem.#
MCCOY: Well, that's better than 'Hey, you.'#
MCCOY: Don't fight the force field. There's something about it that upsets the body metabolism.#
MCCOY: Do you feel all right, Jim?#
MCCOY: The wound is completely healed. It fits, Jim. She must be an empath. Her nervous system is so sensitive, highly responsive that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions. They become part of her.#
MCCOY: Look at this stuff.#
MCCOY: Jim, Spock.#
MCCOY: We've seen the results of some of your tests.#
MCCOY: Hey, Jim, look. Scotty and a search party.#
MCCOY: Scotty!#
MCCOY: We're coming! (When Gem stumbles again, Kirk sees the aliens watching their progress. He sends her on ahead of him.)#
MCCOY: Where'd they go?#
MCCOY: Where's Kirk?#
MCCOY: Jim.#
MCCOY: You can't go back there. You'll end up like the other two.#
MCCOY: But, Captain#
MCCOY: Come on, Spock, the passageway was there before. It's got to be there.#
MCCOY: Captain!  Jim, what is it? What have they done to you?#
MCCOY: Help him. Don't be afraid to help him. (She does, taking the pain from his shoulders and the wounds from his wrists. Gem collapses. The forcefield is gone.) MCCOY: Jim. You lie still. I'll check her out right away.#
MCCOY: She seems fine now.#
MCCOY: Complete empathy. She must be a totally functional empath. Her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms and with her strength, she virtually sustained your body's physiological reactions.#
MCCOY: It's impossible to say yet, but supplying your body with life support did drain her.#
MCCOY: That's true. Fear would naturally be her first reaction. Perhaps she doesn't know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him.#
MCCOY: Oh yes. However, I'd assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it. How do you feel?#
MCCOY: Take it easy.#
MCCOY: You have all the symptoms of the bends. Nitrogen bubbles in your blood caused the pain. Now how would one get the bends down here?#
MCCOY: Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber. But otherwise, I'd say your recovery is about miraculous. I wish I could take the credit for it, but she did the work.#
MCCOY: Spock, why do you have to get so analytical at a time like#
MCCOY: Spock, It won't be long before the Vians come back. You better find out how that thing works and soon.#
MCCOY: Men weren't intended to live this far underground. It's just not natural.#
MCCOY: I'm a doctor, not a coal miner.#
MCCOY: I'm not a mechanic. I couldn't get that thing to work no matter how many notes you left.#
MCCOY: In any case, Spock, you're the logical one to leave with the captain.#
MCCOY: I'm still Chief Medical Officer of the Enterprise. I'll tell you what you need and when you need it. Would you rather have the bends? That's it. Just lie down and relax.#
MCCOY: Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in pretty bad shape.#
MCCOY: How?#
MCCOY: You mean, if I hadn't given him that shot#
MCCOY: Not this time, Spock.#
MCCOY: The choice has been made.  You stay here with my friends. They'll take care of you. Do you understand?#
MCCOY: Get on with it.#
MCCOY: I#
MCCOY: He's right, Jim. Being a doctor has its drawbacks. I always wondered why I  Thanks.#
MCCOY: The correct medical phrase, ay, Spock? You've got a a good bedside manner, Spock.#
MCCOY: Don't touch me. Stay away. Jim. Spock. Are you here?#
MCCOY: Don't let her touch me. She'll die. Jim, I can't destroy life, even if it's to save my own. I can't. You know that. I can't let you do it.#
MCCOY: I'm with you, Captain. She awed me.#
MCCOY: Well, personally, I find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances, that it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most.#
MCCOY: Jim. The Captain's neck is broken.#
MCCOY: McCoy here.#
MCCOY: You heard correctly, Jim. These people killed each other.#
MCCOY: The best I can do is get all the readings I can get and analyse them later.#
MCCOY: What the devil?#
MCCOY: Jim, this ship is dissolving. My hand just passed through a man#
MCCOY: What happened, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before this?#
MCCOY: Did he seem to be getting hysterical?#
MCCOY: Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint.#
MCCOY: That's what I was afraid of. Whatever it was that drove the crew of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable.#
MCCOY: Time. By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant.#
MCCOY: How long will that take?#
MCCOY: Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive?#
MCCOY: If we could only find the proper filtering agent, we might be able to solve this problem. Negative. It's the third failure.#
MCCOY: Nurse, take this sample and run an analysis on it.#
MCCOY: Thank you, nurse. Call security. I want to have some checks run on this man.#
MCCOY: Has the Captain been beamed aboard yet?#
MCCOY: When is that interphase going to happen?#
MCCOY: I thought you had the thing timed out.#
MCCOY: You mean you don't know whether you're going to be able to recover the Captain or not?#
MCCOY: You can't wait for the next one. We've had another case like Chekov.#
MCCOY: The disease is not transmitted by the men, Mister Spock. The cause is the area of space we're in. It's affecting the whole crew.#
MCCOY: And the madness that affected the Defiant's crew will soon happen to the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: What's the use of this battle, Spock? You've lost Jim. Take this ship out of here.#
MCCOY: Are you satisfied? Spock, why did you do it?#
MCCOY: You should've known what could've happened and done everything in your power to safeguard your crew. That is the mark of a starship Captain, like Jim.#
MCCOY: It's still negative, Mister Spock. Theragen is the most promising substance tested so far. We're progressing.#
MCCOY: My staff is working around the clock. My being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests. This service requires my personal attention, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Take him to Sickbay. Put him in restraint.#
MCCOY: There is a duty to be performed in the Captain's quarters, which requires our presence.#
MCCOY: The Captain left a message tape. It was his order that it be reviewed by both of us, should he ever be declared dead. You have just declared Jim dead.#
MCCOY: Why? Are you afraid it'll change your present status?#
MCCOY: The Captain's last order is top priority, and you will honour that order before you take over.#
MCCOY:  He was a hero in every sense of the word, yet his life was sacrificed for nothing. The one thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the Enterprise. Now you've made that impossible, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Maybe not the same one. I really came here to find out why you stayed and fought.#
MCCOY: Yes, he would, Mister Spock, but you didn't have that decision to make. What would you gain by fighting the Tholians? You could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area. But you chose to stay. Why?#
MCCOY: You mean to be sure if he was dead. Well, you made certain of that.#
MCCOY: Yes, I have something to do. If this crew is to survive, I have to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into.#
MCCOY: There's no hurry, Mister Spock. The antidote probably doesn't concern you. Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time.#
MCCOY: I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't believe that you would want Jim's command. You must know that if you get us out of this situation, they'll pin a medal on your chest and give you command of the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: I would like to remedy that situation.#
MCCOY: Spock, I, er, I'm sorry. It does hurt, doesn't it?#
MCCOY: Of course you have, Uhura. We would all like to#
MCCOY: Of course.#
MCCOY: We're going to Sickbay.#
MCCOY: Yes, Nurse.#
MCCOY: Yes, it's beginning to spread generally throughout the ship.#
MCCOY: No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's the answer. And it better be the next one.#
MCCOY: Well, nobody saw him but you, Uhura.#
MCCOY: I don't think so.#
MCCOY: No, no. We're working hard. We'll find an antidote.#
MCCOY: Sounds like a horror story. Suppose there's any truth in it?#
MCCOY: Do you suppose they're seeing Jim because they've lost confidence in you?#
MCCOY: It's getting critical. There have been a number of assaults down on the lower decks. Even Scotty's being affected. If Scotty goes under, that's the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the Enterprise out of here.#
MCCOY: Spock! It must be this space. It's getting to me too. I know it's nothing you've done, Spock. I, I'm sorry.#
MCCOY: Yes, Uhura, you're fine. UHURA; Then what I saw MCCOY: It was real.#
MCCOY: We all saw him. The Captain's still alive.#
MCCOY: McCoy here.#
MCCOY: I'll be right there.#
MCCOY: Compliments of the house. To your good health and the health of the crew.#
MCCOY: Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone aboard the ship. I would like for you gentlemen to drink it down.#
MCCOY: He's his smiling self again. I've discharged him from Sickbay.#
MCCOY: It's a diluted theragen derivative.#
MCCOY: That's right, and in this derivative, mixed with alcohol, it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain.#
MCCOY: One good slug of this, and you can hit a man with phaser stun, and he'd never feel it or even know it.#
MCCOY: It should.#
MCCOY: Well, drink it down, Spock. It's the human thing to do. That's a medical order, Captain.#
MCCOY: McCoy here.#
MCCOY: I'm ready, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Welcome home, Jim.#
MCCOY: Oh, we managed. Mister Spock gave the orders, and I found the answers.#
MCCOY: He means when humans become involved with Vulcans, Jim.#
MCCOY: What orders are you referring to, Jim?#
MCCOY: Oh, those orders. Well, there wasn't time. We never had a chance to listen to them.#
MCCOY: You're excused. You may return to your quarters.#
MCCOY: I said you were excused, Nurse. Please, Christine. I promise you I'll give the Captain a full report.#
MCCOY: I've just completed the standard physical examinations for the entire crew.#
MCCOY: The crew is fit. I found nothing unusual, with one exception.#
MCCOY: Terminal.#
MCCOY: Xenopolycythemia. It has no cure.#
MCCOY: He has one year to live.#
MCCOY: The ship's Chief Medical Officer.#
MCCOY: I'll be most effective on the job in the time left, if you'll keep this to yourself. Captain's log, stardate 5476.3. I have just had the sad duty of informing Starfleet about Doctor McCoy's condition and have requested an immediate replacement.#
MCCOY: Without me, Jim? You'd never find your way back. KIRK; Well, I think it would be wiser if MCCOY: I'd like to go. I'm fine, Captain.#
MCCOY: You'd swear you were on the surface of a planet.#
MCCOY: You found no intelligent life forms, Mister Spock, but surely#
MCCOY: I think so.#
MCCOY: She called this the world. These people don't know they're on a spaceship.#
MCCOY: I'm all right. Are you all right, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: Oh, that Oracle really got to me. I must be especially susceptible to its magic spells.#
MCCOY: Well, we'd better get to the control room.#
MCCOY: Don't worry. I can make it, Jim.#
MCCOY: Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor. (A silver-haired old man in purple and orange looks around nervously before bowing then taking a bottle from his cummerbund. He hands out tablets.)#
MCCOY: It tastes like an ancient herb derivative.#
MCCOY: There's something under the skin.  He's dead.#
MCCOY: Oh, no. I'm quite all right, thank you.#
MCCOY: Well, now. Nobody can blame her for that, can they?#
MCCOY: Perhaps not.#
MCCOY: You are very kind.#
MCCOY: No, thank you.#
MCCOY: I'm curious. How did the Oracle punish the old man?#
MCCOY: There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there?#
MCCOY: It's all right. I suppose we had to learn the power of the Oracle.#
MCCOY: Honesty is usually wise.#
MCCOY: No, there isn't.#
MCCOY: Oh, yes. Yes, I do.#
MCCOY: We do.#
MCCOY: But we're strangers to each other.#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: How long will it take you to reach this new world?#
MCCOY: If you only knew how I needed some kind of future, Natira.#
MCCOY: Yes, very lonely.#
MCCOY: There's something I need to tell you.#
MCCOY: But there is.#
MCCOY: I have an illness for which there is no cure. I have one year to live.#
MCCOY: What are you going to do to my friends?#
MCCOY: And the punishment is death?#
MCCOY: They acted out of ignorance, Natira.#
MCCOY: Please let them return to the ship.#
MCCOY: For me? I've made my decision. I'm staying here, on Yonada. Natira, what they did, they did because they felt they had to. Please, let them return to the ship. You won't regret it. How do you think I'd feel if I stayed here with the chance to be happy for the first time in my life, but knowing my friends had died?#
MCCOY: No, I'm not.#
MCCOY: I'm on a kind of a collision course myself, Jim.#
MCCOY: And I refuse.#
MCCOY: I intend to stay on this ship, with these people, whatever happens.#
MCCOY: Is it, Mister Spock? Is it really? Natira's asked me to stay, and I'm staying.#
MCCOY: Yes. Is that too much to ask, Jim?#
MCCOY: I do.#
MCCOY: Let it be done.#
MCCOY: We're now of one mind.#
MCCOY: One life.#
MCCOY: Do the people know the contents of their book?#
MCCOY: Has the reason that the people must leave here been revealed to you?#
MCCOY: Don't you long to know its secrets?#
MCCOY: No, but I've seen the book that contains all the knowledge of the creators. And if you#
MCCOY: If you can get to it, Spock#
MCCOY: The Oracle room.#
MCCOY: They spoke the truth.#
MCCOY: She will be. I'll stay here with her. The book is in the monolith.#
MCCOY: Press the three lower planets on the left-hand side simultaneously.#
MCCOY: We'll be all right here now, Jim.#
MCCOY: The oracle can no longer punish us.#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: Then come.#
MCCOY: Don't be afraid.#
MCCOY: You intend to stay here, on Yonada?#
MCCOY: Then I won't leave you.#
MCCOY: Now more than ever, I wish to search through the universe to find a cure for myself and others like me. And I want you to be with me.#
MCCOY: Thank you, Mister Spock, for bringing back the knowledge of the Fabrini.#
MCCOY: Nothing. They said they were being attacked by an unidentified ship.#
MCCOY: Jim, you can't hand over the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: Move aside.#
MCCOY: What happened?#
MCCOY: Chekov may be right. The Klingons claim to have honoured the truce, but there have been incidents, raids on our outposts.#
MCCOY: What proof do we need? We know what a Klingon is.#
MCCOY: There. Those filthy butchers. There are rules, even in war. You don't keep hacking at a man after he's down. Hand me that numanol capsule. (There's a man with a head wound in another bed, and a security guard is brought in too.) {Science Lab] (The Klingons access ship's schematics on a desk monitor)#
MCCOY: Truce? Are you serious? I've got men in Sickbay, some of them dying. Atrocities committed on their persons, and you talk about making peace with these fiends? If our backs were turned, they'd jump us in a minute. And you know what Klingons do to prisoners. Slave labour, death planets, experiments!#
MCCOY: While you're talking, they're planning attacks. This is a fight to the death. We'd better start trying to win it!#
MCCOY: Who cares what started it, Mister Spock. We're in it! Murderers. We should wipe out every one of them!#
MCCOY: How many more men must die before you two begin to act like military men instead of fools?#
MCCOY: Brain waves show almost paranoid mania. What happened?#
MCCOY: Orderly. Jim. Johnson's heart wound is almost healed. Same with the other casualties. Sword wounds in the vital organs, massive trauma, shock. They're all healing at a fantastic rate.#
MCCOY: Gentlemen, if we are pawns, you're looking at one who is extremely sorry.#
MCCOY: Let's jump him.#
MCCOY: Yeah, out already.#
MCCOY: I am. What's the problem?#
MCCOY: Well, what happened to that leg?#
MCCOY: I don't understand. This should have been attended to immediately.#
MCCOY: Well, we're certainly going to try. The infection is massive. Let me give you a hypo to ease the pain.#
MCCOY: In the arm.#
MCCOY: I'll let you know when I have the results. And from now on, it would be better if I handled the instruments without your help.#
MCCOY: Neither do I, but it has. How do I knock out an infection when the tricorder doesn't show any information on Platonius bacteria? All I can do, and this is going to take time, is to try to match his bugs with a known strain and hope. (Alexander is playing a near life-size game like chess with two other men.)#
MCCOY: What about medicine? Why no doctors?#
MCCOY: I think I'd better wait until the fever breaks.#
MCCOY: Jim, my concoction actually worked. The fever's broken. And what recuperative powers. The infection's begun to drain already.#
MCCOY: He may still need the ship's medical stores. Why prevent contact?#
MCCOY: I don't know. I don't want to go, but I can't help myself.#
MCCOY: I'm very sorry, but that's impossible.#
MCCOY: The answer is no.#
MCCOY: I can't move, Jim. They're going to keep me here no matter what. Leave, please.#
MCCOY: You won't persuade me.#
MCCOY: Stop it! Don't do this to him, Parmen!#
MCCOY: No, Parmen! Stop it!#
MCCOY: I have my orders.#
MCCOY: And we've had too much of yours. I'll never get me to stay here.#
MCCOY: He's a Vulcan. You can't force emotion out of him.#
MCCOY: You'll destroy him.#
MCCOY: I beg you.#
MCCOY: There is no medicine that can help him. He'll have to come through this himself.#
MCCOY: The release of emotions, Mister Spock, is what keeps us healthy. Emotionally healthy, that is.#
MCCOY: Yes, Spock. And hatred.#
MCCOY: Jim. This is senseless. I've thought it over. I'm staying.#
MCCOY: Parmen has promised me you'll be safe.#
MCCOY: Why? Why trick me?#
MCCOY: Then why wouldn't Alexander have the same power as the others?#
MCCOY: You won't even know it happened.#
MCCOY: Of course. Parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability, and Alexander the lowest, in the same environmental conditions.#
MCCOY: I'll run both their blood samples through for a full comparative test on the tricorder.#
MCCOY: The one significant difference between Parmen's blood and Alexander's is a concentration of kironide, broken down by pituitary hormone.#
MCCOY: It'll take some doing, but it is possible.#
MCCOY: Even if the kironide reaches the desired effect, it still may not help us get out of here.#
MCCOY: I'm ready.#
MCCOY: Since the kironide's broken down and injected directly into his bloodstream, it should work on him as well as us. Better in fact, because he's acclimated.#
MCCOY: They'll never do it, Jim.#
MCCOY: Stop it, Parmen! Stop it! I'll do whatever you want me to do. I'll stay and serve you, but stop it!#
MCCOY: It must be a malfunction. This is a barren world. There's hardly any vegetation, no apparent animal life.#
MCCOY: My tricorder doesn't register it.#
MCCOY: Compton!#
MCCOY: Tell the captain what you told me.#
MCCOY: Lie down, Jim.#
MCCOY: All perfectly normal. Whatever happened to Compton down there apparently had no effect on anyone else.#
MCCOY: No. There's no mention of it.#
MCCOY: I'm not finished yet.#
MCCOY: What do you mean?#
MCCOY: Physically, there's nothing wrong with you.#
MCCOY: I'd say no.#
MCCOY: There's no question about it, Spock. I want you to take a look at this. The same substance is in the captain's coffee as in the Scalosian water, and there's no trace of it in any other cups.#
MCCOY: I've been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to Scalos.#
MCCOY: McCoy to Spock.#
MCCOY: I've found a tape in the computer down here, and when I try to read it, all I get is a whine.#
MCCOY: Finished.#
MCCOY: Most effectively under laboratory conditions, but the question is will it work in the human body? And the second question is, how do we get it to the captain?#
MCCOY: Spock, you don't know what that'll do to you.#
MCCOY: Just like Compton.#
MCCOY: Why? What is it, Jim?#
MCCOY: Jim, did you see what I saw?#
MCCOY: How could it be gone? What the devil does that mean, Jim?#
MCCOY: Could it be the Enterprise hit the planet?#
MCCOY: If the Enterprise has been destroyed, you know how long we can survive.#
MCCOY: Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air?#
MCCOY: Sulu's picked up an organism that's almost a virus, like a a plant parasite. It's the nearest biological form of life I can find.#
MCCOY: McCoy to Kirk.#
MCCOY: Jim, I just got a life form reading of tremendous intensity. Suddenly it was just there.#
MCCOY: Just that. All levels were normal, then I get this biological surge of life form registering. No, now it's gone.;#
MCCOY: Yes.#
MCCOY: Zero eight three.#
MCCOY: I'll be right there. (Kirk arrives first. We see a pair of legs with boots lying face down behind a rock.)#
MCCOY: Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted.#
MCCOY: Jim, what are you doing?#
MCCOY: Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point.#
MCCOY: This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered over by top soil.#
MCCOY: Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for D'Amato.#
MCCOY: I wonder what killed him.#
MCCOY: It would be worse if he had company.#
MCCOY: I'm not joking. Until we know what killed him, none of us are safe.#
MCCOY: But our instruments recorded that. They were life forms. They registered as life forms.#
MCCOY: Captain, it doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing about this planet makes sense.#
MCCOY: Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet?#
MCCOY: While it lasts.#
MCCOY: Well, all I know is she almost made a ghost out of Sulu. His shoulder, where she touched it, every cell's been disrupted. Exploded from within. If she'd really gotten a good grip on him, Jim.#
MCCOY: There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick. A normal wound would heal quickly.#
MCCOY: Jim, what kind of power must she have?#
MCCOY: Yes. Why didn't she kill you?#
MCCOY: He's in fair shape.#
MCCOY: Keep behind us, Jim.#
MCCOY: Captain, I'm getting no life form register.#
MCCOY: That would give a mechanical reading. I'm getting nothing.#
MCCOY: She's not registering.#
MCCOY: Is the power level still holding, Jim?#
MCCOY: You think we're being invited in?#
MCCOY: We've been led here. Why?#
MCCOY: Watch out!#
MCCOY: The women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us.#
MCCOY: The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people. The supply ship that she was waiting for never came. All these thousands of years, she's been waiting to greet people who were dead.#
MCCOY: And beautiful.#
MCCOY: That's what I've recorded, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: Well, I can't give you any specific circumstance that will explain him.#
MCCOY: Yes, I would agree. That's the case here.#
MCCOY: Well, I can't give you one, Jim. I've never worked on anyone like him or anything like him.#
MCCOY: When in doubt, the book prevails, Mister Spock. I've run tests. Blood is blood, even when it's green like yours. The organs are there. They're rearranged to a degree, plus a few I've never seen before. Now, I've enriched the oxygen content of his blood and pumped in a strong stimulant. And I must say his recuperative powers appear to be excellent.#
MCCOY: Well, touch and go there for a minute, but you're out of danger now.#
MCCOY: Well, however we view him, Captain, he's certainly no ordinary specimen. Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you exactly, but if I had your readings, I'd be the most incredible physical specimen of all time.#
MCCOY: Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve.#
MCCOY: Something's wrong.#
MCCOY: How can we be powerful enough to wipe out a planet and still be so helpless?#
MCCOY: It won't work, Scotty. They'd have to cover thousands of miles through poisonous atmosphere before they'd ever reach the asylum.#
MCCOY: Probably kill Jim and Spock.#
MCCOY: It must've wiped out everything.#
MCCOY: Got to break through it somehow.#
MCCOY: I know it, Scotty.#
MCCOY: Will it leave a margin of safety for the people below?#
MCCOY: Intravenous is indicated unless circumstances make it impossible.#
MCCOY: Reversal of arterial and brain damage should begin almost immediately.#
MCCOY: Well, what are we waiting for, Mister Spock? We're not diplomats.#
MCCOY: That doesn't mean we have behave like children and listen to some fool lecture by a diplomat!#
MCCOY: Well, where do we start, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: You mean you're going to scan space for him?#
MCCOY: Are you going to let him get away with that?#
MCCOY: We do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done.#
MCCOY: Just when I was beginning to think you might find a whole new career as a diplomat, Mister Spock.#
MCCOY: I don't understand how Starfleet can deny permission to beam down to search for the captain.#
MCCOY: That's the best possible decision you could make, Spock. I'm with you.#
MCCOY: Co-ordinates don't match.#
MCCOY: I'll pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the transporter room.#
MCCOY: I'm not asking you to make the decision for me.#
MCCOY: In that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make, Spock.#
MCCOY: An exact duplicate of the Enterprise? Is it in orbit, Mister Spock?#
MCCOY: Well, that's a beginning, but what about the captain?#
MCCOY: Well, that was close, but you made it.#
MCCOY: Right. Just like the captain.#
MCCOY: Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance?#
MCCOY: Well, I think she's coming around now.#
MCCOY: You let me be the judge of that. Do you feel like walking to Sickbay?#
MCCOY: Are the readings corresponding, Nurse?#
MCCOY: Thank you.#
MCCOY: Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this ship. You're the only one that passed out, and I want to know why.#
MCCOY: This whole thing is a new experience for all of us.#
MCCOY: Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that determination. Now then, tell me. What did you feel before you passed out?#
MCCOY: Nothing?#
MCCOY: Lieutenant#
MCCOY: Lieutenant, you're being completely unco-operative!#
MCCOY: I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them.#
MCCOY: Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in Starfleet requires discipline and co-operation.#
MCCOY: McCoy here, Jim.#
MCCOY: I think she's in good shape.#
MCCOY: Somehow, I find transporting into the darkness unnerving.#
MCCOY: Over here, Captain!#
MCCOY: Not a thing, Jim.  The same garbled sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm.#
MCCOY: Absolutely sure.#
MCCOY: She's dead.#
MCCOY: Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural systems, dissolution of autonomic nervous system. All basic personality factors, Captain.#
MCCOY: Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown.#
MCCOY: Yes, Captain. I can be more detailed when we return to the ship and use the ship's computers.#
MCCOY: We found one person in there just barely alive. The rest were dead, and we#
MCCOY: Go easy on her, Jim. She's in a pretty bad state.#
MCCOY: Of course you didn't. I told the Captain.#
MCCOY: Romaine, Mira. Lieutenant. Place of birth, Martian Colony Number Three. Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased. Jacques Romaine, chief engineer, Starfleet, retired.#
MCCOY: Yes, Captain.#
MCCOY: Occasional and teenage routine incidents.#
MCCOY: None.#
MCCOY: No, Captain, not empathic. However, an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked.#
MCCOY: After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a standard Steinman analysis. The results might be interesting.#
MCCOY: The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors remain exactly the same as before. However, according to two hyperencephalograms, her brain wave pattern has been altered.#
MCCOY: That's what I was taught. But the BCP is just as consistent as fingerprints.#
MCCOY: That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That might be a factor.#
MCCOY: Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine.#
MCCOY: Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be no error.#
MCCOY: There has been no error.#
MCCOY: She could kill us all in this state.#
MCCOY: The girl�s life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians. She's losing.#
MCCOY: Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might kill the girl too.#
MCCOY: The Zetars are growing stronger.#
MCCOY: The pressure is dangerously high, Captain. It may damage her.#
MCCOY: We've done it, Jim. They're gone.#
MCCOY: Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock.#
MCCOY: Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant. Try not to move at all. Take deep, regular breaths. Now, don't hold it. Continue to breathe deeply. In, out. In, out. That's it. Now, you'll be in there another twenty minutes, so why don't you just try to relax?#
MCCOY: When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous.#
MCCOY: However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I find that encouraging.#
MCCOY: There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock. It was a factor, and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery.#
MCCOY: Well, I should think work would be a better therapy.#
MCCOY: That may not be easy, Jim. Medical analysis indicates the Troglytes are mentally inferior.#
MCCOY: Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly. Their intellect ratings are almost twenty percent below average.#
MCCOY: That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines. Therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths.#
MCCOY: Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here.#
MCCOY: There are none after it�s refined. But in its raw state, it emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional. Therefore, it releases a violent reaction.#
MCCOY: That's right. And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to it.;#
MCCOY: That's right, Spock. The other Disrupters were probably removed from exposure too.#
MCCOY: According to findings, it should.#
MCCOY: No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure.#
MCCOY: There's every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary, even after repeated exposure.#
MCCOY: But that could take days.#
MCCOY: It's pretty hard to overcome prejudice.#
MCCOY: You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?#
MCCOY: Can the zenite be affecting him?#
MCCOY: Look out, Jim!#
MCCOY: Trouble. Your friend here didn't want a checkup. Turns out there's a reason.#
MCCOY: You don't have the choice.#
MCCOY: I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive planet, but assuming one did exist, I can tell you what would have happened had he settled there.#
MCCOY: There wouldn't have been enough primitives left to bury their dead.#
MCCOY: I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim. Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it. Synthococcus novae. It's deadly. We can immunise against it, but haven't learned to lick all the problems yet.#
MCCOY: All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier. Remember your ancient history? Typhoid Mary? He's immune, as she was, but he carries the disease and spreads it to others.#
MCCOY: I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before boarding. Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too. But a regular programme of shots is necessary. I'll have to check everyone on the ship. There could be some skips. In the meantime, he should be placed in total isolation.#
MCCOY: Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you?#
MCCOY: Then why did you fight the examination?#
MCCOY: Be ready for the objections, Jim. They are a vocal lot.#
MCCOY: It'll show in twenty four hours. It's a virulent strain.#
MCCOY: It's burned. All this plant life is full of acid. Even the grass, Jim.#
MCCOY: It should for a while.#
MCCOY: Poison. The fruit is deadly.#
MCCOY: He should be beamed aboard, Jim. He needs more than I can do for him here.#
MCCOY: Come back here, you fool!#
MCCOY: Don't bite into that!#
MCCOY: Jim, there's a large deposit bearing two seven three, four kilometres away. I've got four hours to process that stuff, otherwise the epidemic will be irreversible. Everybody on board the Enterprise will#
MCCOY: Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one day. The effects are like bubonic plague.#
MCCOY: Yes, a Shakespeare first folio. A Gutenberg Bible.#
MCCOY: Do we trust him?#
MCCOY: Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin.#
MCCOY: Saurian brandy, one hundred years old. Jim?#
MCCOY: Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human vice.#
MCCOY: Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once alcohol hits that green blood#
MCCOY: I'll drink to that. What emotion?#
MCCOY: Well, that could explain the paintings. Similar to the real thing.#
MCCOY: Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin.#
MCCOY: I would like to supervise that, of course.#
MCCOY: With most impressive results, sir. What else interests you besides gravity phenomena, Rayna?#
MCCOY: The totality of the universe? All knowledge?#
MCCOY: At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage, but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen.#
MCCOY: The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege.#
MCCOY: Thank you, sir.#
MCCOY: Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand.#
MCCOY: Thank you.#
MCCOY: Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in under the wire. I�ve never seen anything like the speed of that robot. It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff.#
MCCOY: Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium?#
MCCOY: Like a hawk.#
MCCOY: I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing, and the next thing I knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn.#
MCCOY: Well, I think we'd better tell Jim.#
MCCOY: Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here.#
MCCOY: Why? Get to the point, Spock, if there is one.#
MCCOY: The ryetalyn. (And over by the far wall is a covered figure with the label - Rayna 16. Kirk takes a look at it. It is a bald version of Rayna. They look further and see others. Rayna 14, Rayna 15. Captain's log, stardate 5843.8. We have accomplished our mission and have the ryetalyn ready to combat the epidemic aboard the Enterprise. But we have also discovered our benefactor's secret. He has created the perfect woman. Her only flaw, she�s not human.#
MCCOY: Physically human but not human. These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim. She's an android.#
MCCOY: Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal. You learned that you were immortal and#
MCCOY: You have been such men. You've known and created such beauty. You've watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism throughout your enormous life, and yet now you would do this to us?#
MCCOY: All emotions are in play, Mister Flint. You harm us, she hates you.#
MCCOY: Jim. Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last.#
MCCOY: Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally#
MCCOY: Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition. And who knows what he might come up with.#
MCCOY: Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can. Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle. You wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock? You see, I feel sorrier for you than I do for him because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to. The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the desperate chances, the glorious failures, the glorious victories. All of these things you'll never know simply because the word love isn't written into your book. Goodnight, Spock.#
MCCOY: I do wish he could forget her.#
MCCOY: What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet, Spock? The surface is molten lava. The atmosphere is poisonous.#
MCCOY: Well I think Starfleet should forget about those old space legends. There's no intelligent life here.#
MCCOY: Jim! (On the screen is the image of a man sitting in a large leather chair, and wearing a stove-pipe hat)#
MCCOY: Jim, do you really believe he's Abraham Lincoln?#
MCCOY: Human, Jim.#
MCCOY: Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard?#
MCCOY: And that became Lincoln?#
MCCOY: I'm not quite sure. Captain's log, stardate 5906.4. Who or what has been beamed aboard our vessel? An alien who has changed himself into this form? An illusion? I cannot conceive it possible that Abraham Lincoln could have actually been reincarnated. And yet his kindness, his gentle wisdom, his humour, everything about him is so right.#
MCCOY: Where the devil are they?#
MCCOY: Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image.#
MCCOY: Do I have to lay it out for you? Practically the entire crew has seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he can�t possibly be the real article.#
MCCOY: You're the science officer. Why aren't you, well, doing whatever a science officer does at a time like this?#
MCCOY: At last! At least somebody agrees with us he's an alien.#
MCCOY: Yes, a big one. Suddenly, miraculously, we see a small spot of Earth-type environment down there. Now is it really there, or do we just think we see it down there?#
MCCOY: Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam down there?#
MCCOY: But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim. I think it's interesting, in as much as you're the one who's going to make the decision whether to beam down or not.#
MCCOY: You're both out of your heads!#
MCCOY: Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able to patch together again?#
MCCOY: If they�re wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava#
MCCOY: Scotty.#
MCCOY: If they�re all right, they should've reported in.#
MCCOY: At least the captain and Spock are safe.#
MCCOY: Can we beam the captain and Spock back up?#
MCCOY: Well, can we send the phasers down?#
MCCOY: But they're not real, any more than that Lincoln or Surak. What do the sensors read?#
MCCOY: Could they be aliens projecting an illusion?#
MCCOY: How can a planet full of people just disappear?#
MCCOY: Well, that's fine. Where do we start?#
MCCOY: No, no particular person, just people in general. Where did they go?#
MCCOY: As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim.#
MCCOY: What is this place?#
MCCOY: What's wrong?#
MCCOY: Where's the captain, Spock? We were right behind him.#
MCCOY: Jim, can you hear us?#
MCCOY: He means it's cold.#
MCCOY: I was looking over some material about their Ice Age.#
MCCOY: Jim, what's the matter? Jim sounded like he was in trouble.#
MCCOY: Leave me here, Spock.#
MCCOY: Don't be a fool. My hands and face are frostbitten. I can't feel my feet. Alone you have a chance. Now do what I say. Go try to find Jim.#
MCCOY: You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan! (A figure wearing a full length fur coat with hood approaches, then turns to walk away. Spock helps McCoy to follow)#
MCCOY: Who are you?#
MCCOY: Zarabeth. Spock, are we in the library?#
MCCOY: Jim. What about Jim?#
MCCOY: You find him, Spock. Don't you worry about me. You just find him.#
MCCOY:  Spock? Where are we?#
MCCOY: Yes, I remember you.#
MCCOY: Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim?#
MCCOY: What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back.#
MCCOY: Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here?#
MCCOY: Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook. Have you ever been told that?#
MCCOY: Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those matters.#
MCCOY: Oh? Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct difference in our approach.#
MCCOY: No, not yet.#
MCCOY: And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license. Don't let him doctor you. I'm the doctor around here.#
MCCOY: I wonder where she is.#
MCCOY: Thank you.#
MCCOY: I wonder where Jim is.#
MCCOY: What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything about it?#
MCCOY: Locate the portal. It can't be too far.#
MCCOY: Yes, that was clear to me.#
MCCOY: I don't believe it, Spock. It�s just not like you to give up trying.#
MCCOY: Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I understand. You want to stay here. As a matter of fact, you're highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste.#
MCCOY: You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan.#
MCCOY: What's happening to you, Spock?#
MCCOY: Long ago. Of course. Long ago.#
MCCOY: Spock. You've been dishonest with me, Spock, and that is also something new for you.#
MCCOY: The facts as you know them. Or did you just accept Zarabeth's word because it's what you wanted to believe?#
MCCOY: Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness. She would do anything to anybody to change that. Wouldn't you, Zarabeth?#
MCCOY: Did you? You said we can't get back. The truth is you can't get back.#
MCCOY: She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She would lie. She would cheat. She would even murder me, the captain, the entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her. Go ahead, Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth. Go ahead. Tell Spock you would kill!#
MCCOY: Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want? Think. What are you feeling? Rage? Jealousy? Have you ever had those feelings before?#
MCCOY: The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years. Think, man. What's happening on your planet right now, this very moment?#
MCCOY: Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock, you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you were born!#
MCCOY: I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there, and I want that life. (So McCoy heads off through the arctic winds, with just a fur shawl for protection)#
MCCOY: I suppose you're right.#
MCCOY: It�s Jim! Here we are, Jim.#
MCCOY: Come on, Spock.#
MCCOY: Come on, Spock, now!#
MCCOY: Something's wrong.#
MCCOY: But it did happen, Spock.#
MCCOY: What form of radiation was it?#
MCCOY: Perhaps your presence will quiet her.#
MCCOY: We were too late, Jim. There's nothing could be done.#
MCCOY: No, I believe it was celebium. However, Doctor Coleman disagrees. To be specific is essential because the treatment of celebium is quite#
MCCOY: Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone?#
MCCOY: Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than waiting.#
MCCOY: No, not entirely. We both agree it's radiation. Doctor Coleman isn't prepared to say what form of radiation.#
MCCOY: It's crucial.#
MCCOY: Oh? I didn't know you knew her that well.#
MCCOY: Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim.#
MCCOY: I didn't realise that. I shall do everything in my power.#
MCCOY: Jim, what are you doing here?#
MCCOY: Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage, Doctor Coleman.#
MCCOY: Doctor Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as the symptoms I can detect, Jim.#
MCCOY: You can't do this! On this ship my medical authority is final!#
MCCOY: I won't allow it.#
MCCOY: It's not necessary, Jim. Can't you see she's coming around? (Janice opens her eyes, sees Kirk and has flashbacks to the transferal, just to remind us who is really who)#
MCCOY: A sedative is not wise at this time, Captain.#
MCCOY: Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions.#
MCCOY: I'll let my record speak for me.#
MCCOY: That is not the reason I'm here. I'm here because Doctor Coleman's record states that he's incompetent.#
MCCOY: No, sir. That is the opinion of Starfleet Command. I checked with them. Doctor Coleman was removed from his post as Chief Medical Officer of his ship for administrative incompetence.#
MCCOY: As well as flagrant medical blunders.#
MCCOY: Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain. And certainly not in the Surgeon General's office.#
MCCOY: I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make. I also find myself in that position now, Jim, and I'm asking you to report for an examination.#
MCCOY: Development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet.#
MCCOY: I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives.#
MCCOY: But you will submit to Starfleet regulations, and they state that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crew member that he has doubts about, including the captain.#
MCCOY: These tests should help me pinpoint the cause of Jim�s illness.#
MCCOY: Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him. We've got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin.#
MCCOY: One of us should be able to get to him. I keep looking for an approach, but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult.#
MCCOY: You know headquarters, Spock. They're only interested in results of specific tests. So far all we have to offer are our opinions.#
MCCOY: I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary.#
MCCOY: Well, then, so be it. Our responsibility is clear.#
MCCOY: Well, it's worth a try. Why don't you try to get to Doctor Lester while I examine Jim.#
MCCOY: Jim!#
MCCOY: Captain.#
MCCOY: That's enough. That's enough. Your heart will last forever, Captain.#
MCCOY: In the pink, as usual. Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic rate. Everything, even your glands, functioning at their usual, normal peak of efficiency.#
MCCOY: Don't get dressed yet.#
MCCOY: Physically.#
MCCOY: The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial. It reveals the basic emotional structure. You had one once before. Now I need another one to compare with that previous test. There should be no change in your dermal-optic reactions to the colour wavelengths. Over here, Captain. Over here, Captain.#
MCCOY: Now lower your arms and open your eyes.#
MCCOY: There is no positive evidence of any disorder.#
MCCOY: I'm sure everything's going to be all right.#
MCCOY: Examining you.#
MCCOY: Yes, that's correct.#
MCCOY: The captain is in the best of physical condition. His emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the Enterprise.#
MCCOY: Scotty.#
MCCOY: I've been through this with Spock. He's not being scientific and neither are you.#
MCCOY: Don't you think I know that? My tests show there's nothing wrong with the captain. Now that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be interested in.#
MCCOY: I don't know.#
MCCOY: We don't know that.#
MCCOY: We're talking about mutiny, Scotty.#
MCCOY: Yes. I'm ready for the vote.#
MCCOY: That's enough. We know what was said.#
MCCOY: Then it's possible the transference can be broken.#
MCCOY: Of course. Come with me.#
