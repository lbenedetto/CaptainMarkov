HOSHI: Very good. Ghlungit !tak nekleet.#
HOSHI: Carlos. Ltrunghi !krgltt!#
HOSHI: !krgltt!#
HOSHI: Tighten the back of your tongue. !krgltt!#
HOSHI: Keep trying. You've almost got it.  I'll be right back.#
HOSHI: There's two more weeks before exams. It's impossible for me to leave now.#
HOSHI: If there was anyone else who could do what I do, you wouldn't be so eager to have me on your space ship.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, Captain. I owe it to these kids.#
HOSHI: I'm on leave from Starfleet, remember? You would have to forcibly recall me, which would require a reprimand which would disqualify me from serving on an active vessel.#
HOSHI: And you'll have her in three weeks. What's that?#
HOSHI: I thought you said the Vulcans were opposed to this.#
HOSHI: What do you know about these Klingons?#
HOSHI: Turn it up.#
HOSHI: I don't know. Does anybody else feel that?#
HOSHI: Those vibrations, like little tremors.#
HOSHI: There! What do you call that?#
HOSHI: Ponfo mirann.#
HOSHI: The translator. It's not locking onto his dialect. The syntax won't align.#
HOSHI: Ingan Hoch juH.#
HOSHI: He wants to know who we are. Ou'ghewme Enterpise. PugloD.#
HOSHI: LupHom. Ship. He's asking for his ship back.#
HOSHI: SonchI.#
HOSHI: I'm not sure, but I think he's saying something about eating the afterlife?#
HOSHI: I'm going to need to run what we've got through the phonetic processor.#
HOSHI: He says his wife has grown ugly? I'm sorry, Captain. I'm doing the best I can.#
HOSHI: I think the Doctor's right, Captain, unless stinky boots has something to do with all this.#
HOSHI: That's the warp reactor again, right?#
HOSHI: Shut up!#
HOSHI: Captain! There's someone here. (All use flashlights to check around until Archer spots one on the ceiling.)#
HOSHI: Those weren't glitches in Sickbay.#
HOSHI: Right away.#
HOSHI: Are you sure it's safe to stand so close to that?#
HOSHI: I've managed to translate most of what Klaang said, but none of it makes sense.#
HOSHI: Nope.#
HOSHI: The word's not even in their database. It's all there. There were only four words I couldn't translate. probably just proper nouns.#
HOSHI: It's all right. Rigelian uses a pronominal base. The translator's just reprocessing the syntax.#
HOSHI: Isn't an enclave supposed to have people?#
HOSHI: T'Pol said something about live food. I don't see any restaurants.#
HOSHI: Ha'quj jeg! They looked Klingon to me.#
HOSHI: Maybe we should get back to where there are more people.#
HOSHI: Where's the pod?#
HOSHI: Great!#
HOSHI: I think I have frostbite.#
HOSHI: I never had to worry about frostbite in Brazil.#
HOSHI: Sensor resolution's falling off at about twelve kilometres.#
HOSHI: You might think about recommending seat belts when we get home.#
HOSHI: We've got sensors.#
HOSHI: Over three thousand, but I can't isolate a Klingon. If there is one.#
HOSHI: There, right there. These bio-readings are not Suliban.#
HOSHI:  Grab on to something.#
HOSHI: Wait a minute, I think I've got something.#
HOSHI: It's Commander Tucker.#
HOSHI: It's just a narrow notch in the mid-range. He says he's about to ignite his thruster exhaust.#
HOSHI: You're welcome.#
HOSHI: I'm only picking up two bio-signs. One Klingon, one human. (Archer follows some strange readings and finds himself at the end of a corridor. A door closes behind him, there's strobing lights then a door in front opens. As he walks in, he notices there's a echo effect with his movements)#
HOSHI: Something about disgracing the Empire. He says he's ready to die.#
HOSHI: I don't think they have a word for thank you.#
HOSHI: You don't want to know.#
HOSHI: Probably not humanoids?#
HOSHI: Wish I did. She doesn't look any better, does she.#
HOSHI: I should have left her where I found her.#
HOSHI: She wasn't meant to be in this environment.#
HOSHI: He's going to make you all better.#
HOSHI: Doctor Phlox thinks this argon lamp should help. She's barely moved all day.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry.#
HOSHI: No, sir, but the Doctor's doing the best he can. Sir, my quarters are on E deck, starboard section five.#
HOSHI: The stars are going the wrong way, sir.#
HOSHI: On both my training tours, I had port side quarters. I'm having trouble sleeping.#
HOSHI: The wrong side of the ship, yes, sir. I spoke with Ensign Porter. He said he's be willing to switch, with your permission.#
HOSHI: I appreciate it, Captain.#
HOSHI: No, sir. Thank you.#
HOSHI: No, sir.#
HOSHI: I'll try it again. No response, sir.#
HOSHI: She may have a point, Captain. I could try hailing them on theta-band frequencies.#
HOSHI: Me, sir?#
HOSHI: Sorry to bother you, sir.#
HOSHI: No, thank you.#
HOSHI: Sir?#
HOSHI: Yes, that's fine, thank you. I was thinking, Captain, I might be a lot more helpful to you if I stay here and keep an open comm. link. That way I'll have immediate access to the linguistic database.#
HOSHI: It's not the same. The lag time is tripled.#
HOSHI: The environmental suits. They make me a little claustrophobic.#
HOSHI: You talked me into it, remember.#
HOSHI: Well, I just, I bit my lip and got through it.#
HOSHI: Yes, sir.#
HOSHI: No, I'd better get back to the Launch Bay.#
HOSHI: I've been cleared on EM sidearms and class three pulse rifles. I've never seen one of those.#
HOSHI: Is this necessary?#
HOSHI: Enterprise, we've got access. We're boarding the vessel.#
HOSHI: Well, at least we know they're bipeds.#
HOSHI: The ladder.#
HOSHI: There's power going through here, but not much of it.#
HOSHI: Blood?#
HOSHI: These icons look like they represent frequency bands.#
HOSHI: If it is, it's offline. Maybe that's why they didn't answer our hails.#
HOSHI: And what's this?#
HOSHI: I don't think you need a translator.#
HOSHI: I screamed like a twelve year old.#
HOSHI: Nobody else screamed.  Has she been eating?#
HOSHI: I'm a translator. I didn't come out here to see corpses hanging on hooks.#
HOSHI: Not corpses on hooks.#
HOSHI: I'm an exo-linguist. I graduated second in my class. I spent three years in Starfleet training. I was Jonathan Archer's first choice for this mission. Every inhabited world we come to is going to be filled with language. Some will have hundreds of them. He needs me here.#
HOSHI: Are you sure that's what she eats?#
HOSHI: I shouldn't have brought her on board. Maybe I could ask the Captain to try to find a planet with an argon rich atmosphere.#
HOSHI: She needs to get back to an environment that is more suited to her.#
HOSHI: Captain.#
HOSHI: Maybe it's a log. What do you think?#
HOSHI: The grammar sounds bimodal.#
HOSHI: Let's hope.  Ship. Ship.#
HOSHI: How long before the transceiver's online?#
HOSHI: The quicker we get this done, the quicker we can get back to the ship.#
HOSHI: Yeah, great.#
HOSHI: Distress. Two other teachers and I once took a hydro-skimmer out onto a small tributary in the Amazon. You know, to see the wildlife. Sloths, pink dolphins, all kinds of snakes.#
HOSHI: It gave me the creeps. If I didn't like being around anacondas, you can imagine how I feel about Suliban or whoever butchered the crew of this ship. I'm going to ask the Captain to take me home.#
HOSHI: I should have never left the university. I'm not suited for this.#
HOSHI: You weren't here yesterday. I saw those bodies and fell apart. The Captain needs a translator he can count on. Someone who shows a little grace under pressure. That isn't me.#
HOSHI: Oh yes I can. Distress. Distress.#
HOSHI: I think I've got it. Ship in distress.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: I told him what you said, sir, but I doubt it made any sense.#
HOSHI: This isn't exactly Spanish we're dealing with here. I'd be lucky if I'm getting half the vocabulary right.#
HOSHI: It seems he got the part about killing the cargo ship crew but he believes we did it, sir. At least I think he does.#
HOSHI: I think I understood this one. He says the distress call came from his ship, not ours.#
HOSHI: Something about DNA scans. He wants to know why we were there two years ago.#
HOSHI: He probably means two days, sir. The phonetic processor's still having trouble locking on. I'm not certain, but I don't think he's going to help us.#
HOSHI: I'm having trouble with the word pump, sir. I've got the processor searching for synonyms. The translator's not making a whole lot of sense to him, sir. He's getting frustrated. I think he's running out of patience, Captain.#
HOSHI: Do what myself?#
HOSHI: That's impossible, sir. I haven't even learned their basic conjugations.#
HOSHI: You don't understand. I don't even know how to say pump. I'll get it all wrong, it'll just make things worse.#
HOSHI: Sir.#
HOSHI:  Uta doi ura.#
HOSHI: Uta lora ista. Urasta mistavor.#
HOSHI: This isn't exactly like the place you came from, but it's close enough. It's not that hard to adapt. You're going to do just fine here.#
HOSHI: Suitable for humanoid life.#
HOSHI: Not good. His biosigns are very erratic.#
HOSHI: Enterprise to Novakovich.#
HOSHI: She says Trip's going to kill her, and I don't think she's imagining it.#
HOSHI:  The winds.#
HOSHI:  T'Pol replies in Vulcan, whilst beginning to sweat herself.)HOSHI: She says play-acting isn't exactly a Vulcan tradition, but she'll do her best.(T'Pol calls out in Vulcan to the surrounding#
HOSHI: I wonder how long they've been there.#
HOSHI: Our ship-to-ship sensors are malfunctioning. I can only give you audio. Translator's active.#
HOSHI: The translation programme should be in pretty good shape, sir.#
HOSHI: They're responding.#
HOSHI: The afterlife.#
HOSHI: If you don't look too close, you'd think it was Earth.#
HOSHI: Is that Captain Mitchell?#
HOSHI: Travis has been digging through the archives.#
HOSHI: Captain, do you think anyone's still there?#
HOSHI: No answer, sir.#
HOSHI: He's not responding to hails, Captain, but he's alive.#
HOSHI: What do they do for food?#
HOSHI: What about these two? We have to assume they're armed.#
HOSHI: It's a transmission, sir. It's the last one anyone made, as far as we can tell. It was still in the buffer.#
HOSHI: The irony is that Captain Mitchell's message never reached Earth. The debris in the atmosphere was too dense.#
HOSHI: They went to visit some monks. Why would they scan for alien ships?#
HOSHI: You can't expect them to check in every ten minutes.#
HOSHI: You sure you're not over-reacting? They're probably just taking a tour, observing some kind of meditation ritual.#
HOSHI: I've lost the signal.#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir.#
HOSHI: Transmission from the surface. It's a modulated EM signal, very weak.#
HOSHI: No, it'll just scramble your molecules.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir.#
HOSHI: That means we discovered it.#
HOSHI: Captain, I'm detecting a vessel closing on our position. It's Vulcan.#
HOSHI: Commander, you wanted to see me?#
HOSHI: Looks like an encrypted transmission. It came from the Vulcan ship.#
HOSHI: Whenever you're ready, Captain.#
HOSHI: Well, Chloe, that's a very good question. We use a device called the universal translator. It's like an alien dictionary with hundreds of languages programmed into it, and it can learn new languages very quickly, but it doesn't always work, and when that happens it's up to me to try to translate. I'm sure I don't have to tell you it can be really hard sometimes. One wrong word can mean the difference between saying 'take my hand' or 'take my life'. So far I have managed to do pretty well.#
HOSHI: Sorry it took so long. The code was pretty complex.#
HOSHI: It's in Vulcan. You'll have to run it through the translation matrix.#
HOSHI: I didn't feel it'd be right.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir.#
HOSHI: Captain, you should take a look at this.#
HOSHI: The Vulcan ship's hailing us.#
HOSHI: Captain Vanik wants to know if we require assistance.#
HOSHI: Who? I'm picking up dozens of cities on each continent.#
HOSHI: I've got it.#
HOSHI: The acoustic relay is picking up dozens of languages. I could spend the next ten years studying this place.#
HOSHI: It'll take a while to work out a translation matrix for all of them. We'll be able to narrow it down for you once we pick a landing site. I did find the one word you might want to remember. Akaali. It's the name of their species.#
HOSHI: It itches.#
HOSHI: Are you sure I'm the right person for this?#
HOSHI: Maybe some of them are more advanced than others.#
HOSHI: Identification papers. Everyone in the city has to carry them.#
HOSHI: T'Pol.#
HOSHI: Her name's Riann, she's an apothecary.#
HOSHI: I think we may have seen some of them. Mottled skin, lesions on their faces.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed from the surface.#
HOSHI: I don't think so.#
HOSHI: The dampening field's down.#
HOSHI: It's the Captain.#
HOSHI: Even if we get the reactor, how are we going to keep them from taking it back?#
HOSHI: Their comm. systems may be down.#
HOSHI: There are four biosigns on the module. It's the away team.#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: Two hundred thousand kilometres ahead.#
HOSHI: Which ship, sir?#
HOSHI: I decided to turn in early.#
HOSHI: What'd they show?#
HOSHI: That bad?#
HOSHI: You could always read a book.#
HOSHI: They're responding.#
HOSHI: Two, briefly.#
HOSHI: Quiet. They're taking a tour of the ship.#
HOSHI: Don't worry, Lieutenant. They didn't look like the types who'd go around stealing military secrets.#
HOSHI: Should I call Engineering?#
HOSHI: Aren't you going to take the chair?#
HOSHI: You're in command.#
HOSHI: Haven't you ever wondered what it's like?#
HOSHI: Okay.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed by Captain Fraddock.#
HOSHI: And the transport ship is requesting permission to dock. Some of the passengers would like to take you up on your offer and observe it from the Mess Hall.#
HOSHI: Someone just used our comm. system to transmit a message.#
HOSHI: I'd like to send a few test transmissions to calibrate amplifiers. An hour.#
HOSHI: The channel's open, sir.#
HOSHI: Maybe they got our signal but it didn't make any sense to them. Our translator is far from perfect.#
HOSHI: Sir?  I tracked them down. It took me all week.#
HOSHI: Kota Baharu. It's in Malaysia.#
HOSHI: A little after nine at night.#
HOSHI: How'd it go?#
HOSHI: Me, sir?#
HOSHI: Maybe this is more in Chef's area.#
HOSHI: Sir, I'm running a diagnostic on our subspace transceiver array.#
HOSHI: Yes, sir.#
HOSHI: I'm picking up something.#
HOSHI: I don't think it's a language.#
HOSHI: We really would like to keep this a surprise.#
HOSHI: Really?#
HOSHI: Why?#
HOSHI: When he started eating again, do you remember the first thing he wanted?#
HOSHI: When you two were growing up he never said, hey, let's go out for pizza, boy, I'd love some Indian food?#
HOSHI: I'm figuring that out.#
HOSHI: What kind? Halibut? Swordfish?#
HOSHI: Mahi-mahi? Scallops?#
HOSHI: Great! And Malcolm?#
HOSHI: Try, please.#
HOSHI: Is that a fish?#
HOSHI: Thanks.#
HOSHI: I've talked to his sister, his best friend, his Uncle Archie, his two spinster aunts. The most anyone seems to know about his eating habits is that he occasionally eats.#
HOSHI: Anyone sitting here?#
HOSHI: This is the first chance I've had to eat all day.#
HOSHI: How's your ravioli?#
HOSHI: Nothing like a nice plate of pasta. You know, I used to love to cook but I never get a chance to anymore, and the way that Chef protects the galley. One of these nights, I should fix something myself.#
HOSHI: You'd love my enchiladas.#
HOSHI: If you don't like them, I can fix something else. What's your favourite food?#
HOSHI: Aren't you getting a little tired of having to eat whatever Chef happens to serve?#
HOSHI: Don't get me wrong. He's terrific. It's just that dinner in the Mess Hall can lack a certain personal touch. I've got a hot plate in my quarters.#
HOSHI: What do you mean?#
HOSHI: What does that have to do with?  Oh! No, I didn't, I didn't mean to imply anything other than just making dinner, Lieutenant.#
HOSHI: No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have. Yeah, I'll just.#
HOSHI: No, no, no, you've got a lot of work to do, so. (Hoshi leaves with her tray.)#
HOSHI: I can't raise Vulcan. It's funny. I ran a diagnostic after the attack, but now Echo Two won't respond.#
HOSHI: Doctor?#
HOSHI: I see you released your patients.#
HOSHI: That's good to hear.#
HOSHI: Any idea what his favourite food might be?#
HOSHI: Like what?#
HOSHI: How does he like them?#
HOSHI: Maybe Chef could make him a big omelette.#
HOSHI: Is there any one food in particular?#
HOSHI: Breaking a Vulcan encryption code would be easier than this.#
HOSHI: I don't suppose scanning his taste buds would help?#
HOSHI: Thanks anyways.#
HOSHI: Sorry?#
HOSHI: I'm under direct orders from the Captain. Couldn't you make an exception?#
HOSHI: What does all of this have to do with what he likes to eat?#
HOSHI: A plant enzyme.#
HOSHI: Found in?#
HOSHI: Pineapple!#
HOSHI: It's close enough. Thank you, Doctor.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI: At least there's one good thing about coming back this far. We can drop another subspace amplifier.#
HOSHI: Sorry to interrupt, Captain. I have that component that you asked for.#
HOSHI: We have our sources.#
HOSHI: People are getting jealous. You get more letters from home than anyone on this ship. What's her name?#
HOSHI: I didn't know there were humans serving on Denobula.#
HOSHI: I had a pen pal once when I was twelve, from Brisbane, Australia, and I loved getting her letters. It was like this little window into distant places with strange sounding names.#
HOSHI: Are we still on for later?#
HOSHI: I can hardly wait. (Hoshi leaves. Phlox sits down to listen to his letter.)#
HOSHI: The ship's not answering our hails, Captain.#
HOSHI: I need a little more.#
HOSHI:  How are your patients?#
HOSHI:  I'm sure you'll find a way to help them.#
HOSHI:  Do you like the food?#
HOSHI:  Eggplant's not a vegetable, it's a nostril.#
HOSHI:  A fruit.  I've noticed you and Crewman Cutler spending a lot of time together. Is there something going on between you two?#
HOSHI:  Are you two mating?#
HOSHI: Well, are you? (She speaks in Denobulan, but is having to use her PADD for#
HOSHI: There are ways you can tell.  Does she want to spend time with you? Does she find excuses to  to make physical contact?#
HOSHI: In Denobulan, Doctor.#
HOSHI:  I think you make a very cute washboard.#
HOSHI: Couple. A cute couple.#
HOSHI: Excuse me. We're the ones that brought him here. Can you tell me how he's doing?#
HOSHI: I'm sorry. Could you say that again?#
HOSHI: Captain, the UT can't translate his language.#
HOSHI: He doesn't speak the same language as you?#
HOSHI: Kuhl toh bah.#
HOSHI: He's says they'd be happy to help.#
HOSHI: Pra du matta.#
HOSHI: He wants to know what you're doing.#
HOSHI: Doctor, er, esatta prah koo kuvalakii.#
HOSHI: I told him the Doctor was looking inside of him.#
HOSHI: Tik tik.#
HOSHI: You're welcome.#
HOSHI: No, he must have picked it up by listening to us.#
HOSHI: Tik tik.#
HOSHI: Larr, ku rasata gol dach?#
HOSHI: He says the soil here isn't good for planting.#
HOSHI: The Valakians don't let them live where the land is fertile.#
HOSHI: The Valakians give them whatever they need. Food, clothing, medicine.#
HOSHI: He says the Valakians are good to them. They protect them.#
HOSHI: I'm going to help Larr finish packing up. He's back on duty at the hospital in an hour.#
HOSHI: It'll go out first thing in the morning. Everything all right?#
HOSHI: Want my advice? Get out of Sickbay.#
HOSHI: Good night.#
HOSHI: There are billions of people down there. It could take days.#
HOSHI: I'll try, but if the pod's been powered down it's almost impossible to pick up its signature.#
HOSHI: Sir, we're being hailed. Audio only.#
HOSHI: I can't tell.#
HOSHI: They've cut transmission.#
HOSHI: They were using a triaxilating signal.#
HOSHI: We're getting another transmission.#
HOSHI: It's not from the planet. It's coming from a Vulcan ship, the Ni'Var.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's the Vulcans.#
HOSHI: He's unavailable at the moment. Can I take a message?#
HOSHI: What shuttlepod is that?#
HOSHI: I really wouldn't know, sir. We get shuttlepods coming and going all the time. It's a little like Union Station around here. (She starts messing with the transmission frequency on her board.)#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, your transmission's breaking up.#
HOSHI: Ready.#
HOSHI: Any better?#
HOSHI: I never had this much trouble with the EM-33.#
HOSHI: You all right?#
HOSHI: I thought we were staying at warp for the next few days.#
HOSHI: So much for target practice.#
HOSHI: I'm trying, sir. There's a lot of EM interference. It sounds very strange.#
HOSHI: Do you have a minute, sir?#
HOSHI: That shipwreck. We have no idea what type of life forms we'll find on that alien vessel, and there's a lot of interference in the atmosphere. Are you sure the away team won't need a translator?#
HOSHI: What about the language on the control panels, the hatches? They might need someone to help them find their way around.#
HOSHI: I realise that I haven't always been the first one in line to volunteer for this type of mission, but I want you to know that I am prepared to go. Took a while, but I think I finally got my space legs.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir.#
HOSHI: I am. I'm just brushing up on the backup systems. I wouldn't want the emergency oxygen to fail during a hull breach.#
HOSHI: I'm perfectly comfortable. I used to find the suits a little claustrophobic, but I'm getting used to them. I'll see you in the shuttlepod.#
HOSHI: You sound uncomfortable, Sub-Commander.#
HOSHI: Or three valuable officers.#
HOSHI: That wasn't so bad.#
HOSHI: Is that a hatch on the port side?#
HOSHI: What's that?#
HOSHI: You first. (Reed opens his helmet and nods, T'Pol opens hers and#
HOSHI:  You can't smell that?#
HOSHI: Count your blessings.  HOSHI: You two might#
HOSHI: Klingon.  HOSHI: I thought you knew Klingon ships. Why didn't you recognise this one from the outside?#
HOSHI: How weak?#
HOSHI: Shouldn't we try to help them?#
HOSHI: How do you know?#
HOSHI: What if we carry some of them into the pod? We could save three or four.#
HOSHI: What's that?#
HOSHI: What about escape pods?#
HOSHI: Maybe we can use their comm. system to contact Enterprise.#
HOSHI: I'll try, but reading Klingon is a lot different than speaking it.#
HOSHI: All right.  Kolat chack tabak. Plasma containment, maybe.#
HOSHI: Containment. I'm certain.  HOSHI: Pu'DaH dak cha. Something they call photon torpedoes.#
HOSHI: Well, this all looks like weapons systems. Torpedoes, tactical sensors, disruptor arrays.#
HOSHI: I recognise pressure. Ka'tahl. That can mean wall or barrier.#
HOSHI: Maybe.#
HOSHI: I think you're right. Quee nagah. Impulse drive.#
HOSHI: It says the pressure's failing in the J'khat bah. Fusion manifold. Do you know what that means?#
HOSHI: We read you, Captain.#
HOSHI: Captain, you're breaking up. Captain?#
HOSHI: Come look at this. (She gets a recording playing on a screen in front of the captain's chair.)#
HOSHI: Wait, I saw that somewhere. Here. One deck below us. It's in the reactor pit.#
HOSHI: Could be.#
HOSHI: No. That says something about plasma induction. Here it is. Port fusion injector. (The panel has a Klingon slumped across it, so Reed and T'Pol haul him away.)#
HOSHI: Are you okay?#
HOSHI: I saw a galley on the schematics. Deck four, blue sector. I'll see what I can find.#
HOSHI: They look like worms.#
HOSHI: I promised myself I wouldn't do this.#
HOSHI: Don't you mean, for a human?#
HOSHI: This may sound strange but I envy you sometimes. I know, another pesky human emotion, but there are times I wish I could just ignore my feelings. Bury them the way Vulcans do.#
HOSHI: Excuse me?#
HOSHI: Whatever it is you're trying to do, it's not working.#
HOSHI: That was amazing.#
HOSHI: Thanks.#
HOSHI: I say we try the weapons.#
HOSHI: One thousand metres. Two thousand. Three thousand. (Detonation,#
HOSHI: We've moved up, but only two hundred metres.#
HOSHI: A compartment just collapsed. Deck three, green sector.#
HOSHI: Six.#
HOSHI: It won't be enough.#
HOSHI: We already tried. It didn't work.#
HOSHI: Fire them all. What if we detonated all the torpedoes at once?#
HOSHI: I don't know about you but I'm willing to take the chance.#
HOSHI: I was thinking more like five hundred. Look, I didn't come all this way to get crushed in the atmosphere of some anonymous gas giant. Loading ports one through six.#
HOSHI: Torpedoes armed. (as she presses the launch button, circuits explode on the bridge)#
HOSHI: You're closer.#
HOSHI: What if we picked up something your scans can't detect?#
HOSHI: Oh, I could stay in here all day.#
HOSHI: Do you smell that?#
HOSHI: Exactly.#
HOSHI: Dr. Phlox can only keep twelve of them in the Decon chamber at a time.#
HOSHI: He's rotating them. They seem to be doing fine on our atmosphere but they need at least six hours of boron gas a day. He says we've got enough to get them home.#
HOSHI: Yes, sir.#
HOSHI: They're pretty rattled. Most of them have been on that ship for years. It's a lot to digest they lost everything.#
HOSHI: No, and he feels terrible about the damage to Enterprise. He has no idea what went wrong. When they approached our docking port they lost control of their sensor array, and then a few seconds later their navigation system went out.#
HOSHI: I saw the wreckage on the asteroid. There wasn't much left.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us again.#
HOSHI: We'll have to send our readings to the publisher so they can put out a revised edition.#
HOSHI: Sir, I'm picking up a transmission from Echo three. (Archer signs a PADD and hands it back to the red-haired woman - a yeoman?)#
HOSHI: It's Admiral Forrest.#
HOSHI: How is that possible?#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: If this is anything like the Amazon, good luck.#
HOSHI: A campsite, sir.#
HOSHI: Are you studying wildlife here?#
HOSHI: One more reason I am happy to spend the night in my own bunk. Anyway, it's the things you can't see that I'd be worried about.#
HOSHI: Apparently they crawl into your ear to lay their eggs. Have a nice night.#
HOSHI: I wonder what caused the crash.#
HOSHI: You're not afraid it's really haunted, are you?#
HOSHI: I can't trace the signal. He must have scrambled the carrier wave.#
HOSHI: I'm tracing it now. Bearing one seven eight mark twelve.#
HOSHI: I'm triaxilating the signal, sir. If we were in the middle of Starfleet headquarters no one would pick it up.#
HOSHI: It's Captain Archer.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's him.#
HOSHI: Those patrol ships are closing fast.#
HOSHI: Here they come.#
HOSHI: Two direct hits. They're veering off.#
HOSHI: They took heavy damage. They're both attempting to land.#
HOSHI: Tostka. Insult. Some kind of an insult.#
HOSHI: I'm not sure.#
HOSHI: Kjass. Skjask las?#
HOSHI: You eat like you mate?#
HOSHI: I think they want to leave.#
HOSHI: Jhaaratun yiitooratt loorii.#
HOSHI: Does anybody hear that?#
HOSHI: Frequency distortions mixed in with the static.#
HOSHI: It's coming from the comm. system.#
HOSHI: Twice. I guess today is just not my day.#
HOSHI: Slowly. Hwajat, their word for eat.#
HOSHI: With the emphasis on the first syllable, hwa-jat, it means to mate.#
HOSHI: Context is critical in every language but Kreetassan has the most subtle variations I've ever seen. The same word can have a dozen different meanings.#
HOSHI: You think it was my fault?#
HOSHI: You implied it.#
HOSHI: But you think if I picked up the language faster they might have not stormed off the ship.#
HOSHI: Thanks.#
HOSHI: Commander, I'm picking up some kind of interference from the comm. system. A high-frequency distortion.#
HOSHI: Mostly just irritating.#
HOSHI: Thanks.#
HOSHI: No, thanks. I'm turning in early.#
HOSHI: I've had enough language problems for one day.(Out in the corridor Hoshi hears something, and puts her ear to the bulkhead. We see the filament creature on the other side.)#
HOSHI: How did it get onboard?#
HOSHI: I'll do my best.#
HOSHI: If it's intelligent maybe we can communicate with it. The frequency distortions, they look a lot like the phonetic patterns in certain Andorian dialects.#
HOSHI: What other choice do we have? Give me a chance.#
HOSHI: Sub-Commander.#
HOSHI: Believe me, you'd be the first to know. I'm sorry. It's frustrating. I'm not having a lot of luck.#
HOSHI: Maybe I don't have the expertise.#
HOSHI: I'm doing my best.#
HOSHI: I've made a little progress, but our translation matrix isn't designed for this. Look at it. It's more like a calculus equation than a language.#
HOSHI: What I'm trying to say is that I could use help from someone with a background in higher mathematics.#
HOSHI: I already tried.#
HOSHI: I wouldn't be much of a comm. officer if I didn't.#
HOSHI: Neither will questioning everything I do.#
HOSHI: I didn't ask for you to keep count of every time I make a mistake, or to second-guess all of my decisions.#
HOSHI: This goes beyond duty, Sub-Commander. You've been looking over my shoulder ever since you came on board. Double-checking my log entries, my translations.#
HOSHI: Is that all we're talking about? You don't think I belong on Enterprise, do you.#
HOSHI: Yes. Why don't we take another look at the sub-harmonics. I was thinking we could run it through the decryption matrix, see if we can find a pattern. All I see is numbers, codes.#
HOSHI: Here, here it is. I found a third set of repetitions. Try it. Just a few more and the UT can start building a syntax.#
HOSHI: I'm going to create distortions in the tone. Hopefully, the organism will understand what I'm trying to do. (Phlox's scanner shows vital signs at dangerously low levels. After her#
HOSHI: It's talking to us.#
HOSHI: Hold on. It's giving us coordinates.#
HOSHI: These look more like the latitude and longitude. I think it's trying to give us an exact location of the planet.#
HOSHI: Look at all of them.#
HOSHI: I read that at any time there can be thousands of visitors there speaking hundreds of different languages.#
HOSHI: How I relax is my business.#
HOSHI: Why don't you come with me?#
HOSHI: I'm happy to do it. I'm looking forward to meeting her.#
HOSHI: Thanks. Well, if there's anything else I can do.#
HOSHI: I just hope it's Spartan enough, sir.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's the Mazarite High Council.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: I can't get through. That ship's jamming all our comm. frequencies.#
HOSHI: He's not answering.#
HOSHI: Not dead enough.#
HOSHI: We were just talking about my quarters.#
HOSHI: Pash tah.#
HOSHI: Sub-Commander.#
HOSHI: Well, what's it like?#
HOSHI: Did you do anything there?#
HOSHI: Our aft sensors are still out of alignment.#
HOSHI: The Mazarites are still jamming us.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: I don't see how, sir.#
HOSHI: We may have gotten a message through to them, sir, but I'm not sure.#
HOSHI: The comm. just went down, sir.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI: No. It's coming from a city on the far side of the desert.#
HOSHI: That's the best I can give you. The entire region is flooded with jamming signals.#
HOSHI: Why Montana? Of all the places the Vulcans could have landed they chose Bozeman, Montana.#
HOSHI: Well, how did they know it wouldn't alarm other nations? An alien species makes contact with the United States. It could have made a lot of other countries nervous.#
HOSHI: It seems to me that we're going to run into similar problems. We get invited to dinner, and before you know it we're accused of taking sides in a war.#
HOSHI: He's hailing us.#
HOSHI: I'm glad you decided to take some time off, sir.#
HOSHI: That sounds kind of dangerous.#
HOSHI: Is that all you two think about?#
HOSHI: I plan on doing something constructive with my time. I have been relying on the universal translator far too much. Before I left Earth, I learned thirty eight languages and now all I do is push a button and the computer does all the work.#
HOSHI: Not this time. I left my translator on Enterprise.#
HOSHI: Tikara.#
HOSHI: It's a beautiful night.#
HOSHI: Why do you say that?#
HOSHI: Slowly please. I'm just learning Risan.#
HOSHI: When I go someplace I like to learn the language.#
HOSHI: Just today and tomorrow.#
HOSHI: Na. No. How am I doing?#
HOSHI: Sara.#
HOSHI: Thank you, I'll try.#
HOSHI: Goodnight. (The couple leave and a young man comes to Hoshi's table.)#
HOSHI: Ikara.#
HOSHI: Oh.#
HOSHI: It's my job. I'm the Communications Officer on a starship. Shikara Hoshi. My name is Hoshi#
HOSHI: About forty.#
HOSHI: Not yet. Klingon was hard. It took me months to master the conjugations.#
HOSHI: Where are you from?#
HOSHI: That's the name of your planet? Say it slower.#
HOSHI: Try it again.#
HOSHI: I'm not ready to give up. Will you teach me?#
HOSHI: I'm sorry. I give up. I never thought that I'd hear a language I couldn't learn.#
HOSHI: It only took you one day to pick up English.#
HOSHI: Teacher.#
HOSHI: Oh, we don't have anything exactly like it. The closest thing would be a strawberry.#
HOSHI: What?#
HOSHI: Sure. Why not?#
HOSHI: Kiss. That's called a kiss.#
HOSHI: Avec plaisir. That's French.#
HOSHI: Morning.#
HOSHI: Very.#
HOSHI: I could spend the entire day right here, but I'm afraid the shuttle's coming to pick me up in a few hours.#
HOSHI: Two days and two nights. That's all we had.#
HOSHI: Took advantage of me? Not for a minute.#
HOSHI: What's that smell?#
HOSHI: As a matter of fact, I learned several new conjugations.#
HOSHI: Enterprise to Shuttlepod one. Captain Archer, please respond.#
HOSHI: The shuttlepod's attitude isn't right.#
HOSHI: Not yet. Now.#
HOSHI: We could see the colony in full magnification, sir. The ground was scorched for at least a hundred kilometres in every direction.#
HOSHI: Sir, I tried to explain. There's nothing left. No buildings, no trees, no people.#
HOSHI: The atmospheric analysis of the probe is coming through.#
HOSHI: Even if they have, they'd take me back. I'm a prodigy, remember? How about you?#
HOSHI: What if they made you Captain? You're going to be the most famous Boomer around, you know.#
HOSHI: Then it's our job to let the people back home know what really happened. Anyone who tries to bad-mouth Captain Archer in front of me is going to get an earful in any language they want.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir.#
HOSHI: What for?#
HOSHI: We'll do our best, Captain.#
HOSHI: I wouldn't know, sir. Our comm. is on the fritz.#
HOSHI: Aren't we in range of their sensors, sir?#
HOSHI: They're charging weapons.#
HOSHI: The Stealth Cruiser was definitely in orbit of the Paraagan colony when the explosion took place. They were monitoring us very closely. There are sensors logs that tracked our course, our altitude, even our hull temperature. Look at these. (Lovely shots of Enterprise viewed from underneath with the planet behind.)#
HOSHI: Those cloaking devices sure come in handy.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI:  There's nothing left. No buildings, no trees, no people.#
HOSHI: We didn't have time to make a copy.#
HOSHI: Isn't there some other way that I can help out? Something that needs translating? You know how claustrophobic I am.#
HOSHI: Then how far to Lieutenant Reed's?#
HOSHI: Good guess.#
HOSHI: Great. If you don't mind I'd just like to get this over with.#
HOSHI: Whatever you're about to say I don't want to hear it. Just get me a shirt.#
HOSHI: Don't worry.#
HOSHI: Cell ships, thirty of them, thirty five, approaching at high warp.#
HOSHI: Not yet.#
HOSHI: The lead ships are overtaking us.#
HOSHI: Why'd they stop firing?#
HOSHI: No Vulcan ship.#
HOSHI: Tell him I'm on my way.#
HOSHI: The thyroid gland?#
HOSHI: Doctor.#
HOSHI: They need a translator. I should be at my post.#
HOSHI: Thank you, Doctor. ;#
HOSHI: I can try.#
HOSHI: They say they've annexed this planet in the name of something called The Romalin Star Empire.#
HOSHI: Five, sir, and it wasn't exactly grovelling.#
HOSHI: They were offended.#
HOSHI: Five days.#
HOSHI:  Go ahead.#
HOSHI:  Feel better, Porthos.#
HOSHI: It's their reconciliation demands. The Captain's not going to believe this.#
HOSHI: Captain, I didn't.#
HOSHI: Do we have a chainsaw on board?#
HOSHI: I apologise. We weren't aware that it was required.#
HOSHI: I'll explain it to the Captain immediately.#
HOSHI: I understand. I'll  HOSHI: I'll let him know.#
HOSHI: Hey, are you all right? What are they trying to do to you? HOSHI: The Kreetassans called, sir.#
HOSHI: They're anxious to get your response to their last transmission.#
HOSHI: They also suggested that we should synchronise our time to their capital city.#
HOSHI: It's not a requirement, sir, just a courtesy.#
HOSHI: How's Porthos?#
HOSHI: Go ahead.#
HOSHI: Feel better. (T'Pol isn't wearing a top when they face each other to massage decon gel into each others shoulders.)#
HOSHI: Yes, sir. Sub-commander T'Pol and I broke it down and#
HOSHI: It's a couplet from one of their oldest political documents.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir. They're barely within range.#
HOSHI: Nothing.#
HOSHI: Maybe it's abandoned.#
HOSHI: Still no response to our hails.#
HOSHI: I wanted to say goodbye.#
HOSHI: I've seen a body before. Fifteen of them on that alien ship.#
HOSHI: I was hoping it was another one of his practical jokes. Travis called me down to decon a few weeks ago. He said that he brought some kind of gelatinous lifeform aboard. He said it might be sentient, that the Captain needed me to figure out how to communicate with it.#
HOSHI: There was no lifeform. It was only strawberry gelatine. I told him I was going to get him back. I'm sorry.#
HOSHI: What?#
HOSHI: The station's tapped in to the ship's umbilical ports. It's overriding our command functions.#
HOSHI: I can't. Our access codes have been scrambled.#
HOSHI: Life support's failing.#
HOSHI: It's probably more deuterium customers.#
HOSHI: Do you mind, Lieutenant?  HOSHI: I can see your finger tensing on the trigger before you fire. It's throwing off your aim. I used to make the same mistake. Keep your eye on the target and don't squeeze the trigger until you have a clear shot. (She demonstrates,#
HOSHI: The Vulcan database says it has a methane-based atmosphere.#
HOSHI: There's no record of them ever having spoken, but I can't be certain.#
HOSHI: If he has, the Vulcan database doesn't mention it.#
HOSHI: I need to spend more time in the gym.#
HOSHI: I could have spent all day in that temple.#
HOSHI: I don't suppose it has anything to do with the tactical situation down there.#
HOSHI: Kultarey.#
HOSHI: I did everything but tear up the floor plating.#
HOSHI: I think I can narrow down the search, Captain. An inverse carrier wave should amplify its power signature. With any luck, I'll be able to isolate it.#
HOSHI: I'm getting something. I've got it down to two square kilometres.#
HOSHI: I'll try.#
HOSHI: I've isolated the signal to within three city blocks. That's the best I can do, sir.#
HOSHI: If they're in a public place, the communicator would draw attention.#
HOSHI: The comm. line's open.#
HOSHI: Somewhere in this district.#
HOSHI: It hasn't moved.#
HOSHI: Maybe they took a train or a car.#
HOSHI: There are nearly a hundred thousand people in that part of the city.#
HOSHI: They're here, inside this compound.#
HOSHI: Right away.#
HOSHI: Sub-Commander, another communiqu�. It's from a General Gosis to the Chancellor. He said they've captured two enemy spies. They're going to hang them.#
HOSHI: The orange spinach?#
HOSHI: Why don't we let him tackle that when he gets back? I have something else in mind. HOSHI: It's one of my grandmother's specialties. The recipe's been passed down for generations.#
HOSHI: Oh no. You can resequence all the chicken and potatoes you want, but I am making this from scratch.#
HOSHI: How is it?#
HOSHI: Enjoying your lunch?#
HOSHI: It's called oden. Every Japanese family has their own way of preparing it.#
HOSHI: Thank you. Lieutenant, you barely touched yours.#
HOSHI: I'll get you a fresh bowl.#
HOSHI: It's no problem.#
HOSHI: Are you sure there's nothing wrong with it?#
HOSHI: Salty?  HOSHI: It tastes fine.#
HOSHI: Is this too salty? Something's not right. Hand me the Kreetassan spice. I'll add it to the stock. Oh, I'm out of carrots.#
HOSHI: Carrots!#
HOSHI: I believe I'm in charge of the galley.#
HOSHI: You're relieved.#
HOSHI: Get out!#
HOSHI: I have eighty three people to feed, not just senior officers.#
HOSHI: I don't have time for special orders. Anyway, you'll like this better.#
HOSHI: It'll be ready in one minute, sir.#
HOSHI: If you're so hungry, fix yourself a sandwich.#
HOSHI: That is a very complex recipe. I will not serve it till it's just right. My family's reputation is at stake.#
HOSHI: These are at least three hundred years older than the ones in the last chamber.#
HOSHI: No. How about you?#
HOSHI: You're a budding linguist. Let's get a shot of that one.(A#
HOSHI: Captain, these ruins have very thick walls. I'm sure we'll be safe inside.#
HOSHI: Over four thousand years old. I'm sure they've survived hundreds of these storms.#
HOSHI: Couldn't we wait it out inside the shuttle? Polarise the hull plating.#
HOSHI: Have you ever done this?#
HOSHI: Your molecules get pulled apart.#
HOSHI: Do you know how many molecules you're made up of?#
HOSHI: All right, how many?#
HOSHI: That's a pretty big jigsaw puzzle. What if some other pieces get put in the wrong place? You know, I bet a lot of them look real similar.#
HOSHI: Okay, okay, but you go first and if you get to Enterprise in one piece I'll be right behind you.#
HOSHI:  Commander?#
HOSHI: I'm on my way, sir. HOSHI: Ensign Sato ready for transport.#
HOSHI: I'll let you know.#
HOSHI: Come in.#
HOSHI: I guess you could say that, sir. I'll be at my post in a few minutes. I just want to clean up and change.#
HOSHI: Thank you.#
HOSHI: Sir?#
HOSHI: I'm sure Commander Tucker can find someone else to hold the second flash unit.#
HOSHI: I don't want to get lost.#
HOSHI: Too much excitement for one day. I could really use some rest, sir.#
HOSHI: Anyone sitting here?#
HOSHI: Is anyone sitting here?#
HOSHI: It was very unsettling. Didn't you find it unsettling?#
HOSHI: I don't know. I just don't feel right.#
HOSHI: Not the storms, it's the transporter. I don't feel like myself since I went through it. I need to check the medical database and find out what happened to people they used when they were testing that thing.#
HOSHI: Cyrus Ramsey?#
HOSHI: Am I supposed to?#
HOSHI: What happened to him?#
HOSHI: What happened to him?#
HOSHI: I must have fallen asleep before the ghost stories.#
HOSHI: See you later.#
HOSHI: Doctor? Doctor Phlox. Hello?#
HOSHI: I just looked in there. Were you in there? Did you hear me come in?#
HOSHI: You didn't hear me?#
HOSHI: No, I'm not feeling well. I dematerialised, and then I rematerialised and, no, I'm not feeling well.#
HOSHI: Doctor, I'm not talking about the storms. I'm talking about my molecules.#
HOSHI: Don't tell me they talk about him on Denobula.#
HOSHI: I just don't feel right. Ever since the transport, I've been shaky, not myself.#
HOSHI: No? How about this?#
HOSHI: It's not where it used to be. It was a good centimetre lower.#
HOSHI: It's not a joke, Doctor. If that machine could move a birthmark, who knows what else it could do. I'm telling you, I don't feel right.#
HOSHI: Hello?#
HOSHI: What time is it?#
HOSHI: Eleven hundred hours, that's impossible. My shift starts at oh eight hundred.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, Captain, I don't know what happened.#
HOSHI: Taken hostage by who?#
HOSHI: People? There wasn't a biosign on the planet.#
HOSHI: How could you possibly know that?#
HOSHI:  It's Mayweather's communicator.#
HOSHI: I need more.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir, it's not working. I'm going to need more.#
HOSHI: Ajas sukas.#
HOSHI: Tag zra uras turana.#
HOSHI: If I went back to the universal translator, maybe I could#
HOSHI: I can't.#
HOSHI: I know. I don't understand what he's saying. I'm, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.#
HOSHI: Captain, I realise I overslept. I don't know how it happened, but please, I don't want to go back to my quarters.#
HOSHI: Anyone sitting here? Sub-commander?#
HOSHI: Thank you. I would've thought you'd be on the Bridge.#
HOSHI: Commander Tucker. Travis.#
HOSHI: It's only been an hour since I left the Bridge. What happened?#
HOSHI: I don't understand. How?#
HOSHI: That's impossible. I ran every linguistic algorithm.#
HOSHI: If we've decrypted their language, I should get back to the Bridge. It sounds like the Captain might want to speak with them again.#
HOSHI: Alison.#
HOSHI: What?#
HOSHI: Can you see me?#
HOSHI: Can you see me?#
HOSHI: Something's wrong, Doctor. Something's very wrong. Ever since I used that transporter nothing has been the way that it's supposed to be. I couldn't translate a simple, bi-modal syntax, but Crewman Baird could. Crewman Baird doesn't know the first thing about our linguistic database. And Captain Archer told me to stay in my quarters, but my mirror doesn't want to give me a solid reflection and my shower can't decide whether to bounce off me or go through me. Nobody wants to talk to me. Sometimes I think they don't even see that I'm there. The turbolift control won't even respond to me.#
HOSHI: You won't put this on my medical record, will you?#
HOSHI: Not funny, Doctor.#
HOSHI: If it's all the same to you the last thing I need right now is to be medicated.#
HOSHI: First thing. Thank you, Doctor.#
HOSHI: I was taught never to contradict a superior officer. The Captain told me what happened. Did they treat you all right?#
HOSHI: I'm sorry I wasn't more helpful trying to translate. I don't know what happened.#
HOSHI: I get motion sickness, remember? Have you felt okay since we were transported yesterday?#
HOSHI: I didn't think I was, but the doctor seems to feel my symptoms are psychological.#
HOSHI: I just haven't been myself. Everything's a little off ,even the laws of physics.#
HOSHI: It's okay. Phlox promises me I'll be fine.#
HOSHI: I hope it's just a question of being anxious.#
HOSHI: I saw my reflection become transparent. I saw water pass right through my hand. I'm not convinced that the transporter put me back the way it was supposed to.#
HOSHI: You men are all alike.#
HOSHI: Thank God you're here. I've been stuck in here for hours. The door control is#
HOSHI: Commander.#
HOSHI: Yes, she is.#
HOSHI: It wasn't your fault.#
HOSHI: You're wrong, Doctor. I'm still in one piece. You just can't see me.#
HOSHI: Don't waste your time. It's not me.#
HOSHI: If you spent a little more time trying to figure out what happened to#
HOSHI: Lieutenant?#
HOSHI: You can see me?#
HOSHI: Captain, I need you to listen to me. There are aliens on board from the surface. They're planting bombs on D deck. You've got to hear me. The ship is in danger.#
HOSHI: You don't have time for this.#
HOSHI: I'll find something that'll get your attention. (She starts going around the room, putting her hand into the bulkheads at various places.)#
HOSHI: We're all going to be dead if I don't get him to notice this.#
HOSHI: How about Morse code? You know Morse Code, don't you?#
HOSHI: Come on, listen.#
HOSHI: Can you hear it?#
HOSHI: Come on.  HOSIHI: That's right. It's not supposed to be making that noise, is it? Listen, you can hear it. SOS. SOS. It's a call for help. I need you to hear it. (Archer sees the indicator light on the ceiling beam flashing in time to Hoshi's signal.)#
HOSHI: That's right, show it to her. One of you will figure it out.#
HOSHI: Let's see how good your memory is. H, O,#
HOSHI: S, H,#
HOSHI: I. Come on.#
HOSHI: I'm not outside this room, I'm right here.#
HOSHI: Tomorrow's too late. They're going to blow up the ship. Captain!(The aliens have finished planting their devices in the Jefferies, and are now arming them. Hoshi follows them as they go to Engineering,;where she watches through a ventilation grill as they put devices on the warp core right under the eyes of the unseeing engineering staff.)#
HOSHI: No, wait!#
HOSHI: What?#
HOSHI: Where are they? We've got to stop them.#
HOSHI: You heard me? You can hear me? Do you see me?#
HOSHI:  It's not fine. They put a bomb on the warp reactor.#
HOSHI: The aliens from the surface.#
HOSHI: What are you talking about? They kidnapped you and Travis. We've got to stop them.#
HOSHI: Trouble?#
HOSHI: Are you saying that I was just on the surface?#
HOSHI: Do you have a mirror?#
HOSHI: Forget it. And I was sure I was going to be the next Cyrus Ramsey.#
HOSHI: Well, I hope you don't plan on beaming me anywhere for a long time.#
HOSHI: I was trying to save Enterprise.#
HOSHI: It's all in my head, remember?#
HOSHI: If it's all the same to you, sir, I'd like to stick to shuttlepods for the time being.#
HOSHI: Captain, if you don't mind.#
HOSHI: Commander? Hello?#
HOSHI: Give or take an adverb.#
HOSHI: At least you don't have to work alone.#
HOSHI: Who is she? Any idea?#
HOSHI: A doctor?#
HOSHI: It's not polite to stare, Commander.#
HOSHI: Let me know if you have any problems with that translation.#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: Pretty well, sir. A few days in this place should cure anyone of claustrophobia.#
HOSHI: You're the Captain. Can't you order the storm to calm down a little?#
HOSHI: I'm out of desserts.#
HOSHI: Thanks, Chef.#
HOSHI: Who's picking these movies? Shouldn't we all get a vote?#
HOSHI: I've isolated your comm. frequencies. They won't hear a thing.#
HOSHI: Enterprise to Shuttlepod One. Commander Tucker, do you read me?#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.(A grey skinned alien with aggressive bony ridges radiating out across the face from the bridge of his nose.)#
HOSHI: Captain, I'm picking up a transmission.#
HOSHI: I can't tell yet. I'm trying to get a lock.#
HOSHI: It doesn't make any sense.#
HOSHI: We're orbiting an alien world, and most of the crew are free to go down and visit. Why would anyone want to stay on board and watch a movie?#
HOSHI: It sounds like you're the one picking the movies.#
HOSHI: Who else would choose an obscure horror film? Why not something a little more, I don't know, romantic? I'm going down to the surface.#
HOSHI: There's a shuttle leaving at eighteen hundred hours.#
HOSHI: Okay, but I have to leave in a few minutes.#
HOSHI: Please. I'm Hoshi Sato. I've been meaning to introduce myself.#
HOSHI:  Doctor Phlox has been teaching me Denobulan.#
HOSHI:  I'm still having trouble with the transitive verbs.#
HOSHI: Matter of fact, we were.#
HOSHI: She's pulling your leg, sir. I was only talking about grammar.#
HOSHI: I've got to go. It was very nice to meet you.#
HOSHI: I'm trying, sir, but if the Vulcans can't find them.#
HOSHI: Yes, sir.#
HOSHI: Commander.#
HOSHI: I can't be sure. You see this EM differential here?#
HOSHI: It's definitely a biosign. I'm ninety percent sure it's human.#
HOSHI: I need another hour.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed by the Vulcans and the Andorians.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed from the surface. It's the Captain.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI: Someone's trying to open Launch bay two.#
HOSHI: I can't.#
HOSHI: I don't know, but I don't think he was paying you a compliment.#
HOSHI: No response. We're being hailed by the Suliban.#
HOSHI: Their comm. system's down.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: They've locked on to both docking ports.#
HOSHI: They're cutting through the doors.#
HOSHI: They're disengaging.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. A Vulcan transport is en route to tow the Tal'Kir. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Our long range scanners show no sign of Tholians or Suliban in our vicinity.#
HOSHI: Please respond. Enterprise to Shuttlepod One. Captain Archer, please respond.#
HOSHI: There's only one more log entry after that. Something about a pan zan match.#
HOSHI: It's a sporting event. The Captain said it was the closest thing to water polo he's seen since we left Earth.#
HOSHI: I'm picking up an automated distress signal.#
HOSHI: The signal originated near our rendezvous coordinates, but they've stopped transmitting.#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: They're trying to hail the prison transport. They're not getting a response.#
HOSHI: We're in visual range.#
HOSHI: No response, sir. I'm not even detecting a transceiver on board.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir. Captain, we've been getting reports from all over the ship. Some of the crew are acting very strange.#
HOSHI: We polarised the hull plating as soon as we detected that ship. Obviously it didn't do any good. What's keeping them from taking all of us?#
HOSHI: I thought you said we needed to get out of here.#
HOSHI: It would be best if they stayed where they were.#
HOSHI: We're offering them a great opportunity. They may never get another chance to experience existence as we do.#
HOSHI: I understand how you may be frightened by all this. Losing your substance, existing as perceptive energy, but you'll be grateful once you've made the crossing, I promise you.#
HOSHI: Those who've preceded you are safe and happy. They'll understand.#
HOSHI: You'll understand.#
HOSHI: I need to find the rest of your crew. Where are they?#
HOSHI: No, sir.#
HOSHI: Echo Three's within range. It shouldn't be too hard to set up a downlink. [Situation room]#
HOSHI: Feeding time?#
HOSHI: What is that?#
HOSHI: Why? Is it dangerous?#
HOSHI: I just came by to give you this transmission. It's from the Denobulan Science Academy. Marked urgent.#
HOSHI: Their reactor casings ruptured. The Captain's asking the Xantoras for permission to go back down.#
HOSHI: He says his time is precious.#
HOSHI: Enterprise to Commander Tucker. Please respond.#
HOSHI: The interference is pretty heavy, sir.#
HOSHI: Does Starfleet know where the vessel is now?#
HOSHI: Rootleaf lettuce for your slugs, Vulcan sandworms for the bat and angel hair pasta for the ship's physician.#
HOSHI: You need to keep up your strength.#
HOSHI: Well, it's right here if you change your mind.#
HOSHI: Oh, it's Lieutenant Reed's idea. If you come near me, I'm supposed to shoot you.#
HOSHI: It's going to be a few hours before we catch up with that transport. I'm sure that Captain Archer wouldn't mind if I stayed for a little while, kept you company.#
HOSHI: I'm armed, remember? You've looked after me more times than I can count. I want to return the favour.#
HOSHI: Do you mind if I feed your animals before I go? [Maintenance area] (The exposed circuits have a lot of green about them.)#
HOSHI: They're sending a transmission, some kind of activation sequence.#
HOSHI: I can't. [Maintenance area] (The Starfleet displays vanish from the monitors and are replaced with alien ones made of roundels.)#
HOSHI: They're hailing us. Audio only.#
HOSHI: They're cutting into the hull. E deck, starboard forequarter.#
HOSHI: Sorry to interrupt, Captain. It's Admiral Forrest.#
HOSHI: You're being hailed, Captain.#
HOSHI: He's speaking to Admiral Forrest. It�s the third time in the last hour.#
HOSHI: They're not responding.#
HOSHI: They want you, sir. They're saying they won't destroy Enterprise if you surrender to them. Archer's an enemy of the Empire. He must be brought to justice if honour's to be regained.#
HOSHI: I think I might need to brush up on my Japanese.#
HOSHI: That'll make life a whole lot easier.#
HOSHI: Not so magical.#
HOSHI: I haven't read it yet.#
HOSHI: Captain, I'm sending these books home to my mother. It'll give me more shelf space. There's been a lot written about alien languages since we've been gone.#
HOSHI: My mother. Thought it was time to upgrade my civvies.#
HOSHI: Why would you think that?#
HOSHI: And that means I'm not capable of handling myself on the new mission?#
HOSHI: I don't know what's inside this Expanse, sir, but I think I've proven that I can handle myself in difficult situations and even provide a little help along the way. I assume you have no problem with my remaining on board.#
HOSHI: We've been in here for more then six hours.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI: The Expanse is ahead, Captain.#
HOSHI: I'm Hoshi Sato.#
HOSHI: Military Assault Command.#
HOSHI: You seem to have all gotten your space legs.#
HOSHI: What do you think of our doctor, Sergeant? I imagine you don't run into many Denobulans in Duluth, Minnesota.#
HOSHI: You may have left Duluth, but you've still got plenty of Duluth left in your inflections.#
HOSHI: I'm sure Captain Archer will let us know when he has reason to.#
HOSHI: Everybody plus one.#
HOSHI: Still at warp four. ETA approximately seven minutes.#
HOSHI: Our transceiver's offline.#
HOSHI: There would still be some residual particles.#
HOSHI: Pretty close. Less than a kilometre, but we need to have the access codes.#
HOSHI: Go ahead.#
HOSHI: We're not close enough.#
HOSHI: Another fifty metres. I'm into the computer.#
HOSHI: I haven't found the Xindi database. I'm losing them.#
HOSHI: I've found it, Captain.#
HOSHI: A few minutes.#
HOSHI: They're getting too far away. I'm losing the comm. link again.#
HOSHI: About a third of it.#
HOSHI: I'm back in.#
HOSHI: I've got eighty percent, eighty five.#
HOSHI: I've got ninety percent.#
HOSHI: Right about the time the Xindi were here.#
HOSHI: Captain. A body.#
HOSHI: Maybe it was one of the other two.#
HOSHI: Are you all right?#
HOSHI: Why are you talking to her? She's trying to delay us. Our people are there.#
HOSHI: Don't trust her. She's not one of us.#
HOSHI: Urquat?#
HOSHI: Tell me. What was it like?#
HOSHI: Someone's coming.#
HOSHI: Can I help you?#
HOSHI: I know. News travels fast on a starship. I'm Ensign Hoshi Sato.#
HOSHI: I just happen to be going that way.#
HOSHI: I'm the ship's Communications Officer.#
HOSHI: I'd love to hear your language.#
HOSHI: : Bridge to Captain Archer.#
HOSHI: Three point two light years, bearing oh one six mark twelve.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir.#
HOSHI: It's altered the course of#
HOSHI: Understood. [Seleya Engineering] (They enter through a ceiling hatch.)#
HOSHI: Hello?#
HOSHI: Ensign Sato to Security.#
HOSHI: Maybe our sensors missed something.#
HOSHI: That I'm imagining things?#
HOSHI: I thought that was called paranoia.#
HOSHI: What I saw wasn't a shadow.#
HOSHI: Are there any more tests that you can run?#
HOSHI: The last few days I've had the strangest feeling that I am being watched. I've heard whispering down corridors, in my quarters. Could I have been exposed to something that's making me hallucinate?#
HOSHI: So basically this is all in my head.#
HOSHI: Great.#
HOSHI: It's not a good sign when you start to see things that aren't there.#
HOSHI: I should get going. T'Pol's asked me to translate a section of the Xindi database. [Command centre] TARQUIN#
HOSHI: Ensign Sato to Lieutenant Reed. I need help in the Command Centre.#
HOSHI: Who are you?#
HOSHI: How did you get on board?#
HOSHI: What do you want?#
HOSHI: I am not imagining it, Captain.#
HOSHI: With respect, sir, I know that my mind can be overactive sometimes, but that is not what's happening. This is real.#
HOSHI: Isn't it about feeding time?#
HOSHI: Would you mind? I'm really not that tired.#
HOSHI: That's strange. It's. When the alien communicates with me, it's almost like he's inside my head, looking at things through my eyes, experiencing what I'm experiencing, and talking to him is like talking to myself. Does that make any sense?#
HOSHI: What?#
HOSHI: Why me?#
HOSHI: What do you want?#
HOSHI: I don't think that'll be possible.#
HOSHI: He's saving that for my visit.#
HOSHI: I think he wants to help. He was horrified that seven million of us were killed. He says he's willing to use his abilities to help us find the Xindi. I think that's reason enough to meet with him.#
HOSHI: We don't have the luxury of dealing with one problem at a time anymore, sir. If he can tell us something about the Xindi weapon it's worth the risk. I can take care of myself, Captain. [Tarquin's study] (Archer opens a case containing the 'future' element of the Xindi weapon.)#
HOSHI: Thanks. I need a minute.#
HOSHI: I think that falls under the goes without saying category, sir.#
HOSHI: I'll keep it under my pillow.#
HOSHI: Do you always eat like this?#
HOSHI: Thank you.#
HOSHI: You have certainly done your homework.#
HOSHI: What's this?#
HOSHI: You know, my stomach is a little unsettled.#
HOSHI: Since you seen to know so much about my past, I think it's only fair that I know a little about yours. Where are you from?#
HOSHI: What do you mean?#
HOSHI: Are you reading my mind continuously?#
HOSHI: This is great, but I'm pretty tired.#
HOSHI: I'm sure there's enough to keep me occupied.#
HOSHI: Thank you.#
HOSHI: I won't, I'll be busy with this.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.#
HOSHI: I'm about halfway through.#
HOSHI: Aren't you supposed to know me better than that?#
HOSHI: It's an interesting language, reminds me of medieval Klingon. Any progress?#
HOSHI: That's what we've heard.#
HOSHI: Do you know where they're building the weapon?#
HOSHI: What's this?#
HOSHI: Is that possible?;#
HOSHI: I think so.#
HOSHI: How do you make sense of all that?#
HOSHI: Maybe later. I should let you get back to your work.#
HOSHI: Thanks.#
HOSHI: Is this why you didn't want me out here? Who are they?#
HOSHI: How did they die?#
HOSHI: How old are you?#
HOSHI: Who were they?#
HOSHI: And the other three?#
HOSHI: You're right. We should go back inside.#
HOSHI: You know that Enterprise is on an important mission. I just can't abandon my duties.#
HOSHI: Do you really expect me to spend the rest of my life on a desolate world with someone I have known for less than two days?#
HOSHI: I am grateful for your help and I'm happy to stay here while you work, but I have no intention of becoming your next companion.#
HOSHI: If you think projecting yourself as human is going to make me change my mind, you're mistaken.#
HOSHI: You obviously misinterpreted a few memories, because this situation is very different.#
HOSHI: I don't need you to help me do that.#
HOSHI: I already told you, I'm not interested.#
HOSHI: What I'm thinking is none of your business!#
HOSHI: Leave me alone.#
HOSHI: Leave me alone!#
HOSHI: Thank you for all your help.#
HOSHI: I can't stay here, you know that.#
HOSHI: The next time you invite someone for a visit, you might want to let them know you're looking for a life-long companion.#
HOSHI: I was hoping you'd say that. I'm nearly done, and I'm anxious to see how it ends.#
HOSHI: It'll be good to get back to Enterprise.#
HOSHI: Glad I could help, sir.#
HOSHI: I assume you told him that wouldn't be possible.#
HOSHI: I'll go back to my quarters and pick up a few things.#
HOSHI: I should brief my replacement on the UT upgrades.#
HOSHI: At least give me a chance to say goodbye to the crew!#
HOSHI: It won't take long. Sir, I might not see my friends again.#
HOSHI: Travis?#
HOSHI: I was just thinking about Travis. You're a regular mind reader.#
HOSHI: Where is Captain Archer?#
HOSHI: Where is he?#
HOSHI: Where is Captain Archer!#
HOSHI: What is that supposed to mean?#
HOSHI: What's happened to Enterprise?#
HOSHI: Let me speak to Captain Archer.#
HOSHI: Why the hell not?#
HOSHI: Why can't I speak to Captain Archer?#
HOSHI: You would kill over eighty people to keep me here?#
HOSHI: I'm counting on that. Now, undo whatever you've done to my ship or you will never contact anyone again with this thing.#
HOSHI: As long as I'm with you. Another sixty, seventy years, and then what.  What'll you do when I'm grave number five out there? Without this you will never find another companion. You will be alone for the rest of your life.#
HOSHI: This is your last chance.#
HOSHI: What are you doing here?#
HOSHI: You can't do this. I don't want you watching me.#
HOSHI: Why now?#
HOSHI: He came to my quarters.#
HOSHI: He gave me these coordinates.#
HOSHI: A Xindi colony. He said they're building part of the weapon there.#
HOSHI: Who are you?#
HOSHI: What do you want?#
HOSHI: A Xindi colony. He said they're building part of the weapon there.#
HOSHI: It's the Captain. Go ahead, sir.#
HOSHI: The radiolytic signature. If you can get it onboard their ship, I'll be able to track it.#
HOSHI: Loud and clear.#
HOSHI: Captain! (Everyone stares in horror at the viewscreen, as the Xindi weapon blasts Earth into tiny pieces.) [Archer and T'Pol's home] (Archer wakes in a light, airy room. His hair is shot through with grey. He goes through to the kitchen where T'Pol is pouring orange juice.)#
HOSHI: I�m reading more anomalies ahead.#
HOSHI: They�re locking on to the starboard docking port.#
HOSHI: I�m reading twenty three intruders on decks C, D and E.#
HOSHI: They�re hailing us.#
HOSHI: Not everyone, sir.#
HOSHI: He�s moving.#
HOSHI: Aye, sir.#
HOSHI: Two of their ships are breaking off. They�re following us.#
HOSHI: Still heading towards the planet. (As Enterprise leads the two ships off, two more appear at the rear and attack the intruders.)#
HOSHI: The other Xindi ships have changed their heading.#
HOSHI: Hull breaches on B deck, C deck!#
HOSHI: I'm still working on the translation, sir.#
HOSHI: There are a lot of reports of disciplinary problems, and then six months after they arrived, the logs end.#
HOSHI: Numerous injuries throughout the ship. Mostly minor, except for one. Commander Tucker. He's been taken to Sickbay. [Deleted scene - Bridge]#
HOSHI: That's very good.#
HOSHI: We just showed you this book. How do you know about the Martian machines?#
HOSHI: Your mum?#
HOSHI: Captain, I'm reading one person in there. [Launch bay]#
HOSHI: Loud and clear.#
HOSHI: The signal was so weak I wasn't even sure it was there at first.#
HOSHI: Yes, sir. The isotopic signature matches the kemocite that you planted on the Xindi ship.#
HOSHI: We've managed to dig about thirty percent of our lost data out of the redundant memory core.#
HOSHI: Here.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: It's coming in. (image of a blue gas giant, a moon and four ships on the viewscreen)#
HOSHI: Just before we went to warp we received a transmission from the Andorian ship.#
HOSHI: Apparently they had time to take some detailed scans while it was aboard their ship.#
HOSHI: For a moment, I thought he was going to give you the co-ordinates.#
HOSHI: I may have something here, sir. I think these are fragments from a personal file. There are parts of a letter from someone named Degra.#
HOSHI: No. There's a reference to a planet he visited recently, Azati Prime.#
HOSHI: I've recovered a letter Degra wrote to his wife a few months ago. Her name's Naara. They have two children.#
HOSHI: This is going to be a rough one, sir.#
HOSHI: I've got it.#
HOSHI: Their sensors are pretty sophisticated. They might see us long before then.#
HOSHI: The Captain's certainly drinking a lot.#
HOSHI: That you'd been captured by the insectoids. There were reports that you had been executed.#
HOSHI: They're coming in. One one two seven point four by four zero five two by three nine zero one point one.#
HOSHI: There's something in his hand.#
HOSHI: Piral and Jaina.#
HOSHI: It's not in here, sir.#
HOSHI: Why would he encrypt the coordinates if they weren't accurate?#
HOSHI: Military Assault Command.#
HOSHI: They're coming in.#
HOSHI: Captain, I'm picking up an intermittent signal. Very faint.#
HOSHI: You did this.#
HOSHI: You said we'd be safe.#
HOSHI: You promised us!#
HOSHI: It's an insectoid, three biosigns aboard.#
HOSHI: Their main deflector's charging. They could be trying to open a vortex.#
HOSHI: Almost.#
HOSHI: Understood.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, Major. (Hayes starts to back up to open a comm. channel himself, and Travis jumps him. One Starfleet and two MACOs get stunned. Reed holds a pistol to Hayes' head.)#
HOSHI: It's Commander Tucker.#
HOSHI: If Commander Tucker wants to speak insectoid I have to get this#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: Comm.'s down.#
HOSHI: I thought Insectoid was tough.#
HOSHI: My mother always wanted me to take piano lessons. I should have listened to her.#
HOSHI: I've gone through the databanks. Just your standard navigational operational files, but I did find one document. An engineer asking his supervisors for additional parts. Here's a translation.#
HOSHI: The names of Degra's children.#
HOSHI: They're still hailing us.#
HOSHI: We have another hull breach, on E deck.#
HOSHI: Scanning all frequencies. Nothing so far.#
HOSHI: We're receiving a transmission. It's Degra. He's telling us to follow him.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: Captain, the temperature in Lieutenant Reed's suit is over forty four degrees.#
HOSHI: Forty six degrees.#
HOSHI: Captain, Degra's hailing us.#
HOSHI: We're within visual range.#
HOSHI: I don't think that's Colombia.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI: Two, a boy and a girl. Toru and Yoshiko.#
HOSHI: I don't know. It was probably in their database but I didn't look it up.#
HOSHI: Some things are better left a mystery. How about you, did you get married?#
HOSHI: A MACO? How well do you know her?#
HOSHI: Yeah? You should ask her out.#
HOSHI: So, Lieutenant, who'd you end up with? On the other Enterprise. Did you get married, have kids?#
HOSHI: Women only make up a third of the crew. There were bound to be a few bachelors left over.#
HOSHI: Me too. See you later, sir.#
HOSHI: They've undocked.#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: We've lost power on C deck.#
HOSHI: It's Degra. He's hailing us.#
HOSHI: It depends on which dialect. There are sixty seven.#
HOSHI: When Aquatics use the past tense they switch to sonar.#
HOSHI: It's beautiful.#
HOSHI: I was never called to the Principal's office.#
HOSHI: What for?#
HOSHI: He said, the Guardians have never lied to us.#
HOSHI:  This is not relevant. We're here to discuss the human's claims.#
HOSHI: You don't want to know.#
HOSHI: Sir?#
HOSHI: What'd she say?#
HOSHI: Some women can't resist the bad boys. {Council chamber]#
HOSHI:  You've already presented this information.#
HOSHI:  How do we know the data used to create this phantom wasn't falsified.#
HOSHI:  It is a Guardian. We are not deceived by this illusion. Restore the dignity of our Council. Expel the humans from this chamber.#
HOSHI: [translating aquatic) We agree.#
HOSHI: The weapon's been launched from beneath the surface. The Insectoid ships are in formation around it.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI: It's the shuttlepod.#
HOSHI: Why am I here? What do you want?#
HOSHI: Maybe you should have applied yourself more.#
HOSHI: I'm not a cryptologist.#
HOSHI: That's very flattering, but you'll have to manage on your own.#
HOSHI: I'm to bypass the Aquatic encryption protocols.#
HOSHI: I'm not familiar with these cyphers. I'm trying.#
HOSHI: I'm not feeling very well. Do you think you can get Phlox to come down here?#
HOSHI: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.#
HOSHI: I gave them the third code. They wouldn't have been able to arm the weapon if I hadn't given them the third code.#
HOSHI: I did. I should have fought harder.#
HOSHI: I tried to jump but I wasn't fast enough.#
HOSHI: You've got the three codes so why don't you just kill me? Didn't you say you're going to kill me?#
HOSHI: I understand.#
HOSHI: What have you guys figured out?#
HOSHI: I've found the sequence, but decrypting it's another story. Your friend Degra didn't make this easy.#
HOSHI: The first time you came to visit me in Brazil.#
HOSHI: I had a bug then, too. A tropical bacterium not a reptilian parasite. I was sick as a dog but I wanted to make a good impression.#
HOSHI: Or reptiles.#
HOSHI: Start with the third one from the left. (He takes a big lighted rod and turns it upside down. Now it glows red.)#
HOSHI: The second from the right.#
HOSHI: I'm all right. The first one on the left is next.#
HOSHI: Number four. The fourth one from the left.#
HOSHI: Yes, yes. Number five is the last one after you disable the reactor.#
HOSHI: With all due respect to Phlox, I wouldn't miss this for the world.#
HOSHI: Strange.#
HOSHI: They're not responding.#
HOSHI: I've rotated through all the frequencies.#
HOSHI: I already tried.#
HOSHI: That was Winston Churchill. I picked that up half an hour ago.#
HOSHI: I've also intercepted several military dispatches and their radio programme, something called The Shadow.#
HOSHI: I've lost them.#
HOSHI: I'm picking up another signal. It's faint.#
HOSHI: Captain!#
HOSHI: Got 'em.#
HOSHI: I'm picking up a surge of radio chatter. Orders coming in German and English.#
HOSHI: So, what's the verdict? Am I going to live?#
HOSHI: I hope you're going to make it tonight.#
HOSHI: Madame Chang's. Don't tell me that you forgot.#
HOSHI: Wait. No, you've been talking about the egg-drop soup at this place for as long as I've known you.#
HOSHI: I spoke with Travis. What happened to you the other night?#
HOSHI: So you're going to stay aboard the ship because of some loudmouth in a bar?#
HOSHI: This isn't the way to deal with prejudice. The best thing is to show your face and remind people that there are aliens who don't want to blow up the planet.#
HOSHI: I'll bring you some take-out.#
HOSHI: The Borderland?#
HOSHI: Sorry I asked.#
HOSHI: We're cleared for launch.#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: The Klingons are requesting to dock.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI: There was a spike. Then the signal was gone.#
HOSHI: The sequence is coming up.#
HOSHI: Transmitting. Ten seconds to auto-destruct.#
HOSHI: It's some kind of feedback pulse. It's the signal we sent. It's being amplified a thousand percent. Comm.'s dead.#
HOSHI: They're opening their shuttlebay doors.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's Soong.#
HOSHI: It's been programmed with seven Klingon dialects.#
HOSHI: An automated beacon. It's very faint. It could be a distress signal.#
HOSHI: They're hailing us.#
HOSHI: They're closing. They're extending their docking port.#
HOSHI: Here! (She catches the ball but her shot is deflected to a stationary Phlox, who easily puts it through the hoop.)#
HOSHI: Time to switch sides again, Doctor.#
HOSHI: Should I try to get him back?#
HOSHI: They've been fired on. They took damage, but they're heading back to Enterprise.#
HOSHI: Three ships closing on our position. SATO: We're being hailed. It's Administrator V'Las.#
HOSHI: That one missed us by twenty metres.#
HOSHI: V'Las.#
HOSHI: Hull breach on C Deck. They're reporting casualties. V'Las is hailing. Audio only.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed.#
HOSHI: He's not in his quarters or anywhere on D deck.#
HOSHI: It's the particle flux in the nebula, it's overloading the sensors.#
HOSHI: It's the Vulcans. They'll be here in two hours. He's hailing us again.#
HOSHI: It's Shran.#
HOSHI: One of the Andorian ships is in trouble. Their reactor's been hit.#
HOSHI: The cruiser's breaking off its attack.#
HOSHI: Shran's hailing.#
HOSHI: Hull breach on G deck. We're venting atmosphere.#
HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's the High Command.#
HOSHI: I can't wait to get back.#
HOSHI: Sifting through a Klingon garbage dump. Not my idea of exploring strange new worlds.#
HOSHI: Not a chance, sir.#
HOSHI: And a latrine.#
HOSHI: Commander? What's wrong?!#
HOSHI: Shuttlepod One to Enterprise.#
HOSHI: Yes, sir. At least in simulations.#
HOSHI: Understood.#
HOSHI: Doctor, should we start with the bio-gel?#
HOSHI: Before Commander Tucker passed out, he started coughing.#
HOSHI: I'm not coughing anymore. Neither are you. Maybe we're getting better.#
HOSHI: Something for our symptoms.#
HOSHI: Strain of what?#
HOSHI: Let me guess. Doctor Andromeda builds a monster, and it kills him in the end.#
HOSHI: All your movies are the same. I can't keep the stories straight.#
HOSHI: I got kicked out.#
HOSHI: In my second month, I had a difference of opinion with the Company Commander. I broke his arm.#
HOSHI: Poker.#
HOSHI: He tried to shut down a game I was running for some of the recruits, and a couple of the training staff.#
HOSHI: The way the regulations are worded, gambling was an honour violation only if it took place during duty hours. So I ran the game on weekends. One night my C.C. showed up, tried to sweep all the chips off the table, and I. Well, I have a black belt in aikido. I think he was just upset that I hadn't invited him to play.#
HOSHI: I got a bad conduct discharge.#
HOSHI: Starfleet needed language specialists more than they needed to make an example out of me. They let me back in on probation, and here I am.#
HOSHI: That's not how it works. There are a lot of common patterns. I'm just good at hearing them, that's all.#
HOSHI: I wish I could fix warp engines with duct tape and a pocket knife.#
HOSHI: Seriously. Engineering, building things. have you always been good at that?#
HOSHI: How old were you?#
HOSHI: We didn't see you there.#
HOSHI: They both came to see us. Maybe that means they're almost finished.#
HOSHI: I was back in Brazil. The shuttle was coming to take me to Enterprise.#
HOSHI: Captain Archer needed me early. I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my students.#
HOSHI: Yo se que estoy atrasada. Enterprise no se va hasta manana. Solo necesito cinco minutos.#
HOSHI: Math is just another language. (The red light goes green, the door opens and alarms go off in the corridor.)#
HOSHI: Haye nuzhno skazat dosvidaniya.#
HOSHI: I need to tell them while there's still time.#
HOSHI: So am I.#
HOSHI: Because the desire to overcome it will spur them to move beyond the limitations of the physical world.#
HOSHI: It was true for us.#
HOSHI: Humans say they avoid it, but their words don't match.#
HOSHI: We're being observed.#
HOSHI: That is not our decision to make.#
HOSHI: We have to leave them as they are.#
HOSHI: Then we agree.#
HOSHI: Then how would we ever learn about you?#
HOSHI: Talking is a limited form of communication for us. We're much more advanced than humans.#
HOSHI: We're leaving now, Captain. You won't remember a thing about our presence. And in three hours, you'll die as well.#
HOSHI: Are you defying me?#
HOSHI: In time, we'll study other humans.#
HOSHI: The food on this ship isn't fit for animals! That mangy pet of yours would probably taste better. You can either take me home or find a new chef, it's that simple. Oh, something else. I want new quarters.#
HOSHI: For one thing, my room is too small. There are plasma conduits running across the ceiling. It's noisy, it keeps me up all night.#
HOSHI: What did you say to me?#
HOSHI: That was a nice touch.#
HOSHI: Tellarites always have a litany of complaints. It's how they start arguments with people they've just met.#
HOSHI: In that case, they'll just insult you. Whatever they say, you have to respond in kind. Otherwise, they'll take offense.#
HOSHI: Sir. I wasn't kidding about Porthos.#
HOSHI: No, but you might want to keep him out of sight. Tellarites consider canines something of a delicacy. Captain's starlog, November 12, 2154. We've arrived in orbit of Tellar Prime. Starfleet's ordered us to transport their ambassador to a neutral planet designated as Babel, where Earth mediators will try to settle a long-standing trade dispute between the Tellarites and the Andorians.#
HOSHI: We've picked up a message on an Andorian channel.#
HOSHI: That's it.#
HOSHI: They're not responding.#
HOSHI: Their shields are still at maximum.#
HOSHI: No response.#
HOSHI: Why would they need so many?#
HOSHI: Transporter's offline.#
HOSHI: Just the MACOs.#
HOSHI: Decompression on C deck, section three.#
HOSHI: They're still closing.#
HOSHI: They're holographic projectors. It's a camouflage system. They can use it to mimic the appearance of almost any ship.#
HOSHI: The Andorian tradition Shran wants to follow is called the Ushann. Basically, it's a duel to the death.#
HOSHI: It's an ice-miner's tool. Andorians play with them as children. A Tellarite won't stand a chance using one against Shran.#
HOSHI: What are you doing here?#
HOSHI: Barbaric, if you ask me.#
HOSHI: Code of the Ushann. T'Pol wants me to go over it again. See if I can find a way out of this mess.#
HOSHI: She wants me to find a loophole. Some way to forfeit without offending the Andorians.#
HOSHI: How does that help us?#
HOSHI: That rule only applies if he's married.#
HOSHI: Even if we could, something tells me the Andorians would cry foul. There are twelve thousand amendments to this ridiculous honour code. There has got to be one that can get him out of this.#
HOSHI: If the Captain wins, Shran's dead. The alliance falls apart.#
HOSHI: Not recently.#
HOSHI: How did he get out of it?#
HOSHI: Don't try and block with this. When he swings, intercept, deflect, and hook it away.#
HOSHI: We've got company, alliance ships.#
HOSHI: I'm glad we got here early.#
HOSHI: You didn't think Madame Chang's was going to be your little secret forever, did you?#
HOSHI: That's probably my fault. I told a few friends about the place.#
HOSHI: I'm a comm. officer. If there's one thing that I know how to do, it's disseminate information. You didn't tell me how your meeting went today at the IME.#
HOSHI: That's great. Are you going to accept?#
HOSHI: I'm the wrong person to ask. I've got a vested interest in keeping you around.#
HOSHI: I'm all right, sir.#
HOSHI: There were three men. They were in the shadows. I didn't get a good look at them.#
HOSHI: Right before I passed out. I'm pretty sure it wasn't English.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir.#
HOSHI: Nothing's happening.#
HOSHI:  Yes, perfectly.#
HOSHI:  I'm glad we got here early.#
HOSHI: There.#
HOSHI: Do you see them?#
HOSHI: Bring him with us. It's Rigelian.#
HOSHI: Still no response.#
HOSHI: We've been boarded. D deck, starboard side. Access tube seven.#
HOSHI: I have nothing to say to you, human.#
HOSHI: Klingon.#
HOSHI: What do you think?#
HOSHI: Is it unusual to have weird dreams after a mind meld?#
HOSHI: I had a bizarre dream last night. Commander Tucker was in it. We were in a strange place. It was all white. There was almost a romantic quality to it. I don't ever remember dreaming about Commander Tucker before.#
HOSHI: The memory core was wiped by that microdyne coupler.#
HOSHI: We found it in storage locker C fourteen. The last person to access that locker was Lieutenant Reed.#
HOSHI: The Klingons are jamming everything.#
HOSHI: I can't get through.#
HOSHI: Commander. I've broken through their jamming frequencies.#
HOSHI: They're responding. (The caller is green, wearing leather and with bits of metal on his head.)#
HOSHI: What've you got for a headache?#
HOSHI: A few hours. What is it?#
HOSHI: Is she all right?#
HOSHI: It's probably just stress.#
HOSHI: Or it could be our new passengers.#
HOSHI: I'm just not used to seeing guys trip over themselves like that.#
HOSHI: If you ask me, it's pumping a little too hard.#
HOSHI: Why?#
HOSHI: Phlox!#
HOSHI: I thought you just had one.#
HOSHI: They're not responding.#
HOSHI: He's hailing us.#
HOSHI: He's hailing.#
HOSHI: Don't listen.#
HOSHI: Captain!#
HOSHI:  What do you think you're doing?#
HOSHI: This is supposed to be your sanctuary. A place to get away from status reports.#
HOSHI: And probably the only one who doesn't want to slip a knife in your back. I heard the battle went well at Tau Ceti.#
HOSHI: Word on the ship is the war may be over soon. I'll go back to Brazil, start teaching again. You'll accept a comfortable desk job at Headquarters. We'll have the weekends.#
HOSHI: Forget about the war. This is our time.#
HOSHI: You didn't receive a communiqu� from Starfleet. I would have known if something came through. A mutiny. Didn't think you had it in you.#
HOSHI: Where's Captain Forrest?#
HOSHI: How do I know that you didn't push him out of an airlock?#
HOSHI: I want to talk to him.#
HOSHI: Is that all you need? You've never forgiven me for leaving. I'm sorry if I hurt you.#
HOSHI: Just as you did. You should've been Captain from the moment we left Spacedock. You've always known that. If it hadn't been for all those Admirals conspiring behind your back, Enterprise would have been yours. Tradition says that whatever belonged to the previous Captain is yours for the taking.#
HOSHI: It's demanding to be released.#
HOSHI: My people will find your ship and destroy it.#
HOSHI: Something about your maternal ancestor.#
HOSHI: I agree. I agree.#
HOSHI: The ship is in the Vintaak system at a facility orbiting the gas giant.#
HOSHI: It hasn't been that good in a long time. The things a girl will give up for her career.#
HOSHI: Of course. What was it?#
HOSHI: What's wrong?#
HOSHI: Well, it couldn't have been easy with T'Pol looking over his shoulder.#
HOSHI: What's going on?#
HOSHI: How did you learn all this?#
HOSHI: Another Terran Empire? Another Starfleet?#
HOSHI: I'm picking up a transmission. It's coming from Decon.#
HOSHI: Three ships are moving toward our position.#
HOSHI: One of the Tholian ships is hailing us.#
HOSHI: Four more ships.#
HOSHI: They're jamming us.#
HOSHI: No damage.#
HOSHI: They can see us.#
HOSHI: Hull plating's down. We've lost power on decks C, D and E.#
HOSHI: What do you think you're doing?#
HOSHI: Another Terran Empire, another Starfleet?#
HOSHI: What are you wearing?#
HOSHI: These people had some strange ideas about uniforms.#
HOSHI: A mention of what?#
HOSHI: No Empire?#
HOSHI:  The United Federation of Planets?#
HOSHI: What about us? Do we exist in this universe?#
HOSHI: At least she was remembered for something.#
HOSHI: Stop. I don't want to know.#
HOSHI: I don't care. Computer. Display file on Starfleet Officer Jonathan Archer.#
HOSHI: Son of famed warp specialist Henry Archer, Jonathan was appointed Captain of Starfleet's first warp five ship. His name is among the most recognised in the Federation. He earned an impressive list of commendations during his career. Historians called him the greatest explorer of the twenty second century. Two planets were named after him.#
HOSHI: Hey.#
HOSHI: Forget about him. Your future is just beginning. Can you imagine the look on the Emperor's face when he sees this ship? You'll be declared Hero of the Empire. Starfleet'll have to give you a command of your own.#
HOSHI:  Sir, I'm picking up a signal from inside the ship. I think it's the reptile.#
HOSHI: The frequency's scrambled.#
HOSHI: The translator matrix is tied in.#
HOSHI: He closed the channel.#
HOSHI: The Tellarite ship's opened fire. No damage.#
HOSHI: The Vulcan ship's trying to escape.#
HOSHI: The last Andorian ship is retreating.#
HOSHI: They'll come around.#
HOSHI: Maybe it's time to get rid of her, now that this ship's operational.#
HOSHI: All of them?#
HOSHI: I hope you're not planning on getting sick anytime soon. In case you haven't noticed, your doctor is an alien.#
HOSHI: I've never been the consort of an Emperor before. Is there anything I need to know?#
HOSHI: Save it, Commander. The schematics you downloaded. Where are they?#
HOSHI: Let's go.#
HOSHI: I was hoping you'd put up a fight.#
HOSHI: Commander Tucker told me I should give you a few pointers in that area. (T'Pol knocks her down and makes her escape, but the MACO recovers enough to shoot her in the back.) HOSHI: Bring her.#
HOSHI: There's no point in continuing. She's not going to talk. We should kill her.#
HOSHI: They've taken heavy damage.#
HOSHI: We'll lose all the data on our counterparts.#
HOSHI: It'll only take a day for the fleet to return to Earth. Do you think the commanders will support you?#
HOSHI: Are you all right? (She goes to the door and lets in Travis, who sees Archer trying to crawl. Hoshi kisses Travis. Archer dies.)#
HOSHI: Open a channel to Fleet Admiral Gardner.#
HOSHI: This is the Starship Defiant. If you don't surrender immediately, we'll begin targeting your cities. Respond.#
HOSHI:You're speaking with Empress Sato. Prepare to receive instructions.#
HOSHI: It's not about who gets credit.#
HOSHI: I just updated them with a few things we picked up on the mission.#
HOSHI: Hmm?  HOSHI: No word yet from Trip or T'Pol.#
HOSHI: Six of the universal translators started confusing Rigelian with Andorian. There's a glitch somewhere, but I can't find it.#
HOSHI: You accidentally triggered an ID protocol in the network. I tracked it back to the source.#
HOSHI: No response, sir.#
HOSHI: They're sending a subspace message on all frequencies.#
HOSHI: He's on every frequency. The signal's going system-wide.#
HOSHI: Everything's jammed.#
HOSHI: I won't hesitate, sir.#
HOSHI: I still do. I'm just better at hiding it.#
HOSHI: Understood.#
HOSHI: Paxton will need two minutes to power up the array before he can fire.#
HOSHI: It's enough.#
HOSHI: I won't destroy the array unless we have no other choice.#
HOSHI: I'm following orders.#
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir.#
HOSHI: Actually, I can only be relieved by a higher ranking officer in my chain of command.#
HOSHI: Belay that order. I won't risk exposing our position by breaking radio silence.#
HOSHI: I know what I'm doing.#
HOSHI: Take us in. Full impulse. Charge weapons.#
HOSHI: Standing by.#
HOSHI: They really want to postpone the conference?#
HOSHI: Excuse me, sir. Sato, go ahead.#
HOSHI: We're in the mess hall.#
HOSHI: No, I don't see him, sir.#
HOSHI: Wait here, sir.#
HOSHI: Samuels is in here. He's safe.#
