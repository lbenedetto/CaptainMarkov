[Shrine]
(The dark place is barely lit by a multitude of smoky candles and braziers.)
VULCAN MASTER: The Kol-Ut-Shan. A cornerstone of our beliefs. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. I know all about Vulcan philosophies. 
VULCAN MASTER: Why have you come here? 
YOUNG TUVOK: I was sent against my will. 
VULCAN MASTER: Then I suggest you leave. 
YOUNG TUVOK: I'm not a prisoner? 
VULCAN MASTER: Only of your emotions, or so I have been told. 
YOUNG TUVOK: My emotions free me. 
VULCAN MASTER: I see. It's regrettable that I won't be able to teach you. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Where should I go? 
VULCAN MASTER: Are you seeking my counsel? 
YOUNG TUVOK: I can't return home. My father's banished me. 
VULCAN MASTER: Your school? 
YOUNG TUVOK: They revoked my seat. 
VULCAN MASTER: Why? 
YOUNG TUVOK: Because I refused to deny myself passion, the way you and men like my father do. 
VULCAN MASTER: You reject logic. 
YOUNG TUVOK: If I was meant to deny feelings, why was I born with them? Where's the logic in that? 
VULCAN MASTER: Hidden for you to find. Or in plain sight for you to ignore. 
YOUNG TUVOK: You speak in riddles because the truth frightens you. 
VULCAN MASTER: You're right, it does frighten me. You are surprised to hear a Vulcan master admit to having emotions? 
YOUNG TUVOK: Yes. 
VULCAN MASTER: Emotions can be a powerful tool. To deny their existence is illogical. But you must learn to control them. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Why? 
VULCAN MASTER: You wish to be taught? 
YOUNG TUVOK: I would question everything you say. 
VULCAN MASTER: You would not be a worthy pupil otherwise. Let us begin. Sit down, Tuvok. 
[Shuttlecraft]
(On a red-soiled, rock strewn desert planet, a young woman hunts for large spiders. She sees a small spacecraft land, and goes to see what she can salvage. She is at the helm console when Paris returns. She points a weapon at him and shouts.) ; 
NOSS: Tu be veg! 
PARIS: Er, sorry? 
NOSS: Sen. Neeba sen. 
PARIS: Either the universal translator's offline, or I hit my head harder than I thought. 
NOSS: Ruk. 
PARIS: All right. Take it easy. All right, all right. Take it easy. 
NOSS: Fita! 
PARIS: This? Listen, I really need this. 
NOSS: Fita ur neeto. 
PARIS: Okay, okay. 
(He hands over his satchel and she leaves.)
PARIS: First day in town and I've already been mugged. 
[Planet surface]
(A second figure stalks Noss as she walks up a gully. Another jumps out in front of her and grabs her bags. She is overpowered, but before one can stab her, Tuvok grabs his arm. He knocks him out, and slams the second alien into the rock cliff. The first wakes, and gets a neck pinch.) 
TUVOK: I'm Commander Tuvok of the Starship Voyager. Tuvok. 
NOSS: Tuwok. 
TUVOK: Yes. And you? 
NOSS: Noss. 
TUVOK: Noss. 
(He holds out his hand and helps her to her feet.)
TUVOK: We'll go to my vessel. I see you've already been there. 
[Shuttle]
PARIS: Mayday, mayday. Paris to Voyager, Respond. Oh, come on. 
TUVOK: Her name is Noss. She was attacked by two humanoid males. 
PARIS: Sure she didn't attack them? 
TUVOK: They were attempting to rob her. 
PARIS: Seems to be a local pastime. 
TUVOK: She requires medical attention. 
PARIS: I'd love to help, but somebody stole our med-kits. 
(Tuvok returns them, and Paris sees to Noss' injuries..)
TUVOK: Food. What's the status of the shuttle? 
PARIS: Fractures throughout the hull, environmental systems down, impulse engines are beyond repair. Told you we should have brought the Delta Flyer. 
TUVOK: Communications appear to be functional. 
PARIS: It won't do us any good. Every time I transmit a signal, it gets bounced back by the distortion field that pulled us down here. It looks like we fell into some kind of gravity well. As far as I can tell, this planet is a part of an entire solar system that is stuck in a pocket of subspace. 
TUVOK: Fascinating. 
PARIS: Yeah. Well, scientific interest aside, I don't see any easy way out. 
TUVOK: No doubt Voyager has begun a rescue effort. The Doctor? 
PARIS: His mobile emitter was damaged during the crash. With a little luck, I might be able to repair it and bring him back online. 
TUVOK: Make it your top priority. 
NOSS: Gren, gren. 
PARIS: What is it? 
TUVOK: Thirteen humanoids approaching. The same species that attacked her. Gather as many supplies as you can carry. We're leaving. 
PARIS: You really think it's smart to abandon the shuttle? 
TUVOK: Noss appears to have survived here for some time. It's logical to assume she has access to a more secure shelter. 
NOSS: Nemok. Alen. Alen. 
PARIS: Whatever you say. 
[Planet surface]
(Noss leads them to a vantage point, then points at a large wrecked freighter.)
NOSS: Ai kan. 
[Noss's ship]
PARIS: Doesn't look like this bird's gonna fly either. 
TUVOK: Minimal power and life support, but the ship is protected by a forcefield. 
PARIS: That explains how she's been able to survive here. Anything resembling an engine? 
TUVOK: I'm detecting engine debris two kilometres away. It is of the same configuration as this vessel. 
PARIS: Great. We've got two unusable ships, and the only way Voyager is going to detect our distress call is if they crash land right on top of us. 
TUVOK: Progress? 
(Referring to the mobile emitter.)
PARIS: The optronic relays took heavy damage. I'm bypassing the primary circuits. Come on, Doc. I know you're in there. 
(The EMH solidifies.)
EMH: I'm guessing we hit a snag. 
TUVOK: An accurate assumption. 
NOSS: Rev den ut. Ut rev? 
EMH: Tun sank. Ton rev ut teem sayd. 
PARIS: You speak her language? 
EMH: A universal translator was written into my programme. 
PARIS: Ask her how long she's been here. If she knows a way to get back through that sinkhole. 
EMH: Deen ya tone ud la kar. Padeen nefka minruk? 
NOSS: Laka heen. Zen nik lurka. Irut tota. Maez bemrukaya. 
PARIS: What'd she say?;
EMH: She said she's been here fourteen seasons, and in that time, she's seen many ships come down. but she's never seen one go back up again. 
[Planet surface]
(Paris is learning the art of hunting large spiders. You place a gizmo on a large rock which irritates the creature enough to make it come out. Then you stab it with a three-pronged knife. That's the part Paris can't get the hang of.) 
PARIS: Come back, you little bloodsucker. 
(Noss laughs.) 
PARIS: I don't know what's worse, catching them or eating them. 
NOSS: No poison. 
PARIS: Well, hey may not be poisonous but they give me the creeps. Maybe I should have left the hunting to you and Tuvok. 
NOSS: Let me. Yah! 
(She gets one first time.)
PARIS: Looks delicious. 
[Noss's ship]
EMH: Shut down my programme? Why? 
TUVOK: Our resources are severely limited. We may need your mobile emitter as a source of power. 
EMH: I'm a Doctor, not a battery. 
TUVOK: Until we're rescued, or you are needed for an emergency, I must insist that you remain offline. 
PARIS: Make way for the mighty hunters. 
EMH: If Mister Paris' hunting ability is any indication, maybe we should take him offline. 
PARIS: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Doc. 
NOSS: The hunt was good. 
TUVOK: Impressive. 
(Later, whilst preparing dinner.)
TUVOK: Voyager has fifteen decks, a crew of one hundred fifty two, warp and impulse engines. 
NOSS: I want to see. 
TUVOK: Someday, perhaps. 
NOSS: Tell me about you there. 
TUVOK: I am the Chief Tactical Officer. 
NOSS: What else? 
TUVOK: Can you be more specific? 
NOSS: Your duties. Where you sleep. What you eat. Music. Friends. 
TUVOK: Why is any of that relevant? 
NOSS: Because it is you. 
(Later,; at dinner.)
PARIS: When I first met her, she wouldn't even look at me. But she warmed up after, oh, three years. 
EMH: The longest flirtation in Starfleet history. 
PARIS: No kidding. 
NOSS: She sounds fascinating. 
PARIS: I just hope I see her again. 
NOSS: You must really baiya jouton. 
EMH: Love her very much. 
PARIS: Yeah. 
NOSS: More spiders? 
PARIS: Oh, no, thank you. Three's my limit. 
TUVOK: I will assist you. 
EMH: Well, I suppose it's time I shut down my programme. 
PARIS: Good night, Doc. 
(And later still.)
PARIS: She likes you. 
TUVOK: She has been alone for many years. She appreciates our company. 
PARIS: No. I mean she likes you. 
TUVOK: What are you implying? 
PARIS: Oh, come on, Tuvok. You may be cold, but you're not blind. 
TUVOK: Need I remind you that I am married. 
PARIS: Your wife is fifty thousand light years away, in a different layer of space! The chances of you ever seeing her again are practically nonexistent. 
TUVOK: Excuse me. 
[Planet surface]
PARIS: What are you doing? 
TUVOK: I'm recalibrating the distress beacon. 
PARIS: Listen. What I said in there, about your wife. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. 
TUVOK: I have no feelings for you to hurt. 
PARIS: I think you do. You work hard to bury them, but they're there. And even if they're not, this is home now. You might as well accept it and try to find as much happiness as you can. Listen, you have a chance to make a decent life for yourself here. 
TUVOK: There is still a possibility that Voyager will rescue us. You may see Lieutenant Torres again. 
PARIS: If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were trying to cheer me up, Tuvok. 
TUVOK: Is there a point to your pessimism? 
PARIS: It's not pessimism, it's practicality. You of all people should understand that. Look, I've never met your wife but if she's half a logical as you are, I bet you she'd tell you the same thing. 
TUVOK: Your attempt to play matchmaker is misguided. I am not experiencing Pon farr. 
PARIS: What difference does it make? You obviously care about Noss. If you won't admit it to me, at least admit it to yourself. 
TUVOK: I respect her ability to survive. 
PARIS: It's more than that. I've seen the way you look at her. 
TUVOK: What way is that? 
PARIS: Like someone who wishes he wasn't Vulcan. 
[Shrine]
YOUNG TUVOK: I'm sorry I was born Vulcan. 
VULCAN MASTER: Bilak par. Self-pity. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Are you cataloguing my emotions? 
VULCAN MASTER: What is the source of your self-pity? 
YOUNG TUVOK: Isn't it obvious? If I weren't Vulcan, I wouldn't be here now going through this pointless ritual. 
VULCAN MASTER: You see only what is in front of you. You must learn to see behind you. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Another riddle. I have no eyes to see behind me. 
VULCAN MASTER: You have the eyes of memory. The knowledge of why you are here, and why you have lost control. Tell me your story. 
YOUNG TUVOK: My father's already explained it. 
VULCAN MASTER: I wish to hear it from you. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Her name's Jara. Her father's a Terrelian diplomat. She's been granted a seat at my school. 
VULCAN MASTER: And you have developed an emotional attraction toward her. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Yes. 
VULCAN MASTER: You love her. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Yes. 
VULCAN MASTER: Does she love you? 
YOUNG TUVOK: No. She's, Jara doesn't return my feelings. 
VULCAN MASTER: What if I were to say that I received a letter from your father, telling me that Jara is in love with one of your fellow students? 
YOUNG TUVOK: That's a lie! Who is it? 
VULCAN MASTER: Jealousy? 
YOUNG TUVOK: I'll challenge him. 
VULCAN MASTER: That would be illogical, because I have received no such letter. 
YOUNG TUVOK: You're trying to trick me. 
VULCAN MASTER: No. I'm trying to help you to understand. Shon-ha'lock, love, is the most dangerous emotion of all. It produces many other emotions. Jealousy, shame, rage, grief. You must learn to suppress them all, otherwise they will consume you. I can sense emotions building inside you like a gathering storm. If we begin now, we may be able to stop them. 
Captain's Log, supplemental. It's been over an hour since the shuttle disappeared from sensors. 
[Bridge]
TORRES: I'm not detecting any debris. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe the shuttle was tractored or transported somewhere. 
JANEWAY: Scan the region. Look for plasma emissions or EM displacements. Anything that might indicate another ship. 
KIM: Nothing out of the ordinary. Hydrogen, helium, space dust. 
JANEWAY: There has to be something out there. Shuttles don't just vanish into thin air. ;
(Whumph!)
TORRES: It's a gravimetric shear. 
JANEWAY: Source. 
KIM: Unknown. 
JANEWAY: Red alert. Helm, full ahead. 
KIM: We're caught in some kind of subspace sinkhole. It's pulling us in.
CHAKOTAY: The gravimetric shear is increasing. 
JANEWAY: Go to warp 
TORRES: I can't establish a field. 
JANEWAY: Then we need more power to the impulse engines. 
TORRES: That won't be enough. We've got to find a way to counter the gravitational pull. 
JANEWAY: B'Elanna, vent three million isodynes of plasma from the nacelles. Chakotay, reverse shield polarity. 
KIM: We're clear. 
JANEWAY: Move us away. Stand down red alert. Secure all stations. I'd say we have a pretty good idea what happened to that shuttle. 
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: The anomaly is approximately six hundred metres in diameter. 
TORRES: It's out of phase with normal space. Even after recalibrating the sensors, it barely registers. 
SEVEN: The distortion circumscribes a subspace zone that includes a Type G sun and three planets. 
CHAKOTAY: Any sign of the shuttle? 
SEVEN: No. 
CHAKOTAY: I'd say it's time to break out the multispatial probe. 
JANEWAY: Agreed. What the hell was that? 
SEVEN: A vessel approaching off the port bow. They've locked on a tractor beam. 
KIM [OC]: Captain to the bridge. 
[Bridge]
KIM: I'm only going to say this one more time. Disengage your tractor beam, sir. 
(The alien on the viewscreen is the same race as the ones who attacked Noss.)
YOST [on viewscreen]: You were in danger of being pulled into the distortion. You should show a little gratitude. 
KIM: We appreciate your help, but we didn't ask for. Captain, this is Mister Yost. 
YOST [on viewscreen]: Supervisor Yost, Renovation Team Nova. 
JANEWAY: Kathryn Janeway, of the Starship Voyager. 
YOST [on viewscreen]: Until tomorrow, I suggest you stay at least two million kilometres from the distortion. 
JANEWAY: What happens tomorrow? 
YOST [on viewscreen]: The rift will be closed by then. 
JANEWAY: Some of our crew are trapped inside. 
YOST [on viewscreen]: I am sorry. We have lost eleven ships to the distortion over the last year. It must be sealed. 
CHAKOTAY: What about your people? 
YOST [on viewscreen]: Even if there were survivors, there's no way to rescue them. The best we can do is to prevent others from being trapped. 
JANEWAY: We can't abandon our crew. If you could delay your mission 
YOST [on viewscreen]: My orders are to seal the rift by this time tomorrow. If you want to attempt a rescue between now and then, the risk is yours to take, but I wouldn't advise it.
(Transmission ends.) 
JANEWAY: Launch the probe. 
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Work with B'Elanna and Seven to enhance the sensors. Do whatever you can to find Tom and Tuvok. I'll be looking for a way to counter those gravitational forces. 
[Ready room]
JANEWAY: Come in. I've been brushing up on sinkholes, quantum singularities. 
CHAKOTAY: Any luck? 
;
JANEWAY: All the data leads me to the same conclusion. They're mono-directional phenomena. What goes in doesn't come out. 
CHAKOTAY: Well if it's any consolation, something's coming out of that anomaly. 
JANEWAY: What is it? 
CHAKOTAY: Telemetry from our probe. We've located the shuttle's distress beacon on a Class-D planet. 
JANEWAY: Vulcan, human, alien lifesigns. At least we know they're alive. 
CHAKOTAY: Keep reading. 
JANEWAY: There's astronomical data here covering a three month period. How is that possible? 
CHAKOTAY: There seems to be some sort of temporal differential. 
JANEWAY: How big a differential? 
CHAKOTAY: It's difficult to say, but every hour that passes for us could mean weeks, even months for Tom and Tuvok. 
JANEWAY: Months trying to survive in a Class-D environment? More than likely, they've assumed that we left them behind long ago. 
CHAKOTAY: Ready for the bad news? 
JANEWAY: You're kidding. 
CHAKOTAY: The gravitational stress is increasing. Seven believes the sinkhole is on the verge of collapse. When it does, everything inside will be crushed. 
[Noss's ship]
(Paris staggers in, carrying Tuvok.)
PARIS: Noss! 
(He activates the EMH.)
EMH: Medical tricorder. 
PARIS: We were ambushed. 
EMH: Give me twenty milligrams of inaprovaline. 
PARIS: They got away with a pair of resonator coils that we found. 
EMH: Three fractured ribs, subdural hematoma, internal bleeding. 
NOSS: Will he live? 
EMH: Vulcans are very resilient. He'll be fine. How long has it been since I was last activated? 
PARIS: Almost two months. 
EMH: Two months? So, what's new? 
PARIS: Oh, same old thing. Fighting off scavengers, hunting spiders. 
EMH: No word from Voyager? 
PARIS: They're probably three hundred light years closer to home by now. 
EMH: I think I should remain online until Mister Tuvok is fully recovered. 
PARIS: It's good to have you back, Doc. 
(Time passes.)
NOSS: Rest. 
TUVOK: How long was I unconscious? 
NOSS: Too many hours. 
TUVOK: Mister Paris? 
NOSS: He'll be fine. I was afraid. It is good to see your eyes. 
(Noss kisses Tuvok.)
TUVOK: Don't. 
NOSS: I only want to show you how I feel. You, you, you feel nothing for me? 
TUVOK: I told you, I don't experience emotion. I have developed an appreciation and respect for you. Nothing more. 
NOSS: Nothing? 
TUVOK: I am sorry. I cannot return your affection. 
NOSS: You cannot, or you will not? 
TUVOK: A minor distinction. 
NOSS: Logic! I hate logic! 
TUVOK: Your emotions will only exacerbate the situation. 
NOSS: Shevrot kat! 
TUVOK: Insulting me will not help. 
NOSS: Derot orat! 
{Ready room]
SEVEN: We can use the multispatial probe as a transporter relay. 
TORRES: It'll take a little time to reconfigure the targeting scanners but, with a little luck, it should work. 
JANEWAY: Any reason we can't use the same relay to send a comm. signal? 
TORRES: I don't see why not. 
JANEWAY: Good. Let them know that help is on the way.
KIM [OC]: Captain to the bridge. 
[Bridge]
KIM: They've started ahead of schedule. 
JANEWAY: Hail them. 
YOST [on viewscreen]: Yes? 
JANEWAY: It was my understanding you wouldn't begin for another six hours. 
YOST [on viewscreen]: We're ready now. 
JANEWAY: Well we're not. We need at least another two hours to make a rescue attempt. 
YOST [on viewscreen]: I'm sorry. 
(Transmission ends.)
JANEWAY: How long until they seal the rift? 
SEVEN: Approximately thirty minutes. 
JANEWAY: Then that's all we've got. 
[Planet surface - rock ledge]
(Tuvok is kneeling on an overhang.)
PARIS: Tuvok? Hey! 
TUVOK: I am meditating, Mister Paris. 
PARIS: I don't care. 
TUVOK: I trust there is an urgent reason for your lack of courtesy. 
PARIS: You're damn right there is. What did you say to her? 
TUVOK: Our conversation was private. 
PARIS: Well, whatever you said, she's talking about leaving. Going off by herself because it's too painful to be around you. 
TUVOK: She is under the influence of unfettered emotions. 
PARIS: Well, maybe you're able to fetter your emotions, but the rest of us don't have that luxury. She is a living, breathing woman who for reasons that I can't begin to fathom, has fallen in love with you. Now, if you're incapable of returning her feelings, at least show her some compassion. Try to let her down easy. 
TUVOK: There is no easy way to recover from infatuation. 
PARIS: Oh, really? And what do you know about infatuation? 
TUVOK: More than you might imagine. 
PARIS: Enlighten me. 
TUVOK: I have no intention of continuing this conversation any further. 
PARIS: Come on, Tuvok. Come on. It's just you, me and the rocks. 
(Tuvok stands up.)
TUVOK: When I was a young man, I experienced an emotional attraction toward a woman. It nearly destroyed me. 
PARIS: Your wife? 
TUVOK: No. Her name was Jara, a Terrelian female. I would have violated every tenet of Vulcan philosophy simply to be near her. 
PARIS: She must have really been something. 
TUVOK: I lost all sense of who I was. The emotional attraction I felt for her became a kind of insanity. 
PARIS: Tuvok, everyone feels a little insane when they fall in love, but it's worth the risk. 
TUVOK: For you, perhaps. But I am Vulcan. My natural emotions are erratic, volatile. If I don't control them, they will control me. 
PARIS: Whatever happened to Jara? 
TUVOK: I chose to leave her. I spent several months in isolation, studying with a Vulcan Master. I learned to suppress my emotions. 
PARIS: Too bad. 
(A whirlpool opens in the sky. Tuvok gets out his tricorder.)
TUVOK: Gravimetric distortions. 
PARIS: What's causing them? 
TUVOK: Unknown. 
[Bridge]
KIM: No response to our hails, Captain. 
SEVEN: At this rate, their anti-graviton beam will seal the distortion in approximately twenty nine minutes. 
JANEWAY: Transporter status? 
TORRES: I've completed the reconfiguration, but we're only going to be able to relay one transporter beam through the probe. 
CHAKOTAY: We'll have to get Tom and Tuvok within a two metre radius of the distress beacon. 
JANEWAY: Harry? 
KIM: I've opened a channel. 
JANEWAY: Voyager to away team. 
[Noss's ship]
PARIS: What is it? 
TUVOK: The distress beacon. We're receiving a transmission. 
PARIS: Can you route it through your comm. system? If I'm right, this message was sent almost nine hours ago on a very slow carrier wave. 
EMH: Can you speed it up? 
PARIS: I'll try. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Voyager to away team. A transporter beam with a radius of two metres will activate at the coordinates of your distress beacon in exactly thirty minutes. 
EMH: Thirty minutes? That would have been over eight hours ago! 
PARIS: Shh, there's more. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Be advised we've detected a temporal difference between our two positions. According to our calculations, the differential ratio is point four seven four four seconds per minute. Repeat. Voyager to away team. A transporter beam with a radius of two metres
TUVOK: According to that formula, thirty minutes would translate to two days, eleven hours and forty seven seconds. 
EMH: Well, we've waited this long. 
NOSS: Tom. 
(Aliens are massing for an attack. They detonate charges at the forcefield perimeter.)
TUVOK: The forcefield is holding. 
PARIS: Not for long if they keep pelting us with these photon grenades. 
EMH: How are we supposed to hold them off for two more days? 
[Bridge]
SEVEN: The rift will be sealed in less than two minutes. 
JANEWAY: Move us into range. Stand by for transport. 
TORRES: Yes, ma'am. 
[Noss's ship]
PARIS: The forcefield's losing power. Time? 
EMH: We still have another hour before transport. 
TUVOK: Where are you going? 
NOSS: To repair the field generator. 
TUVOK: I will accompany you. 
NOSS: No. You stay. Prepare for the attack. 
TUVOK: You can't go alone. 
NOSS: Risking two lives would be illogical. 
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: We're in transporter range. 
JANEWAY: Link up with the probe and relay the signal. 
TORRES: Stand by. I've got a lock on their beacon. 
JANEWAY: They're supposed to be ready for transport in thirty two seconds. Let's hope they don't stand us up. Begin twenty second countdown on my mark. Now. 
[Noss's ship]
EMH: We've got less than ten minutes to transport. 
PARIS: Where the hell is Noss? 
TUVOK: I'll find her. 
(Two aliens break down the forcefield and attack Noss.) 
[Bridge]
TORRES: Fifteen seconds. Fourteen. Thirteen. 
[Planet surface]
(Tuvok comes to Noss' rescue.)
NOSS: Tuvok. 
TUVOK: I could not leave you behind. 
[Bridge]
TORRES: Nine. Eight. Seven. 
[Noss's ship]
EMH: Now, Mister Paris! 
(An alien breaks in at attacks Paris. Tuvok shoots him in the back..)
PARIS: Hurry. 
[Bridge]
TORRES: Four. Three. Two. 
JANEWAY: Initialise transport sequence. Energise. 
[Transporter room]
KIM: We've got them. Welcome back. Who? 
TUVOK: A friend. 
Commander Tuvok, personal log, stardate 52438.9. We are en route to Noss' homeworld. As I prepare to say goodbye, I find myself experiencing a certain discomfort. 
[Corridor]
PARIS: Tuvok. Weird day. 
TUVOK: Problems? 
PARIS: I've spent the last two months wondering if I'd ever see B'Elanna again. As far as she's concerned, it's only been two days. I guess I expected her to have missed me, too. 
TUVOK: Were it not for the time differential, I'm sure she would have experienced a deep sense of loss. 
PARIS: You know something? I always thought that beneath that cold, Vulcan exterior lay a even colder Vulcan interior. Now, I'm convinced you're a hopeless romantic. 
TUVOK: There is no need to insult me, Mister Paris. 
[Transporter room]
NEELIX: Oh, here they are now. I was just getting Noss' recipe for saut�ed spiders. She told me how much you enjoyed them. 
PARIS: Let's just say it's an acquired taste. 
NOSS: Goodbye, Tom. (They hug.) Thank you. 
PARIS: Come on, Neelix. 
NEELIX: Oh, of course. 
PARIS: Crewman. 
(They leave Tuvok and Noss alone.)
NOSS: I'm sorry. 
TUVOK: For what? 
NOSS: I know how difficult this was for you. For us. I just wish things had been different. 
TUVOK: As do I. 
(Tuvok mind-melds with Noss. After a moment, she smiles.)
NOSS: I understand. Thank you. 
(Tuvok hands Noss up onto the transporter platform, then goes to the controls.)
TUVOK: Live long and prosper, Noss. 
NOSS: You too. 
(He beams her away.) 
[Shrine]
(Tuvok is meditating in his quarters, and remembering.)
VULCAN MASTER: Infinite diversity 
YOUNG TUVOK: In infinite combinations. 
VULCAN MASTER: Your training is now complete. You have done well. 
YOUNG TUVOK: Thank you. 
VULCAN MASTER: You are now prepared to return to the world. Grief, anger, fear, and especially love, will never threaten you again. 
YOUNG TUVOK: I am grateful.
