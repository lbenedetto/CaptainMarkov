The Voyager Transcripts - Dark Frontier
Dark Frontier
Stardate: 52619.2
Original Airdate: 17 February 1999
[Borg Probe Vessel]
BORG [OC]: A vessel has been detected. Unimatrix four two four grid one one six. Activate. Alter course to intercept. 
(Borg drones start to go about their business.)
BORG [OC]: Vessel identified. Federation Starfleet, Intrepid Class, one hundred forty three lifeforms. Prepare for assimilation. We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. 
JANEWAY [on monitor]: Break off your pursuit or we'll open fire. 
BORG [OC]: Irrelevant. 
JANEWAY [on monitor]: Is it? You've scanned our vessel. You know we can match your firepower. 
BORG [OC]: You will be assimilated. 
(They fire at Voyager, with no effect. Voyager returns fire, and makes things go Bang!)
BORG [OC]: Regenerate primary shield matrix. Remodulate weapons. 
(A photon torpedo is beamed inside the Borg vessel.)
BORG [OC]:  Security breach. Starfleet photon torpedo. Disarm weapon. 
(A drone opens the casing. KaBOOM!) 
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: I thought we were trying to disable it. 
SEVEN: The torpedo detonated near the power matrix. It caused a chain reaction. 
JANEWAY: Survivors?. 
TUVOK: None. 
JANEWAY: Debris status. 
KIM: There's a few components intact, but they're badly damaged. 
JANEWAY: Begin a salvage operation. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain? 
JANEWAY: There might be something we can use. Weapons, a transwarp coil. I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel lucky today. 
[Cargo Bay two]
(The savage operation has yielded lots of pieces.)
JANEWAY: Now, this is how I prefer the Borg. In pieces. 
CHAKOTAY: Eight kilotons of debris, most of it hull fragments. So far we've recovered two power nodes and a dozen plasma conduits, all in working order. 
JANEWAY: Their propulsion system, anything left? 
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna found a transwarp coil. 
(Janeway picks up a metal sphere.)
JANEWAY: It's lighter than I expected. It must be some kind of polytrinic alloy. Let's hope our little skirmish got back to the hive mind. Maybe they'll think twice before they attack us again. 
CHAKOTAY: It was only a probe. Next time, we might not be so lucky. 
KIM: Captain, don't touch that. 
JANEWAY: What is it? 
KIM: I don't know, but a few minutes ago it was crawling around the floor. I think it's some kind of auto-regeneration unit. 
JANEWAY: Thanks for the warning. By my count, we've added at least two years to our journey by avoiding the Borg. I'm tired of turning tail every time we detect a Cube. 
CHAKOTAY: Better safe than assimilated, 
JANEWAY: Mmm. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe I should go to red alert and get it over with. 
JANEWAY: Commander? 
CHAKOTAY: You're about to drop one of your bombshells. 
JANEWAY: Now what makes you say that? ;
CHAKOTAY: The way you fiddle with your com. badge. You do it every time. 
JANEWAY: Well, I'll have to keep an eye on that. 
EMH: Eureka! I was hoping to find one of these. It's a servo-armature from a medical repair drone. Laser scalpel, biomolecular scanner, micro-suture, all rolled into one instrument. 
PARIS: No Federation Sickbay should be without one. 
EMH: This could revolutionise the way that I perform surgery. 
JANEWAY: Excellent. Why don't you deactivate it for now? 
TORRES: Remodulate the coil frequency. 
SEVEN: No effect. 
TORRES: Try again. 
SEVEN: The field regulator is fused. 
CHAKOTAY: What seems to be the problem? 
TORRES: We can't activate the transwarp coil. 
SEVEN: When a Borg vessel is critically damaged, all of its vital technology self-destructs. The coil is beyond repair. 
CHAKOTAY: At least the Doctor found a new toy. 
SEVEN: Captain. Datanodes. One of them is a drone manifest, the other contains tactical information. 
CHAKOTAY: Specifically? 
SEVEN: Long range sensor telemetry, assimilation logistics and vessel movements for a radius of thirty light years. 
JANEWAY: Well, let's take a look. 
SEVEN: I'll need to convert the information to Starfleet parameters. 
JANEWAY: Time? 
SEVEN: Two hours. 
JANEWAY: Do it. 
[Mess hall]
PARIS: After nine hours staring at that debris, I was beginning to feel like a drone. 
KIM: I could use a shower. 
PARIS: Do Borg shower? Neelix, we need a couple of beers. 
NEELIX: Name your malt. 
PARIS: Ktarian. Replicate a pint for yourself, because we're going to toast the man of the hour. 
NEELIX: Oh? 
PARIS: It was Harry's idea to beam over a photon torpedo while they were remodulating their shields. 
KIM: I didn't think they'd fall for it. 
PARIS: Ah, but they did. Hook, line and sinker. Oh, I would have loved to have seen the look on their faces. Boom! 
KIM: To be honest, I wish the boom had been a bit smaller. We were only trying to disable them. 
(Seven enters.)
PARIS: They were drones, Harry. Mindless automatons. We did them a favour. 
KIM: Seven. 
PARIS: Look, I didn't mean anything by that. 
SEVEN: Your apology is irrelevant. It is impossible to offend a mindless drone.
(Neelix delivers the beers, which have massive foam heads on them.) 
PARIS: Cheers. 
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: I was able to recover sixty two percent of the data. This is an isogrid of Borg tactical movements across twenty five sectors. 
JANEWAY: Are there any dangers along our present course? 
SEVEN: There are three Cubes approximately nine light years away, travelling on a trajectory parallel to our own. They do not pose a threat. 
JANEWAY: What about that vessel? 
SEVEN: It's a scout ship, eight light years away, travelling at warp two. The ship is heavily damaged. 
TUVOK: Was it attacked? 
SEVEN: No. An ion storm. The Sphere is presently regenerating. That explains why it is travelling at low warp. 
JANEWAY: Limping home. 
SEVEN: In a manner of speaking. 
JANEWAY: I want a detailed schematic of this vessel, down to the power distribution nodes. I think we've just struck gold. 
[Briefing room]
JANEWAY: So what we have here in two simple words is, Fort Knox. 
TUVOK: Captain? 
JANEWAY: Tom, translate? 
PARIS: Fort Knox. The largest repository of gold bullion in Earth's history. Over fifty metric tons worth over nine trillion U.S. dollars. 
JANEWAY: Keep going. 
PARIS: Well, er, when the new world economy took shape in the late twenty second century and money went the way of the dinosaur, Fort Knox was turned into a museum. 
JANEWAY: And no one ever managed to break into that facility, right? 
PARIS: Well, a couple of Ferengi tried about ten years ago, but other than that, it's considered impenetrable. 
CHAKOTAY: Are you planning a heist? 
JANEWAY: As a matter of fact. Except we're not chasing gold. We're going to steal a transwarp coil. Think it might come in handy? 
TORRES: If I could equip our engines with even one coil, we could shave about twenty years off this trip. 
TUVOK: Do you believe the Borg sphere is damaged enough for us to penetrate its defences? 
JANEWAY: Long enough to take what we want and get out in one piece. but we'd have to plan this operation down to the millisecond. There would be no margin for error. As I see it, we plan an intercept course that won't attract their attention, then create a diversion to keep them occupied so we can send in an away team to obtain the technology. 
CHAKOTAY: I'd like to see the data on that Sphere. We might be able to recreate parts of it on the holodeck, run a few tactical simulations. 
JANEWAY: It's all yours. 
TORRES: We need to mask our warp signature. I've got a few Maquis tricks up my sleeve. They're not exactly Starfleet approved, but. 
JANEWAY: This is no time for protocol. Get started. The sphere is three days away by maximum warp. Set a course. Chakotay, I want an outline for our heist by tomorrow morning. We've proven ourselves against the Borg once before, twice before, but we're always the ones under attack. I think it's time to do a little assimilating of our own, hmm? Dismissed. 
[Ready room]
JANEWAY: I was hoping you'd be a little more vocal. Any thoughts? 
SEVEN: Your plan is ambitious. There are many variables. But it can succeed. 
JANEWAY: I'd like to narrow that list of variables. I was hoping your parents might provide us with a few insights. I've been looking over the records we found on the U.S.S. Raven. Your parents kept extensive field notes, detailed journals. There are over nine thousand log entries alone. 
SEVEN: The information is irrelevant. 
JANEWAY: On the contrary, Seven. They spent their careers studying the Borg. They tracked a cube at close range for what, two years? 
SEVEN: Three. 
JANEWAY: Well, I'd say that made them experts. I want you to study their research. Look for any data that might give us a tactical edge. 
SEVEN: My parents were assimilated. Obviously their tactics were flawed. 
JANEWAY: Look, these records have been collecting dust in our database for over a year. You say they're irrelevant, and I say you've been avoiding them. You're the best person for the job, but I'll assign it to Chakotay if I 
SEVEN: No. The information belongs to me. I will read it. 
[Cargo Bay two]
(Neelix brings in a case of PADDs.)
SEVEN: You're late. 
NEELIX: Sorry. It took longer than I expected to download these records. This is only the first batch. Your parents sure had a lot to say. I organised the information by category. Field notes, personal logs, biokinetic analyses. I don't mean to pry, but is it true your parents were studying the Borg? 
SEVEN: Yes. The Hansens were exobiologists. 
NEELIX: Fascinating. They must have been very courageous. 
SEVEN: They were misguided. 
NEELIX: A faded holo-image. That's all I've got left of my family. A picture of my sister. Except, of course, what I keep in here. (his heart) What I wouldn't give for a treasure trove like this. Well, I'd better get started on the rest of those files. 
(Neelix leaves. Seven takes the first PADD.)
MAGNUS [OC]: Field notes, U.S.S. Raven, Stardate 32611.4. It's about time. The Federation Council on Exobiology has given us final approval. Starfleet's still concerned about security issues but they've agreed not to stand in our way. We've said our goodbyes, and we're ready to start chasing our theories about the Borg. 
[Annika's room]
(Little Annika is playing with a model of a Borg Cube.)
ANNIKA: Zoom, zoom. 
MAGNUS: Ah, ah, ah, put down the cube, Muffin. It's not a toy. 
ANNIKA: I won't crash it. 
MAGNUS: Come here, Daddy wants to talk to you. Now, remember when I said that you, me and Mommy were going on a very long voyage? 
ANNIKA: Ah ha. 
MAGNUS: Well, we're leaving tomorrow and we won't see Earth for quite a while. 
ANNIKA: Are we going to see the Borg? 
MAGNUS: If we're lucky. 
ANNIKA: Do the Borg have kids, too? 
MAGNUS: Nobody knows. We'll be the first humans to study them up close. 
ANNIKA: What do they look like? 
MAGNUS: We're not sure exactly, but we think they might look a lot like us, but with technology inside their bodies. 
ANNIKA: Cy-ber-netic? 
MAGNUS: Mmm hmm.
ANNIKA: Are they friendly? 
MAGNUS: Well, they're different. They don't talk like us, or even think like us, but we're hoping to make friends one day. 
ANNIKA: I hope so, too, Daddy. 
MAGNUS [OC]: Field notes, U.S.S. Raven, Stardate 32623.5: we've been tracking stray readings for nearly eight months now, but there's still no sign of a vessel. I'm beginning to wonder if the Borg are nothing more than rumour and sensor echoes. 
[USS Raven - Bridge]
ERIN: Magnus. 
MAGNUS: We have to keep moving. If we take the replicators offline and run environmental systems at half power, we can go another twenty light years before refuelling. 
ERIN: We should refuel now. The nearest dilithium is in an asteroid field just ten days from here. 
MAGNUS: That's ten days we can't afford to lose. We're getting close. If we stop now, we might as well just turn around and go home. 
ERIN: Home, to what? We have deviated from our flight plan, crossed the Neutral Zone, disobeyed a direct order to return. Our colleagues obviously think we are insane. We have burned our bridges, Magnus. 
(Annika enters.)
ANNIKA: I can't sleep. 
MAGNUS: Come here. Why can't Annika sleep? The greatest scientific mystery of our time. 
ERIN: I have a hypothesis. Her noisy parents are keeping her up. 
MAGNUS: Hmm. Sounds plausible. ;
(Beep, beep.)
ERIN: Tri-quantum waves, six hundred thousand kilometres off the port bow. 
MAGNUS: Subspace disruptions, field magnitude two point nine teracochranes and rising. Annika, bed. 
ERIN: Power utilisation curve is highly symmetric.
MAGNUS: Artificial source probability point nine eight. (to Annika) Now. It's got to be a transwarp conduit. Nothing else could generate these readings. I'm taking us closer. 
ERIN: It's a Borg Cube, two thousand kilometres starboard. 
MAGNUS: I've got a visual. 
ERIN: It's massive. Twenty eight cubic kilometres, hundred and twenty nine thousand lifeforms on board. We're being scanned. They haven't altered course. 
MAGNUS: This could prove our theory. They ignore any lifeform until they consider it a threat, or a target. They're moving off. 
ERIN: Let's match their course and speed. Keep a distance of five million kilometres. 
[Cargo Bay two]
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Seven of Nine to the bridge. 
;
SEVEN: On my way. 
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Have we been detected? 
KIM: No, ma'am. 
TUVOK: I have a visual. 
JANEWAY: On screen. Magnify. 
(The Borg Sphere has bits missing.)
CHAKOTAY: Looks like they took a real beating. 
JANEWAY: They could still pose a threat. Let's not get too close. Match their course and speed. Keep a distance of ten million kilometres. ;
(Seven enters.)
PARIS: Aye, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Seven, scan the vessel. I want to know their current status. 
SEVEN: Their weapons array is regenerating, but shields and transwarp drive are still offline. 
JANEWAY: How long until they have transwarp? 
SEVEN: Approximately seventy two hours.;
JANEWAY: We may not get this opportunity again, and I don't intend to miss it. Whatever it takes, double shifts, round the clock simulations, I want to be ready. 
(Seven is walking through the Borg Sphere carrying a pattern enhancer, and Janeway is behind her with a phaser rifle. Tuvok and Kim are another team. The clock is down to 1:36 and counting.)
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to away teams. You're six seconds behind schedule. 
[Borg Sphere]
TUVOK: We are at the shield matrix. Stand by. 
KIM: The primary shield generator. I've got it. 
TUVOK: Spatial charges. Here, there and there. 
(Seven and Janeway arrive at their target.) 
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: You've got fifty five seconds. 
[Borg Sphere]
TUVOK: Tuvok to Janeway. Charges set. We're returning to the transport coordinates.
SEVEN: The transwarp coil is offline. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok, now.
TUVOK: Activate the charges.
JANEWAY: Bridge, their shields are down. Energise. 
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: Tom? 
PARIS: I've got a lock. 
[Borg Sphere]
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Target obtained. 
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: You're out of time. 
[Borg Sphere]
(Tuvok shoots one Borg, Kim another. But when it is Janeway's turn, the phaser rifle has no effect.)
JANEWAY: They've adapted. This way. (Seven doesn't move.) Seven! 
(Tuvok spots Janeway and Seven approaching.)
TUVOK: Bridge, stand by for transport. 
KIM: Hurry! 
TUVOK: Energise. 
[Bridge]
PARIS: I've got them. Transporter room one. 
(Three Borg arrive on the bridge.)
CHAKOTAY: Beam them out of here. 
PARIS: I can't get a lock. They've adapted to our transport frequencies. 
CHAKOTAY: Computer, freeze programme, both holodecks. What happened? 
PARIS: They tapped into our transporter beam. 
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to holodeck two. We got the transwarp coil 
[Holodeck - Transporter room]
CHAKOTAY [OC]: But we also picked up some uninvited guests. 
JANEWAY: What was our time? 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Two minutes twelve seconds. 
JANEWAY: Twelve seconds too late. Once we disable their sensor grid we only have two minutes until it regenerates. 
[Holodeck - Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: Did you run into any problems? 
[Holodeck - Transporter room]
TUVOK: None. 
SEVEN: We were efficient. 
KIM: What if we beam directly into the transwarp chamber? 
JANEWAY: There's too much shielding. 
TUVOK: Perhaps we could modify our transporters? 
JANEWAY: I've already explored that option. It won't work.;
KIM: Twelve seconds. Might as well be an eternity. 
SEVEN: The Hansens. They were able to remain inside a Borg cube for several hours without being detected. 
KIM: How? 
SEVEN: I'm not certain. 
JANEWAY: Well, keep investigating. 
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. 
JANEWAY: We've run enough simulations for one day. Let's work on refining our tactics, anything we can do to shave a few more seconds off our little heist. Computer, end programme. 
[Corridor]
JANEWAY: I don't know about you but I�m glad to be back on Voyager. Borg vessels make my skin crawl. 
SEVEN: It was a holodeck recreation. 
JANEWAY: Close enough. We just spent the last three hours dodging drones. It didn't bother you? 
SEVEN: Your point. 
JANEWAY: You seemed a little nervous in there. 
SEVEN: The last time I was on a Borg vessel, I was a drone. The recreation was unsettling. 
JANEWAY: You were reluctant to look at your parents' research and now I sense you're a little reluctant to go on this mission. Maybe I�m pushing you too fast. 
SEVEN: I'll adapt. 
JANEWAY: It's easier said than done. It's been over two years since you came face to face with the Collective. Are you sure you're up to it? I need everybody working at peak efficiency. 
SEVEN: You doubt my ability to function. 
JANEWAY: No, I�m simply voicing my concerns. 
SEVEN: They are unjustified. 
JANEWAY: I hope so, because the next time we won't be on the holodeck. 
SEVEN: Understood. 
[Cargo Bay two]
(Seven opens another box of PADDs. She gets a visitor.)
SEVEN: Naomi Wildman. 
NAOMI: I had a bad dream. Can I stay with you for a while? 
SEVEN: Where is your mother? 
NAOMI: She's working in Engineering, and Neelix is on a duty shift. Please? I won't bother you. 
SEVEN: Very well. 
NAOMI: It looked just like this. 
SEVEN: What did? 
NAOMI: In my dream. There was Borg stuff everywhere. 
SEVEN: Elaborate. 
NAOMI: I went on the mission. The one my Mom told me about, the Borg Sphere? But it didn't work. Everybody got assimilated. 
SEVEN: Nightmares are caused by irrational fear. They're not real. They can't damage you. Try to ignore it. 
NAOMI: Mom said we're going to steal something. 
SEVEN: A transwarp coil. 
NAOMI: Will you be on the Sphere? 
SEVEN: Yes. 
NAOMI: Are you scared? 
SEVEN: We will succeed. 
NAOMI: But what if you don't? What if they make you a drone again? 
SEVEN: Naomi Wildman, you agreed not to bother me. 
NAOMI: What's it like to be a drone? Does it hurt? 
SEVEN: You will terminate this line of questioning. 
NAOMI: Do the Borg have kids? What do they look like? Are they friendly? 
SEVEN: Return to your quarters immediately. 
NAOMI: Resistance is futile. 
(A Borg node pops out of Naomi's face. A drone steps out of a regeneration chamber.)
SEVEN: Seven of Nine to Security. Intruder alert. 
QUEEN [OC]: They can't hear you. 
SEVEN: Who are you? 
QUEEN [OC]: I am the Borg. Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one, you've become weak. 
SEVEN: This is a dream. I�m regenerating. 
QUEEN [OC]: It's not a dream. We've accessed your neural transceiver. Our thoughts are one. We know about Voyager's plan to invade the Sphere. It will fail. 
SEVEN: If that's true, then why haven't you assimilated them? 
QUEEN [OC]: We've come to make you an offer. Rejoin the Collective and we'll spare Voyager. 
SEVEN: Why me? 
QUEEN [OC]: Because you are unique. 
MAGNUS [OC]: Field notes, U.S.S. Raven, Stardate 32629.4: after three months of tracking our Borg cube, the vessel entered a transwarp conduit. We followed in its wake. Our sensors tell us we've travelled all the way to the Delta quadrant, the Borg's native territory. 
[USS Raven - Bridge]
ERIN: Magnus, you're breaking up. 
MAGNUS [on monitor]: Just some bio-electric interference. Stand by. Is that better? 
ERIN: Much. How's Junior? 
[Borg Cube]
MAGNUS: He took a real beating when that plasma conduit blew out. He's regenerating. Wait a minute, something's happening. Bill and Needle Fingers just arrived. This is odd. They're making repairs to Junior. 
[USS Raven - Bridge]
ERIN: I thought drones from different subunits didn't interact. 
MAGNUS [OC]: Looks like we were wrong. 
[Borg Cube]
(Junior falls to the deck.)
MAGNUS: They deactivated him. 
ERIN [OC]: Why? 
MAGNUS: Maybe he was too badly damaged. They're dismantling him. They must be salvaging the components. 
[USS Raven - Bridge]
ERIN: Your bio-dampener is losing power. It's time to come home. 
MAGNUS [OC]: I've got another minute or so. Stand by. 
[Borg Cube]
MAGNUS: We may not get another chance to observe this behaviour. 
[Medical lab]
SEVEN: It prevented the Borg from detecting them. They referred to it as a bio-dampener. The device creates a field around the body, which simulates the physiometric conditions within a Borg vessel. 
TUVOK: Camouflage. 
SEVEN: Precisely. 
TUVOK: We need four of these devices. How soon can you replicate them? 
EMH: I'll have to tailor each unit to its user's physiology. A few hours at least. 
TUVOK: Begin immediately. I'll inform the Captain. 
EMH: Ingenious design. 
SEVEN: The Hansens were resourceful. 
EMH: Sounds like you're warming up to your folks. 
SEVEN: It was merely an observation. 
EMH: This is an important stage of your social development, Seven. Try not to think of it as simply a research project, but as an exploration of how you were raised. 
SEVEN: My parents underestimated the Collective. They were destroyed. Because of their arrogance, I was raised by Borg. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Operation Fort Knox is ready to proceed. All departments are standing by and I've given the order to begin at oh six hundred hours. 
[Ready room]
JANEWAY: Coffee? You look like you could use some. 
SEVEN: No. 
JANEWAY: It's a human vice you might want to try one day. Keeps you sharp. 
SEVEN: One day. 
JANEWAY: I've been fine-tuning our game plan for tomorrow morning, and I've decided to reassign you to the bridge. 
SEVEN: Captain? 
JANEWAY: I'm concerned about Voyager's safety, and if the Sphere decides to attack I'll need your expertise at Tactical. 
SEVEN: I should be on the away team. 
JANEWAY: B'Elanna will do just fine in your place. 
SEVEN: You may encounter unexpected obstacles. Forcefields, encryption codes. I'm the only member of this crew who can anticipate them. 
JANEWAY: You underestimate the rest of us. 
SEVEN: And you underestimate the Borg. 
JANEWAY: This is more than just a question of tactics. I'm concerned about your well-being, and your ability to perform on this mission. 
SEVEN: Your concern is unwarranted. 
JANEWAY: Is it? I'm not the only one who's worried about you. Chakotay, Neelix, the Doctor, we've all noticed changes in your behaviour. You are preoccupied, agitated, and you're making mistakes. Don't get me wrong. I appreciate your efforts, and we couldn't have come this far without your help, but it's obviously taken its toll. If I'd realised how those journals were going to affect you, I never would have pushed you to read them. And I'm not about to ask you to face the Collective in your present frame of mind. 
SEVEN: The past several days have been difficult. But I must join the away team, and I assure you I will not make another mistake. 
JANEWAY: I've made my decision, Seven. 
SEVEN: If I don't go, this mission will fail. 
JANEWAY: You sound awfully certain about that. 
SEVEN: I know the Borg. 
JANEWAY: And I know you. There's more to what you're saying. What's wrong? 
SEVEN: Over the past two years, I have become familiar with the individuals on this vessel. Voyager is my Collective now. Your survival is important to me. I am willing to risk my own well-being if it increases our chances of success. Assign me to the away team. Please. (Janeway nods.) Thank you. 
JANEWAY: Seven. You've made remarkable progress as an individual and as a member of this crew. For what it's worth, Voyager wouldn't be the same without you. 
BORG [OC]: A vessel has been detected. Unimatrix four two four grid zero three. Activate. 
[Borg Sphere]
BORG [OC]: Vessel identified. Federation Starfleet, class two shuttlecraft. Three lifeforms. 
[Bridge]
TORRES: The Sphere is maintaining course. 
CHAKOTAY: Move the shuttle in closer. 
PARIS: The Borg are still ignoring it. 
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Transporter room two. 
[Transporter Room]
CHAKOTAY [OC]: They're not taking the bait. 
JANEWAY: Shuttle status? 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: All systems go. False bioreadings are holding steady. 
KIM: How about a phaser shot across their bow. Might grab their attention. 
SEVEN: No. The shuttle would be perceived as a threat and they'd destroy it. 
JANEWAY: Commander, increase the energy output of the shuttle's warp profile. 
[Bridge]
JANEWAY [OC]: That should present a more inviting target.
[Borg Sphere]
BORG [OC]: Warp signature detected. Prepare for assimilation. Relevant technology. Engage tractor pulse. 
[Bridge]
PARIS: They've got it. They're pulling it in toward a docking port along the central radius. Five hundred metres, two hundred. They're dropping shields. 
CHAKOTAY: Energise. 
TORRES: They're in. 
EMH: Bio-dampeners are stable. They're as good as invisible. 
CHAKOTAY: The Sphere? 
TORRES: The shields are back up. They're assimilating the shuttle. 
CHAKOTAY: Keep a sensor lock on the away team. Maintain course. 
[Borg Sphere]
(Seven is given an image of herself as a Borg in a regeneration chamber.)
QUEEN [OC]: Never forget who you are. 
JANEWAY: Seven, are you all right? 
SEVEN: Proceed.
KIM: Primary shield generator. Got it. 
TUVOK: Spatial charges here, there and there. 
(Janeway and Seven arrive at the transwarp coil.) 
TUVOK: Tuvok to Janeway, charges set. Returning to transport coordinates.
SEVEN: The transwarp coil is offline. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok, now.
TUVOK: Activate the charges. 
[Bridge]
PARIS: Their shields are down. 
CHAKOTAY: Lock onto the coil and energise. 
[Borg Sphere]
(Seven watches the coil being beamed away.)
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Target obtained.;
QUEEN [OC]: Seven of Nine. 
JANEWAY: Seven, keep moving! 
SEVEN: No. I wish to stay. I intend to rejoin the Collective. 
JANEWAY: I can't let you do that. 
SEVEN: You have no choice. 
JANEWAY: Keep moving. That's an order. 
(A forcefield flickers into existence between Janeway and Seven.)
SEVEN: Go! 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay to away team. 
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: The sphere has detected Voyager. They've altered course to intercept and they're charging weapons. We've got to get you out of there now. 
PARIS: Four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. 
CHAKOTAY: Full power to weapons. 
[Borg Sphere]
JANEWAY: I'm not leaving without you. 
SEVEN: Then you will be assimilated. 
(Janeway shoots an approaching drone, then runs. Two drones flank Seven.)
TUVOK: They can see us. 
KIM: How? 
TUVOK: I don't know. 
JANEWAY: Bridge, we're in position. Three to beam up. 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Three? 
JANEWAY: Energise. 
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: Where's Seven? 
JANEWAY: She had a change of heart. Report. 
CHAKOTAY: The Sphere's changing course. They're retreating. 
TORRES: They're bringing the remaining transwarp coils online. 
JANEWAY: Pursuit course. Target their propulsion system. 
PARIS: They're gone, Captain. 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
(The Sphere comes out of transwarp and flies inside a giant spacestation. Seven is escorted to a large central chamber. A platform is lowered which contains the head, shoulders and spinal cord of a Borg female, but without cybernetic implants except for tubes and a unit growing out of the back of its head. The rest of the body is assembled to receive it. It flexes its shoulders and steps out to touch Seven's face.) 
QUEEN: Welcome home. You've changed. Your exo-plating, your ocular implant. They've taken you apart and they've re-created you in their own image. Hair, garments, but at the core you are still mine. 
SEVEN: The Borg have changed as well. I expected re-assimilation, not conversation. 
QUEEN: I see they've also given you a sense of humour. 
SEVEN: My humour is my own. 
QUEEN: Spoken like a true individual. The last two years must have been a remarkable experience. You are unique. 
SEVEN: My experience will add to your perfection. 
QUEEN: Yes. 
SEVEN: That is why you removed me from Voyager. 
QUEEN: That is why we put you there in the first place. You believe that Voyager liberated you from the Collective. Did you really think we would surrender you so easily? 
SEVEN: Explain. 
QUEEN: You must be tired. It's time to regenerate. We've adapted an alcove just for you. Go. It will help order your thoughts. When your cycle is complete we will continue our conversation. Comply.
[Engineering]
JANEWAY: Progress?
TORRES: We were having trouble modulating the coil to our warp field. But I had an inspiration this morning. Instead of trying to adapt the coil to our technology, we should be adapting our systems to theirs. With any luck, we should have transwarp capability by oh six hundred. 
JANEWAY: Impressive. 
TORRES: Actually, I can't take all the credit. I did some digging in Seven of Nine's personal database and I found some designs she'd been working on to enhance the warp drive. With a few adjustments
JANEWAY: Work with Mister Paris on a flight plan. I want to make our first trial run tomorrow afternoon. 
TORRES: Right.
JANEWAY: And B'Elanna? Don't access personal databases without my authorisation.
TORRES: Captain?
JANEWAY: There are protocols for observing privacy on this ship.
TORRES: No offence, but Seven of Nine is not on this ship anymore.
JANEWAY: I realise the two of you weren't exactly close. Regardless, we've just lost one of our own.
TORRES: She was never one of our own, Captain. Didn't she just prove that?
JANEWAY: I don't know what happened on that sphere and neither do you, Lieutenant. Carry on. 
[Cargo Bay two]
CHAKOTAY: No sign of Borg activity. We made a clean getaway. 
JANEWAY: The Sphere? 
CHAKOTAY: It hasn't shown up on long range sensors or subspace telemetry. It could be anywhere in the quadrant by now. 
JANEWAY: Launch a class five probe. Scan for residual transwarp signatures. 
CHAKOTAY: Understood. 
JANEWAY: Why choose this moment to rejoin the Collective? 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe she'd been planning it all along. 
JANEWAY: She's had any number of opportunities to leave before now. 
CHAKOTAY: But never direct access to a Borg vessel. I will betray you. That's what she said two years ago when you disconnected her from the hive. 
JANEWAY: Two days ago, she told me Voyager had become her Collective. 
NEELIX: Captain, we've cleared out most of the debris, but before we vaporise it I'd like to melt down the larger fragments and extract the polytrinic compounds. 
JANEWAY: Makes sense. 
NEELIX: That leaves just one item, Seven of Nine's alcove. It requires a lot of power, over thirty megawatts. Should I deactivate it? 
JANEWAY: No, leave it alone. 
[Ready room]
JANEWAY: Computer, isolate the sensor readings for time index one one four point six. Identify source. 
COMPUTER: Random subspace energy fluctuations. 
JANEWAY: Isolate the sensor readings for time index one six six point two. Source? 
COMPUTER: Random subspace energy fluctuations. 
JANEWAY: Computer, run a transpectral analysis on all subspace fluctuations. (doorbell) Yes? 
TUVOK: A member of the crew has requested an appointment with the Captain. I informed her that you were occupied, but she was insistent. 
JANEWAY: Whatever it is, I'm sure Commander Chakotay can handle 
(Then she sees Naomi peeking out from behind Tuvok.)
JANEWAY: Request granted. Send her in. 
(Tuvok leaves them.)
NAOMI: Permission to submit a proposal for your review. 
JANEWAY: Proposal? 
NAOMI: It's a rescue operation for Seven of Nine. 
JANEWAY: Oh. You created this plan all by yourself? 
NAOMI: Yes, ma'am. You see, if we change our long range sensors to Seven's cortical implant frequency maybe we can find her. 
JANEWAY: The Delta Quadrant is a very big place, and Seven could be thousands of light years from here. 
NAOMI: What if we boosted our sensor range with power from the main deflector? 
JANEWAY: You've been spending too much time in Engineering. I'm afraid it's not quite that simple. But thank you, Crewman. Your initiative is duly noted. 
NAOMI: Captain? You're not going to give up, are you? 
JANEWAY: There are three things to remember about being a Starship Captain. Keep your shirt tucked in, go down with the ship, and never abandon a member of your crew. 
COMPUTER: Transpectral analysis complete. 
JANEWAY: Take a look at this, Naomi. What do you see? 
NAOMI: Sensor logs. 
JANEWAY: These aren't random energy fluctuations. They're Borg comm. signals, and they were all directed at Cargo Bay two. 
NAOMI: You mean the Borg were talking to Seven of Nine? 
JANEWAY: It sure looks that way. Come on. 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
QUEEN: Good morning. 
SEVEN: My visual cortex. It's been altered. 
QUEEN: We've enhanced it with Borg technology. You've seen through human eyes long enough. It's a neural processing adjunct designed to increase your synaptic efficiency. 
SEVEN: Remove it. 
QUEEN: You prefer to remain small? 
SEVEN: I prefer to remain unique. 
QUEEN: Don't be afraid. We won't turn you into a drone. You're much too valuable to us with your individuality intact. But you've left humanity behind. Try to abandon their petty emotions as well. Fear, anger, vanity. They've corrupted you, but the damage can be repaired. 
SEVEN: You've expended significant resources to capture me. Why? 
QUEEN: Isn't it obvious? You're going to help us assimilate humanity. We failed in our first attempt to assimilate Earth, and we won't succeed the next time unless we understand the nature of their resistance. We want you to be our eyes. Let us see humanity. 
SEVEN: While I was regenerating, you assimilated my memories. 
QUEEN: Our thoughts are one. 
SEVEN: Then you already possess all of my knowledge. What more do you want? 
QUEEN: You are the only Borg that has ever returned to a state of individuality. We want to keep you exactly the way you are. Otherwise you would lose your human perspective. We don't want another drone. We want you. 
SEVEN: I will resist. 
QUEEN: I know. 
(Rumble)
SEVEN: What's happening? 
QUEEN: Our vessel is disengaging from the Unicomplex. We're setting a course for grid five three two. 
SEVEN: State our purpose. 
QUEEN: Assimilation. Our presence is not required, but I thought the experience would be a rewarding one for you. Species one zero zero two six. 
SEVEN: How many lifeforms? 
QUEEN: Three hundred ninety two thousand. You're experiencing compassion. A human impulse. You've forgotten what it means to be Borg. Those lives will be added to our own. 
MAGNUS [OC]: Field notes, U.S.S. Raven, supplemental. It's been a busy week. The cube linked with another Borg vessel and received over fifty thousand new drones. We now begin the dangerous task of identifying the newcomers. 
[USS Raven - lab]
(They have brought a drone onto their ship.)
ERIN: Species six nine six one, Ktarian. Tritanium infrastructure. He's a tactical drone. 
MAGNUS: Take a look at his proximity transceiver. Let's check his previous designation. 
ERIN: Three of five, Tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix one. 
MAGNUS: I want to keep an eye on this one. Let's tag him. Bring me the subdermal probe, will you? 
ANNIKA: Is he special? 
MAGNUS: Very special. We think he used to work near the Borg Queen. If he ever goes back there, we'll be able to track him now. 
ANNIKA: Does the Queen have a throne? 
MAGNUS: Nobody knows. 
ERIN: We think she's more like the Queen of an insect colony. She helps coordinate all the other drones. 
MAGNUS: His regeneration cycle's almost complete. We'd better get him back. 
ANNIKA: Bye. 
(The drone is beamed away.)
ERIN: He's in his alcove. Nobody missed him. Enough drones for one day. Anybody hungry? 
ANNIKA: Me. 
MAGNUS: You two go ahead. I want to read through his cranial transceiver logs, see if he was ever in direct contact with the Queen. 
ERIN: Don't be long. 
[Janeway's quarters]
CHAKOTAY: It turns out his hunch was right. The drone had been receiving direct commands from this Borg Queen. I analysed the comm. signals. Look at the transpectral frequencies. 
JANEWAY: They match the ones that were sent to Seven. What did the Hansens learn about this Queen? 
CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid they never got a chance to find out. 
JANEWAY: One thing is certain. She contacted Seven of Nine, and the next day Seven rejoined the Borg. Obviously, she exerts some influence. 
CHAKOTAY: You think Seven was instructed to leave Voyager? 
JANEWAY: Instructed, coerced. She insisted she join the away team. She was adamant that if she didn't board that Sphere, our mission would fail. Sounds to me like she was being threatened. My instincts told me she was holding something back, but I, I didn't pursue it. I let her go. 
CHAKOTAY: If you hadn't, we might all be drones by now. 
JANEWAY: What's running through that Collective mind of yours? You've got thousands of species to choose from, billions of individuals. Why Seven of Nine? You should've assimilated us while you had the chance. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain? 
JANEWAY: I want you to keep analysing the Hansens' database. Compile a list of every technology they created to track the Borg. Assemble a team of engineers to assist you. 
CHAKOTAY: If you're planning a rescue mission, that research will only take us so far. 
JANEWAY: Oh? 
CHAKOTAY: I've studied their log entries long enough to realise that as brilliant as the Hansens were, they made a fatal mistake. They became overconfident. 
JANEWAY: We won't make the same mistake. 
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: This will be a long range tactical rescue. It could take days, even weeks, before we find our missing crewman. Lieutenant Torres is equipping the Delta Flyer with the transwarp coil. It'll allow us to cover more territory. An away team will take it into transwarp space, where Tuvok believes we can track the sphere that abducted Seven of Nine. Thanks to the Hansens, we'll be well prepared for an encounter with the Borg. Their multi-adaptive shielding will make the Flyer virtually invisible to Borg sensors, and narrow beam transporters will allow us to penetrate the Sphere. Mister Paris, you'll man the helm. Commander Tuvok, tactical. Doctor, there's no telling what condition Seven will be in when we find her. You'll come along. 
EMH: Yes, Captain. 
JANEWAY: I'll be leading the away team. The rest of you will remain on Voyager and maintain position at the threshold of our transwarp conduit. We may need tactical support when we return. You'll be taking your orders from Commander Chakotay. We'll be searching for one individual among thousands of drones. But she's one of us and I'm not about to let her go. Let's get started. 
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: All systems go. We're ready for the jump. 
JANEWAY: Bring the coil online. Prepare for transwarp. 
TUVOK: Power output fluctuating. 
JANEWAY: Compensating. 
PARIS: We're at critical velocity. 
JANEWAY: Engage, Mister Paris. 
PARIS: Transwarp in four, three, two. We've crossed the threshold. 
JANEWAY: Steady as she goes. Doctor, are you all right? 
EMH: Just a little motion sickness. I'll need to adjust my matrix to accommodate for extreme velocity. 
TUVOK: I'm detecting residual transwarp signatures. They match the Borg Sphere. 
JANEWAY: Adjust our course and follow it, Mister Paris. 
EMH: I believe the Captain's order was steady as she goes. 
JANEWAY: Full speed ahead. 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
QUEEN: We've arrived. Are you ready? 
SEVEN: I have familiarised myself with the species. 
QUEEN: Tactical weakness. 
SEVEN: Their vessels lack manoeuverability. 
QUEEN: Tactical strength. 
SEVEN: They've developed a modulating phaser pulse that can penetrate our shields. 
QUEEN: How do you propose we adapt? 
SEVEN: You are the Borg. You tell me. 
QUEEN: Thirty nine of their vessels are converging on our position. They're firing weapons. Our shields are failing. We will be destroyed. How do you propose we adapt? 
SEVEN: Triaxillate our shield geometry to absorb their phaser pulses. 
QUEEN: I was thinking the same thing. Adaptation complete. They're no longer a threat. Go to the Primary Assimilation Chamber. You'll monitor the bio-extraction process. You look reluctant. Maybe I've been pushing you too quickly. You can assist with the repairs to our shield matrix instead. Seven of Nine. Be efficient. 
[Assimilation chamber]
(Seven helps with the shield matrix, but she can hear the newcomers shouting. An alien is escorted past her, then something explodes. She goes to repair it and is knocked down by another explosion. Two Borg lift her up and scan her, then let her go. An alien breaks free of his escort and tries to run. She grabs him, and a Borg assimilates him in front of her eyes. She is shocked and moves away. Passing an assimilation chamber, she looks in and sees an alien with most of an arm amputated ready for augmentation. A female turns and looks at her. She is one of three waiting for similar procedures. Another control node explodes and the Borg standing guard goes to fix it. She deactivates the Borg surgeon and helps the alien sit up.)
SEVEN: Assist me. I am not Borg, I will help you escape. Assist me! 
(They help the male up. Seven uses a control panel.)
SEVEN: I'm detecting one of your vessels. It's heavily damaged, the crew is dead. The Borg are ignoring it. It's propulsion system is still functioning. I will transport you aboard. Remain there until the Borg leave orbit. Then set a course on a heading of one two one mark nine. Do you understand?
(They nod. She beams them away.) 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
QUEEN: Congratulations. 
SEVEN: Regarding? 
QUEEN: Assimilation is complete. 
SEVEN: Three hundred thousand individuals have been transformed into drones. Should they be congratulated as well? 
QUEEN: They should be. They've left behind their trivial, selfish lives and they've been reborn with a greater purpose. We've delivered them from chaos into order. 
SEVEN: Comforting words. Use them next time instead of resistance is futile. You may elicit a few volunteers. 
QUEEN: You cling to sarcasm because you are afraid to see the truth. Species one zero zero two six is already adding to our perfection. You can feel their distinctiveness coursing through us, enhancing us. Stop resisting. Take pleasure in this. 
SEVEN: I will not take pleasure in the destruction of a race. 
QUEEN: Human sentiment. Compassion, guilt, empathy. They're irrelevant. 
SEVEN: Not to me. 
QUEEN: Me? There is no me. There is only us. One mind. 
SEVEN: My thoughts are my own. 
QUEEN: We've overlooked something. A ship. Four lifeforms. They're trying to escape. How do you suggest we proceed? Destroy the vessel, or assimilate it? 
SEVEN: Neither. There are only four lifeforms and the vessel is heavily damaged. It would be an inefficient use of our resources. We should ignore it. 
QUEEN: In this case, our thoughts are not one. If those individuals are allowed to survive, species one zero zero two six will survive and continue to resist us. But that's what you were hoping for, wasn't it? You tried to mask their lifesigns, but I detected them. 
(A tractor beam from a Cube grabs the little ship.)
SEVEN: Release the vessel. 
QUEEN: I'm sorry this lesson has to be so painful for you, but you are a difficult pupil. Abandon your human frailties. They are the cause of your pain. 
SEVEN: Let them go. Please. 
(The little ship is released.) 
SEVEN: I thought compassion was irrelevant. 
MAGNUS [OC]: Field notes, U.S.S. Raven, stardate 32634.9. The Raven was hit by a subspace particle storm. We took heavy damage and our multi-adaptive shielding went offline for thirteen point two seconds. Unfortunately, it was long enough for the Borg to perceive us as a threat. 
[USS Raven - Bridge]
ERIN: I've found something. A nebula. 
MAGNUS: Class? 
ERIN: Mutara. Distance, three light years. I'm setting a course. 
MAGNUS: The particle density's too high. Our hull would breach. 
ERIN: We can reinforce structural integrity. 
MAGNUS: We'll find somewhere else to hide. 
ERIN: There's no time. 
[Annika's room]
MAGNUS [OC]: It's been three hours and the Cube hasn't found us yet. As long as we can keep masking our warp trail 
ERIN [OC]: The entire Collective knows about us by now. They'll send more ships. 
MAGNUS [OC]: The nebula's too dangerous. 
[USS Raven - Bridge]
MAGNUS: We've had close calls before. This is no different. Remember when the transporters failed? 
ERIN: And you had to spend the night in a maturation chamber, with fifty two neonatal drones. A transwarp conduit, two point three light years starboard. It's a Cube heading right for us. 
MAGNUS: Time to intercept? 
ERIN: One hour, maybe less. 
ANNIKA [OC]: Papa? 
MAGNUS: Be right there, Annika. Start looking for an M-class planet. We'll abandon ship if we have to. 
[Annika's room]
MAGNUS: Hey. 
ANNIKA: Are we going to be assimulated? 
MAGNUS: Not if I can help it. Go back to sleep, your mother and I have work to do. 
ANNIKA: Are the Borg mad at us? 
MAGNUS: No. 
ANNIKA: Then why are they chasing our ship? 
MAGNUS: They're curious about us, like we are about them. But don't worry, we won't let them get too close. 
ANNIKA: Can't we go home? 
MAGNUS: Soon. 
ANNIKA: Papa, will it hurt to be a drone? 
MAGNUS: Sleep. 
[Delta Flyer]
EMH: Captain? 
JANEWAY: Hmm. 
EMH: I'd like to suggest a few modifications to the comm. array. 
JANEWAY: Yes? 
EMH: I've studied Seven's cranial schematics and I've isolated the frequency of her interplexing beacon. When we catch up with the Sphere, we might be able to send her a brief message. 
JANEWAY: What if she's already been linked to the hive mind? 
EMH: Every drone has its own translink signature. Only Seven will be able to hear our message. 
JANEWAY: I'll give you a hand. 
EMH: The Hansen Diaries. Not exactly light reading. 
JANEWAY: I've been poring over their last log entries for any details we might have missed. I want to make sure history doesn't repeat itself. 
EMH: They should have quit while they were ahead. Ten million terraquads of data, three years in the wild. 
JANEWAY: They could have studied the Borg for another three decades and still have barely scratched the surface. I agree their methods were unorthodox, but that's been true of most great explorers. 
EMH: Most explorers don't take their four year old daughter along for the ride. 
JANEWAY: We'll get her back, Doctor, with her parents' help. 
PARIS: Captain, I've got a fix on the Sphere's location. It's in a region about two hundred light years from here. 
JANEWAY: Red alert. Bring the multi-adaptive shielding online. Set a course for those coordinates and prepare to disengage transwarp drive. 
(Later, in normal space, they approach the Unicomplex.)
JANEWAY: Report. 
TUVOK: I'm detecting thousands of integrated substructures, trillions of lifeforms, all Borg. 
PARIS: There's a Cube coming up fast off our port bow. ;
(And straight past.)
JANEWAY: Did they detect us? 
TUVOK: I don't believe so. 
JANEWAY: Any sign of our Sphere? 
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. Its ion signature leads directly to that whatever it is. 
JANEWAY: Take us in, Mister Paris, minimum thrusters. Begin scanning for Seven, Tuvok.
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
QUEEN: I have a task for you. We're planning to deploy a new mode of assimilation designed for highly resistant species. I want you to programme the nanoprobes. 
SEVEN: Your technology has changed since I left the Collective. My knowledge is insufficient. 
QUEEN: Your knowledge for the target species is invaluable. Species five six one eight. Human. Warp capable. Origin, grid three two five. Physiology inefficient, below average cranial capacity, minimal redundant systems, limited regenerative abilities. Our previous attempts to assimilate them were all direct assaults. They failed, so we've created a more surreptitious strategy. 
SEVEN: You intend to detonate a biogenic charge in Earth's atmosphere. 
QUEEN: It would infect all lifeforms with nanoprobe viruses. Assimilation would be gradual. By the time they realised what was happening, half their population would be drones. 
SEVEN: Inefficient. The virus would take years to proliferate. 
QUEEN: We've waited this long. Interface with the central alcove. Begin programming the nanoprobes. Be sure to enhance the viral sequencers. You've been involved in hundreds of assimilations. This is no different. 
SEVEN: To you, perhaps. Part of me is still human. I will not assist in their destruction. 
QUEEN: We all originated from lesser species. I myself came from species one two five. But that's irrelevant now. We are Borg. 
SEVEN: I am an individual. 
QUEEN: You're only repeating their words. You sound like a mindless automaton. Comply, or we will turn you into a drone. 
SEVEN: Proceed, if you wish. 
QUEEN: You're torn between your desire to be one with us and your loyalty to them. It's time for you to complete your task. All of your emotions, grief, guilt, remorse, compassion, will be irrelevant once humanity is assimilated. Forget Voyager. They were never your Collective. 
(Drones surround them closely.)
SEVEN: I am Annika Hansen. Human. 
QUEEN: I remember Annika. Does she remember us? She wasn't afraid. Why are you? 
SEVEN: You attacked us. You murdered my family. 
QUEEN: We did no such thing. We gave them perfection. 
(A drone steps forward. It is Magnus, her father.)
SEVEN: Papa. 
QUEEN: Your family's here. You're here. Be one with us again. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Seven of Nine, we're searching for you. Try to hang on. 
SEVEN: Captain. 
QUEEN: What did you say? 
SEVEN: Nothing. 
QUEEN: Janeway. 
[Delta Flyer]
; 
JANEWAY: Our transmission's being deflected. 
EMH: By whom? 
JANEWAY: I'm not certain. 
TUVOK: I have isolated Seven's position. She's inside a large infrastructure approximately six hundred kilometres away. 
JANEWAY: Set a course, Mister Paris. 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
QUEEN: She's close. Her comm. signal originated within this spatial grid, but we can't detect her vessel. He knows why. Your father designed the technology Captain Janeway's using. Multi-adaptive shielding. Your perfect defence against the Borg. But we assimilated that knowledge, didn't we? We will adapt easily. 
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: The Cube has altered course. It's heading straight for us. 
JANEWAY: They've detected us. Remodulate the shields. Evasive manoeuvres. 
PARIS: It flew right past us. 
JANEWAY: We won't fool their sensors much longer. Tuvok? 
TUVOK: Seven is inside a large chamber. 
JANEWAY: Can you get a lock on her? 
TUVOK: Not at this distance. 
JANEWAY: Take us to within transporter range. 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
QUEEN: We have their ship. A Federation shuttlecraft. Three lifeforms, one hologram. 
SEVEN: If you've captured their vessel, you've assimilated them by now. I would sense their presence in the Collective. Captain Janeway is eluding you. 
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: The chamber is too heavily shielded. I can't get a lock on her. 
JANEWAY: Can we beam into one of these adjoining corridors? 
TUVOK: I believe so. 
JANEWAY: Time for the bio-dampeners. Tom, hold our position. Target that chamber with full weapons. Stand by to fire on my command. 
PARIS: Ma'am, won't you be down there? 
JANEWAY: Do it. 
[Borg Sphere]
(Armed for bear, Janeway uses a tricorder to find Seven.)
JANEWAY: This way. 
(They are stopped by a forcefield.)
TUVOK: Try to locate the shield matrix. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok. 
TUVOK: I can disable the forcefield, but it will take several minutes. 
JANEWAY: Do it. 
(A Borg walks through the forcefield and straight past them.)
JANEWAY: Tuvok, give me the subdermal probe. 
[Borg Queen's Chamber]
QUEEN: It's not too late to save them. As you wish. 
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: They've isolated our shields again. Three vessels are converging. I'm remodulating. 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
(The Delta Flyer vanishes from the screen again.)
SEVEN: You underestimate them. 
QUEEN: It's time for a more aggressive approach. 
[Delta Flyer]
(Whumph!)
EMH: I thought they couldn't see us. 
PARIS: They can't! They're firing blind! 
[Borg Sphere]
(Janeway injects a drone in an alcove.)
JANEWAY: Wake him. It's transmitting. 
(The drone walks through the forcefield.)
JANEWAY: I've got it. Field modulation is three two four point nine five. 
(Tuvok adjusts her bio-dampener.)
TUVOK: Proceed. 
(Janeway goes through the forcefield, and her bio-dampener fritzes.)
JANEWAY: It's offline. 
TUVOK: You'll be detected. 
JANEWAY: Then I'd better hurry. You've got to disable the shield matrix around that chamber. 
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: It's no use, they've locked on to our shield modulators. They're adapting the second we change frequencies. 
BORG [OC]: We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. 
[Borg Queen's chamber]
BORG [OC]: Resistance is futile. 
QUEEN: You have failed them. 
SEVEN: No! 
QUEEN: We believed you would be an asset to us. We were wrong. You are weak. 
JANEWAY: Don't listen to her, Seven. She's irrelevant. Call them off or I'll destroy you. 
QUEEN: Your weapons are useless. 
JANEWAY: Don't be so sure. My tactical officer is disabling the shields around this room. Tom, status. 
PARIS [OC]: We've targeted the chamber, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Let her go, or I'll give the order to fire. 
QUEEN: You would be destroyed as well, along with your crewman. 
JANEWAY: Better than being one of you. Tom, high-yield torpedoes, full spread. Fire on my command. 
(The drones stop advancing on Janeway.) 
[Delta Flyer]
;PARIS: Captain, they've disengaged 
[Borg Queen's Chamber]
PARIS [OC] the tractor. 
JANEWAY: Hold your fire. Beam us out of here. 
PARIS [OC]: A dispersal field just activated around the chamber you're in. I can't get a lock. 
JANEWAY: Seven, shut down that field. 
QUEEN: Don't listen to her. She's poisoned your thoughts long enough. 
JANEWAY: I'm giving you an order. 
QUEEN: One order, one voice. Insignificant. ;
(Seven sends tubules into a control node. The field drops.)
JANEWAY: Tom, energise. 
SEVEN: She's adapting. 
PARIS [OC]: The field went up again, Captain. I can't beam you out. 
QUEEN: You will assist the Collective as drones. Assimilate them. 
SEVEN: Captain, target the power node directly above this alcove. It will disrupt her command interface. Our thoughts are one.
(Janeway shoots at the node, and she and Seven are beamed away.) 
[Delta Flyer]
(The EMH quickly scans Seven.)
EMH: Welcome back. 
(Whumph!)
PARIS: Three vessels, closing fast. 
TUVOK: Direct hit to our tactical array. Weapons are down. 
JANEWAY: Bring the coil online. Prepare for transwarp. 
(The Queen's shuttle is also in pursuit.)
JANEWAY: Tom? 
PARIS: Transwarp in four, three, two. A vessel entered the conduit with us, just before it closed. 
TUVOK: They're targeting our engines. 
JANEWAY: Maintain course. 
PARIS: Direct hit on the port nacelle. We're venting plasma. 
TUVOK: Rerouting emergency power. 
PARIS: It's not enough. I'll need thirty teradynes at least, or we'll lose transwarp. 
JANEWAY: How long to the rendezvous coordinates? 
PARIS: Two point four minutes, but we'll drop out of transwarp in less than one. 
JANEWAY: Reroute power from life support. 
;
EMH: Captain! 
JANEWAY: I'd rather suffocate than vaporise. Do it! 
[Bridge]
(Torres is at Seven's station.)
TORRES: I'm picking up transwarp signatures. There's a conduit approaching, thirty thousand kilometres off our port bow. 
CHAKOTAY: Battle stations. 
[Delta Flyer]
PARIS: We're twenty seconds from normal space. 
JANEWAY: The Borg vessel? 
TUVOK: Still in pursuit, closing rapidly. 
PARIS: Fifteen seconds. 
SEVEN: They're trying to lock on with a tractor beam. 
JANEWAY: Remodulate shields. 
PARIS: Threshold in eight, seven, six. 
TUVOK: They're locking on. 
PARIS: Five. 
SEVEN: I've re-polarised the shields. It's being deflected. 
PARIS: Three, two. 
[Bridge]
TORRES: They're through. 
CHAKOTAY: Voyager to Delta Flyer. Report. 
JANEWAY: We've got Seven, but there's a Borg vessel right behind us. 
CHAKOTAY: Target the threshold perimeter. Photon torpedoes, full spread. 
TORRES: Commander? 
CHAKOTAY: It should destabilise the matter stream and implode the conduit for at least a light year. 
TORRES: Torpedoes locked. 
CHAKOTAY: Fire

JANEWAY: Voyager, report. 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We collapsed 
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: the conduit. No sign of Borg activity. 
[Delta Flyer]
JANEWAY: Clear us for docking. We're coming home. 
[Bridge]
TORRES: Commander, I'm picking up Borg signatures. Lots of them. 
CHAKOTAY: Source? 
TORRES: The conduit. 
CHAKOTAY: I thought you collapsed it. 
TORRES: So did I. 
CHAKOTAY: Stand by weapons. Captain 
[Delta Flyer]
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Raise shields. We've got company. 
[Bridge]
TORRES: Here they come.

Captain's log, stardate 52619.2. We got another twenty thousand light years out of the transwarp coil before it gave out. I figure we're a good fifteen years closer to home. 
[Cargo Bay two]
JANEWAY: I see you've picked up some bad habits. 
SEVEN: Captain? 
JANEWAY: The Doctor told you to regenerate for at least two days. You're violating a direct medical command. 
SEVEN: I will comply when my work is completed. 
JANEWAY: Borg tactical data? 
SEVEN: During my time at Unimatrix One I acquired a vast amount of knowledge. It may prove useful in our future encounters with the Borg. I am downloading it into Voyager's database. The Borg believed I was unique, that I understood humanity. They were obviously mistaken. 
JANEWAY: How so? 
SEVEN: I betrayed the crew of Voyager, threatened you with assimilation. I did not expect you to return for me. 
JANEWAY: Looks like you still have a few things to learn. Time to regenerate. 
SEVEN: When I am finished. 
JANEWAY: No, now. That's an order. 
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Sweet dreams.
