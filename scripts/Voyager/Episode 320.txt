The Voyager Transcripts - Worst Case Scenario
Worst Case Scenario
Stardate: 50971.5
Original Airdate: May 7, 1997
[Corridor]
(Torres is in a yellow-shouldered uniform, and looking rather pleased with herself.) 
CHAKOTAY: Where are you headed? 
TORRES: The bridge. 
CHAKOTAY: Mind if I walk with you? 
TORRES: Not at all. 
CHAKOTAY: So, how's it going? 
TORRES: Not bad, I guess. 
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok still giving you a hard time? 
TORRES: No more than usual. 
CHAKOTAY: I don't know about you, but when I think about spending seventy years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache. I get the impression a lot of the crew agrees with me. Maquis and Starfleet. 
[Turbolift]
CHAKOTAY: Bridge. So, what do you think? 
TORRES: About what? 
CHAKOTAY: About what I've been saying. That a lot of the crew aren't too happy with our Chief of Security. And for that matter, I don't think Captain Janeway's winning any popularity contests either. Don't you agree? 
TORRES: Why do I get the feeling that you're testing me? 
CHAKOTAY: Let's just say I'm interested in your opinion. 
TORRES: Why? 
CHAKOTAY: You're a good officer. I like you. And I wouldn't want to see you get hurt. 
TORRES: Computer, halt turbolift. Look, what's this all about? 
CHAKOTAY: There're going to be some changes around here. All of the Maquis are in line, and about twenty five of the Starfleet crew are with us. 
TORRES: Are you saying there's going to be a mutiny? 
CHAKOTAY: And when the shooting starts, I'm going to need to know which side you're on. 
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Well, Commander, Voyager's all yours. 
CHAKOTAY: There's a first time for everything, I guess. Don't worry, Captain, I'll keep your ship safe and sound. 
JANEWAY: I'm sure you will. 
PARIS [OC]: Shuttlebay to Captain Janeway. 
JANEWAY: Go ahead, Mister Paris. 
PARIS [OC]: The shuttle's ready to go whenever you are. 
JANEWAY: On my way. 
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I've been thinking. Are you sure you don't want to take Lieutenant Tuvok with you, just in case the Rukani turn out to be less friendly than they seem? 
TUVOK: I assure you, Commander. I have made thorough preparations for the Captain's safety during her away mission. You, on the other hand, are still adapting to your duties as First Officer. Under the circumstances, I believe my time will be better spent assisting you in your effort to justify the trust the Captain has placed in you. 
JANEWAY: I appreciate your concern for my safety, Mister Chakotay, but Tuvok's right. Lieutenant Paris and I will be just fine. I'll see you in twenty four hours. 
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant, I want you to keep close tabs on the Captain's shuttle. Let's make sure she doesn't run into any trouble. 
TUVOK: Aye, sir. 
CHAKOTAY: Ensign, let's shut down those transporters and start that diagnostic we've been putting off. 
KIM: Sir, are you sure we shouldn't wait for the Captain to get back? 
TUVOK: Ensign Kim, you have been given a direct order. Do as the Commander tells you. 
KIM: Aye, sir. 
CHAKOTAY: Have you finished upgrading the internal sensors, Ensign? 
(Torres is at Mission Ops 2.) 
TORRES: I'm working on it, sir. 
CHAKOTAY: I hope so. 
(Two security men enter by the door next to Tuvok's station. Chakotay takes a PADD from one of them.) 
CHAKOTAY: Wait here. 
TUVOK: Is something wrong, sir? 
CHAKOTAY: No, it's just tomorrow's duty roster. 
TUVOK: Sir, Captain Janeway's shuttle has gone to warp. 
CHAKOTAY: Thank you, Tuvok. Chakotay to all hands. Let's do it. 
TUVOK: Sir? 
(Chakotay shoots Tuvok. One security guard shoots the helmsman, the other just misses Kim.) 
KIM: Red alert! Security to the Bridge! 
CHAKOTAY: You're wasting your time, Harry. All my teams have taken control of Security, Engineering and all key systems. 
KIM: You'll never get away with this. People will fight back. 
CHAKOTAY: That's going to be a little difficult. All your off-duty Starfleet friends have been locked down in quarters. 
(Kim is about to shoot Chakotay, but Ensign Torres gets him first.) 
CHAKOTAY: I guess you've made your choice. 
JONAS [OC]: Jonas to Chakotay. 
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. 
JONAS [OC]: They're putting up a fight on deck two. We could use some help. 
CHAKOTAY: Carlson, O'Donnell, get these people to the brig. Ayala, take the conn and move us out of com range of Janeway's shuttle. You're with me. 
[Turbolift]
CHAKOTAY: Deck two. Thanks for watching my back in there. 
TORRES: Right. 
CHAKOTAY: Are you okay? 
TORRES: To tell you the truth, shooting Harry got me a little rattled. 
CHAKOTAY: He's only stunned. We're not going to kill anybody today, unless it's absolutely necessary. Just stay close. 
[Corridor]
CHAKOTAY: Stay low. 
TORRES: They've got us pinned down. 
CHAKOTAY: We'll just have to shoot our way past them. Ready? 
(They shoot down the guards, one is taken out by a Bajoran woman with a phaser rifle.) 
TORRES: Seska! 
SESKA: It's just like old times, isn't it? 
CHAKOTAY: Thanks for the help. 
SESKA: We've got to get moving. Some of Janeway's people are trying to set up a command centre in the mess hall. 
[Mess hall]
(The Maquis blast their way in.) 
SESKA: I wouldn't do that if I were you. This phaser's set on wide beam. I could take you all in one shot. 
CHAKOTAY: Everybody, drop your weapons. 
NEELIX: You heard the man. Drop your weapons. Don't look so surprised, Commander. I know a winner when I see one. I'm with you. 
SESKA: Do you want me to shoot him? 
CHAKOTAY: We're still going to need a cook. Chakotay to Engineering. What's your status? 
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering is secure. 
CHAKOTAY: Transporter rooms one and two, status. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter room one is under control. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Transporter room two is secure. 
CHAKOTAY: Shuttlebay, status. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Shuttlebay is secured, Commander. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll take care of the prisoners here. You two get some help and start rounding up the personnel that are still locked down in quarters. Bring them to Cargo Bay one. 
SESKA: We did it. 
CHAKOTAY: Just like old times. 
[Corridor]
SESKA: You did a good job today. 
TORRES: Thanks. 
SESKA: Just make sure you keep it up. 
TORRES: What's that supposed to mean? 
SESKA: It means I'm not as easy to win over as Chakotay. Come on! Let's go. 
(They take a man from his quarters at gunpoint.) 
SESKA: Wait here. 
[Kes's quarters]
(Kes is back to short hair and a short skirt from her recent long hair and catsuits.) 
KES: Seska, what's going on? 
SESKA: Move it. 
KES: Why are we being treated like prisoners? 
SESKA: No talking. 
[Cargo bay]
SESKA: Over there, with the rest of them. 
KES: What are you going to do with us? 
SESKA: I said, no talking! 
TORRES: Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. 
SESKA: It told you it was a mistake letting Starfleet people in on this. 
CHAKOTAY: Now is not the time, Seska. Take a good look around you. You're under armed guard. You may also notice that your senior officers aren't here. They're in the brig. They'll be put off the ship at the first habitable planet we come to. All except Janeway and Paris, who will arrive at their rendezvous coordinates to find that Voyager's not there. In short, I've taken control of the ship. I don't blame any of you for the mistakes of your leaders, so I'm giving you a choice. You can be put off the ship with your superiors or you can do what Neelix and some of your other crew members have already done and join me. If you do, you'll be part of a crew that's going to do whatever it takes to get us home as fast as possible. Under my command, we won't let almighty Federation principles get in the way of opportunities the way Janeway did when she destroyed the array that could have gotten us home. And we won't be wasting precious time stopping to investigate every insignificant anomaly that we come across. What we will do is use any means necessary to acquire technology that can shorten our journey. To hell with Starfleet regulations. You have fifteen minutes to make up your minds. 
PARIS: B'Elanna, what's going on here? 
TORRES: Computer, freeze programme. Are you in the habit of just walking in on people's private holodeck time? 
PARIS: Well, it's not as if I caught you dancing the rumba with a naked Bolian. We had a lunch date, remember? 
TORRES: Is it lunch time already? I must have lost track of the time. 
PARIS: Well, I expected to find you shooting pool at Sandrine's, not hanging out with Seska. What sort of programme is this anyway? 
TORRES: It's really something. I was doing a routine purge of the database, you know, taking out old files that were taking up space, and I found this holonovel. It's a kind of 'what if' story, all about a Maquis mutiny. It's completely compelling and believable. I guess it's because it's all about us. 
PARIS: Who wrote it? 
TORRES: Now, that is the big mystery. Whoever the author is has gone to a lot of trouble to keep his identity a secret. It's been encrypted. 
PARIS: Why do you suppose someone would try so hard to be anonymous? 
TORRES: Well, think about it. Whoever plays this programme takes on the role of a Starfleet security officer who gets approached by Chakotay to help the Maquis take over the ship. I mean, it's pretty inflammatory. 
PARIS: You think we should tell the Captain? 
TORRES: Probably. 
PARIS: It would be pretty hard for us to give her a full report if we don't know how the story ends. 
TORRES: Excellent point. 
PARIS: Great. Can you reset it for me? 
TORRES: You? I was just getting to the good part. 
PARIS: Oh, come on, B'Elanna. Be a sport. I've got to be back on duty in less than an hour. Besides, isn't half the fun of a holonovel having someone to talk it over with? 
TORRES: All right. You owe me one. 
[Holographic Corridor]
(Paris is now the security Ensign.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Where are you headed? 
PARIS: The bridge. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Mind if I walk with you? 
PARIS: I was kind of hoping you would. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: So, how's it going? 
PARIS: Couldn't be better. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Tuvok still giving you a hard time? 
PARIS: Oh, doesn't he always? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I don't know about you, but when I think about spending seventy years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache. 
PARIS: Not to mention an upset stomach. 
[Holographic Turbolift]
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Bridge. 
PARIS: I hear you're planning a mutiny. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Computer, halt turbolift. Who told you that? 
PARIS: Let's just say there are rumours. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Yeah, well, don't believe everything you hear. 
PARIS: Of course not. I just wanted you to know that whatever happens, I'm with you. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Computer, resume turbolift. 
PARIS: I'm serious. Just tell me what you want me to do. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: All right, Ensign, here it is. As soon as the Captain leaves to meet the Rukani, I want you to put all crew quarters on lock-down. I'll ask you if you've finished upgrading the internal sensors. If you say yes, I'll know we're ready to go. 
PARIS: I understand. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I'm watching you. No tricks. 
[Holographic Bridge]
HOLO-TUVOK: We are entering the Rukani sector, Commander. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Inform the Captain. 
HOLO-TUVOK: Aye, sir. 
HOLO-JANEWAY: Well, Commander, Voyager's all yours. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: There's a first time for everything, I guess. Don't worry, Captain. I'll keep your ship safe and sound. 
HOLO-JANEWAY: I'm sure you will. 
HOLO-PARIS [OC]: Shuttlebay to Captain Janeway. 
HOLO-JANEWAY: Go ahead, Mister Paris. 
HOLO-PARIS [OC]: The shuttle's ready to go whenever you are. 
HOLO-JANEWAY: On my way. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Captain, I've been thinking. Are you sure you don't want to take Lieutenant Tuvok with you, just in case the Rukani turn out to be less friendly than they seem? 
HOLO-TUVOK: I assure you, Commander. I have made thorough preparations for the Captain's safety during her away mission. You, on the other hand, are still adapting to your duties as First Officer. Under the circumstances, I believe my time will be better spent assisting you in your effort to justify the trust the Captain has placed in you. 
HOLO-JANEWAY: I appreciate your concern for my safety, Mister Chakotay, but Tuvok's right. Lieutenant Paris and I will be just fine. I'll see you in twenty four hours. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant, I want you to keep close tabs on the Captain's shuttle. Let's make sure she doesn't run into any trouble. 
HOLO-TUVOK: Aye, sir. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Ensign, let's shut down the transporters and start that diagnostic we've been putting off. 
HOLO-KIM: Sir, are you sure we shouldn't wait for the Captain to get back? 
HOLO-TUVOK: Ensign Kim, you have been given a direct order. Do as the Commander tells you. 
HOLO-KIM: Aye, sir. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Have you finished upgrading the internal sensors? 
PARIS: Yes, sir. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I hope so. 
(Carlson and O'Donnell enter.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Wait here. 
HOLO-TUVOK: Is something wrong, sir? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: No, it's just tomorrow's duty roster. 
HOLO-TUVOK: The Captain's shuttle has gone to warp. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Thank you, Tuvok. Chakotay to all hands. Let's do it. 
HOLO-TUVOK: Sir? 
PARIS: Tuvok, get down! 
(Too late. Chakotay shoots Tuvok. Paris jumps one of the guards, Kim shoots the other. Chakotay shoots Kim. Ayala pulls Paris off the guard.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I guess you've made your choice. 
PARIS: It's not over yet, Chakotay. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Take them all to the brig. 
[Holographic Brig]
PARIS: Sir, we have to do something. 
HOLO-TUVOK: What did you have in mind, Ensign? 
PARIS: Escape. Retake the ship. 
HOLO-TUVOK: We will indeed attempt to do so when the time is right. 
PARIS: What about trying it now? 
HOLO-TUVOK: Such a foolhardy proposal suggests a lack of proper training. Need I remind you that we are confined behind an electrostatic forcefield? 
PARIS: We can't just sit here and do nothing. 
HOLO-TUVOK: We are hardly doing nothing. We are observing the enemy, watching for any discernible patterns in their procedures, looking for any weakness in their defences. 
PARIS: How long is this observing business going to take? It's been over an hour already. I'm getting bored. 
HOLO-TUVOK: I am not concerned with your amusement, Ensign. We are in a crisis situation, and we will follow procedure. And procedure dictates that we wait for the right opportunity to attempt an escape, whether it takes an hour or a week. 
PARIS: A week? Who wrote this stuff? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Hold Kim and Tuvok here. Bring the rest of them to Cargo bay one. 
PARIS: Enjoy the wait. 
[Holographic Cargo Bay]
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: And we won't be wasting precious time stopping to investigate every insignificant anomaly we come across. What we will do is use any means necessary to acquire technology that can shorten our journey. To hell with Starfleet regulations. You have fifteen minutes to make up your minds. 
PARIS: I don't need fifteen minutes. I'm with you right now. 
[Mess hall]
PARIS: So by the time I got around to joining Chakotay's little band of rebels 
TORRES: Ah ha. 
PARIS: He was so suspicious of my motives that he assigned me to lubricate the warp plasma manifolds. 
TORRES: You should have tried going along with the mutiny from the beginning. It's much more fun. 
PARIS: Oh, believe me, next time I will. 
NEELIX: I couldn't help overhearing. You two are talking about the new holonovel. I tried sending an encoded message to Captain Janeway's shuttle to warn her about the mutiny. But Chakotay caught me, phasered me, and the programme reset. Next time, I'm going to pretend to go along with the conspirators and then stage a counterstrike. 
PARIS: I thought we were going to keep this our little secret. 
TORRES: Don't look at me. I didn't tell him. 
NEELIX: I heard about it from the Doctor. 
PARIS: The Doctor? 
TORRES: I may have let it slip while I was running his weekly diagnostic. 
PARIS: Oh, great. Who else knows about it? 
NEELIX: Don't worry about me. My lips are sealed. 
KIM: So what's this Ayala tells me about a new holonovel? 
PARIS: Get in line, Harry. 
Lieutenant Paris's personal log: Stardate 50953.4. I've decided to take B'Elanna's advice and replay the holonovel, this time as a full-fledged member of Chakotay's team of mutineers. I hope it turns out better than before. 
[Holographic Bridge]
(The Maquis are back in their original leather clothes.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Where the hell are those warp engines? 
HOLO-SESKA: They're still offline. We can't seem to get the dilithium matrix reinitialised. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: It's been two days. 
HOLO-SESKA: Don't worry. B'Elanna's on it. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Run a full security sweep. Something tells me there's more to this engine problem than a faulty dilithium matrix. 
PARIS: Do you think we've got a saboteur on board? 
HOLO-SESKA: There's a ship approaching, bearing two one six mark three three. It's Janeway's shuttle. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Open a channel. Hello, Kathryn. How did it go with the Rukani? 
HOLO-JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: You're out of uniform, Commander. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: There have been a few changes since you've been gone. 
HOLO-JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: So I've heard. You think I don't have any friends left on Voyager? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Apparently you do. But I'll find them. 
HOLO-JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: And then what? Will you kill them or just put them off the ship? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Nobody has to die here today. 
HOLO-JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: I thought you were a man of your word, Chakotay. I guess I was mistaken. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I'm sorry it had to come to this. But the crew believes I can get them home faster than you can. 
HOLO-PARIS [on viewscreen]: That's going to be a little difficult without warp engines, isn't it? 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Our warp drive may be temporarily offline, but our weapons systems are fully operational. 
PARIS: They're powering phasers. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Kathryn, don't try to be a hero. I've been reasonable so far. I'll allow you to keep the shuttle. I'll even transport you some extra provisions. But if you don't stand down, I will destroy your shuttle. 
HOLO-JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: You've just threatened the wrong woman, Chakotay. 
(Transmission ends. The shuttle fires on Voyager.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: What does she think she's going to accomplish? 
HOLO-SESKA: We can obliterate them in one shot. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Not till I give the order. Reopen a channel. 
PARIS: I don't know how, but they've disabled our shields. We're completely vulnerable. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Target their warp core and fire. 
HOLO-SESKA: I always said Janeway was a fool. 
COMPUTER: Intruder alert on deck eight. 
PARIS: It's Paris and Janeway. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Janeway's no fool. She tricked us into destroying her shuttle, then transported over while the shields were down. 
HOLO-SESKA: She's trying to free the prisoners. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You've got the bridge. You're with me. 
[Holographic Brig]
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Get away from that panel! 
(Chakotay shoots Janeway. Holo-Paris is behind Paris.) 
HOLO-PARIS: Drop it. 
(The programme ends.) 
[Holodeck]
PARIS: Computer, resume programme. 
COMPUTER: The holographic simulation has ended. 
PARIS: Well, start it up again, right where it left off. 
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. 
PARIS: Why not? 
COMPUTER: Additional narrative parameters have not been programmed. 
PARIS: Are you saying there's no more story? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. 
PARIS: This is someone's idea of a practical joke, right? 
COMPUTER: Please rephrase the question. 
(Later, the Chief Engineer is trying to solve the problem.) 
TORRES: There. I've bypassed the security override. Try it now. 
PARIS: Computer, identify the author of holographic programme entitled Insurrection Alpha. 
COMPUTER: That information is classified. 
TORRES: I've tried every decryption protocol I can think of. Whoever wrote this is good. 
PARIS: Not to mention sadistic. I can't believe we've been left hanging like this. 
(Neelix enters.) 
NEELIX: Any luck? Me neither. I've discreetly questioned everybody I thought I could trust. Either nobody knows or nobody's talking. 
PARIS: Remember the good old days when it was impossible to keep a secret on a ship this small? 
[Briefing room]
JANEWAY: Well, if that takes care of our official agenda, there's another matter I'd like to discuss. Commander Chakotay informs me there's a new holonovel that's become quite popular among the crew. 
CHAKOTAY: It's been accessed forty seven times by thirty three different crew members. 
JANEWAY: I don't suppose anyone here is familiar with what we're talking about? 
TORRES: Er, actually, er, Captain, I'm the one who found it on the auxiliary database. 
PARIS: I've been running it too. 
CHAKOTAY: Anybody else? 
JANEWAY: I understand that the author of this little opus has chosen to remain anonymous. Perhaps because of the controversial nature of the story, which depicts Commander Chakotay as the leader of a Maquis mutiny. Well, now that the cat's out of the bag, I want each of you to talk to your staff and find out who our anonymous author is. 
TUVOK: That won't be necessary, Captain. I am the author of the programme in question. 
PARIS: You, Tuvok? 
JANEWAY: I never knew you had literary aspirations. 
NEELIX: Not to mention talent. What a story! 
TUVOK: I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding. The programme is not a holonovel. It is a tactical training scenario. When you first invited the Maquis to join our crew, I believed that mutiny was a very real possibility. With that in mind, I began to write a training programme for junior security officers to prepare them for such an eventuality. 
PARIS: But you never finished it? 
TUVOK: No. As the two crews began to work together, I concluded that the threat of an insurrection was increasingly unlikely. I realised the programme itself might exacerbate the very conflict I sought to avoid. Therefore, I deleted the scenario, or so I believed. 
JANEWAY: Apparently you didn't account for B'Elanna's exceptional computer skills. 
TUVOK: Nor her somewhat excessive curiosity. I apologise for my carelessness, Captain. 
PARIS: Forget your carelessness. What you should be apologising for is leaving us all hanging by a thread. You've got to finish the story. 
TUVOK: On the contrary, Mister Paris. The programme has the potential to incite animosity among the crew and must be permanently deleted. I have no doubt the captain concurs. 
JANEWAY: With all due respect, Mister Tuvok, loosen up. You may have intended this programme to be a tactical training tool, but it looks to me like it's turned into a bit of harmless fun. 
TUVOK: As the Captain of this ship, surely you 
JANEWAY: I'm more than just a Captain. I'm the leader of a community, and communities need entertainment, culture, creative outlets. Since we're not exactly privy to every new piece of music or holonovel that's written back home, I think it's only natural that we should start creating our own. 
CHAKOTAY: Besides, Tuvok, if the crew doesn't get an ending, you may have a real mutiny on your hands. 
PARIS: If Tuvok doesn't want to finish the story, I volunteer. 
TORRES: Oh? 
PARIS: Well, I've always wanted to write a holonovel. I think I could make it pretty exciting. 
JANEWAY: Good. Then it's settled. I for one can't wait to see if Captain Janeway manages to outwit the conspirators. 
[Mess hall]
PARIS: Well, if it isn't Mister Anonymous. Come to check up on your replacement? 
TUVOK: Since the captain insists on allowing you to proceed with this frivolous exercise, I thought you might benefit from the original probability studies I conducted before beginning the scenario. 
PARIS: Well, thanks, Tuvok, but I don't need any probability studies. I'm just sort of making it up as I go along. 
TUVOK: Indeed. I'd be curious to know what you've made up thus far. 
PARIS: Well, I was thinking, Paris and Janeway retake the ship, and then she decides to execute all the conspirators. 
TUVOK: That is an entirely implausible plot development. Captain Janeway would never behave in such an inhumane manner. 
PARIS: This isn't real life, Tuvok. It's fiction. Don't get so caught up in logic. 
TUVOK: Logic is an integral part of narrative structure. According to the Dictates of Poetics by T'hain of Vulcan, a character's actions must flow inexorably from his or her established traits. 
PARIS: Well, I don't know anything about T'hain, but I do know what makes an interesting story, and that's unexpected plot twists. 
TUVOK: If you think I will allow you to turn this programme into a parody, you are sorely mistaken. 
PARIS: Are you saying that you're going to finish it yourself? 
TORRES: Artistic differences? 
TUVOK: I would hardly call Mister Paris's ideas artistic. 
PARIS: Apparently, my instincts don't comply with the Vulcan Dictates of Poetics. 
TORRES: Well, I've got a couple of suggestions that might help. Now, up until now the story's been nothing but action, which is fine. But what it needs is a little heart, a little emotion. 
TUVOK: We are not writing a romance novel, Lieutenant. 
PARIS: We? 
TUVOK: I've decided that your efforts would benefit from my collaboration. 
PARIS: Oh, really? 
TORRES: Listen, I don't care which one of you is writing this thing. All I'm saying is that there is room in every good story for a little bit of passion. 
PARIS: You know, maybe you're on to something. I could add a steamy love scene between the Starfleet conn officer and the Maquis engineer. 
TORRES: Oh, that's realistic. 
NEELIX: How about a fresh pot of coffee to keep those creative juices flowing, eh? 
PARIS: Thanks, Neelix. 
NEELIX: While I'm here. 
PARIS: Let me guess. You have a suggestion to make. 
NEELIX: Of course not. I would never presume to interfere in the creative process. It's more of a comment, really, about the Neelix character. 
TUVOK: How surprising. 
JANEWAY: He would never betray the Captain the way he does in that story. No offence, Mister Vulcan, but I don't think you understand my character very well. 
PARIS: Tuvok, did you forget to follow the Dictates of Poetics? 
TUVOK: Perhaps we should find someplace quieter to work. 
PARIS: Now, that's the first intelligent suggestion I've heard all evening. 
[Corridor]
TUVOK: I believe our first step should be to create a carefully constructed outline of the remaining chapters. 
PARIS: I told you, Tuvok. I'm just making it up as I go. 
TUVOK: We cannot proceed without a carefully constructed outline. 
PARIS: There you go with that we stuff again. I don't remember agreeing to let you help me. 
TUVOK: Need I remind you that it was I who first began the scenario? 
PARIS: And you think I'm compromising your creative vision? 
TUVOK: In so many words, yes. And it is my duty to ensure that ship security is not compromised by your creative vision. 
PARIS: You had your chance to finish the story, and you wanted to delete it. 
TUVOK: True, but since that is no longer an option, I am now exercising my prerogative as the original author. 
PARIS: Look, Tuvok, for the last time, I don't need any help. 
[Holodeck]
EMH: Ah, there you are. I have several brilliant ideas for upcoming chapters of your holonovel, as well as a list of revisions and dialogue changes that I believe will improve the earlier installments. 
PARIS: I don't believe this. 
EMH: No thanks are necessary. In addition, I'm prepared to offer my expertise in the creation of holographic mise-en-scene. 
TUVOK: Computer, override the EMH program's autonomous controls and transfer him back to Sickbay. 
EMH: Now, wait just a min 
(The EMH disappears.) 
PARIS: Thanks, Tuvok. Now that I think about it, I'll take it from here. 
TUVOK: You may find that difficult, since I am the only one who can make additions to the programme. 
PARIS: All right, Tuvok. You win. We'll finish the story together. 
TUVOK: That is a very rational decision, Mister Paris. Computer, reinitiate the holographic programme entitled Insurrection Alpha, security clearance Tuvok four seven seven four. 
COMPUTER: The programme has been reinitiated. 
PARIS: The first thing we're going to change is that title. 
TUVOK: Reformat the holo-matrix for the addition of new interactive algorithms. 
COMPUTER: The holo-matrix has been formatted. 
TUVOK: Reopen the narrative parameters file. 
(The holodeck glitches.) 
[Bridge]
KIM: Captain, we just lost power in both transporter rooms. The com went down, and the holodeck systems are completely scrambled. 
[Holographic Brig]
PARIS: What are we doing in the brig? 
TUVOK: I have no idea. We haven't given the computer instructions to create a location yet. 
HOLO-SESKA: Hello, Tuvok. I've been expecting you. If you can see me, you've obviously reopened the narrative parameters file of the tactical scenario you've been working on. 
TUVOK: How do you know that? You're a hologram. 
HOLO-SESKA: That's right. A holographic representation of Seska, one of the Maquis shipmates you betrayed. I would have thought all that time you spent spying on us might have given you a little more insight into the Maquis, but after looking over what you've already written, I can see you need a little help. So I've created this representation of myself, to guide you through the rest of the programme. 
TUVOK: There is no more programme. 
HOLO-SESKA: There is now. I finished writing it for you, with a few revisions of my own. 
PARIS: Revisions? 
HOLO-SESKA: To start with, the holodeck is now sealed. Your friends will find it very difficult to get you out of here. And the safety protocols are off, which means if I shoot you, and I am going to shoot you, you'll die. But not just yet. You've got ten seconds to run. Nine, eight 
TUVOK: Computer, end programme. 
HOLO-SESKA: Seven, six, five 
TUVOK: Holodeck one to Bridge. Emergency transport. 
HOLO-SESKA: Oh, did I forget to tell you? The moment you restarted the programme, the com system went down. Four, three 
PARIS: I guess we'd better do what she says. 
HOLO-SESKA: Two, one. 
[Holographic Corridor]
PARIS: You should never have crossed her, Tuvok. 
TUVOK: She has been dead for over a year now. There would have been no way to predict this turn of events. 
PARIS: I guess we should have known Seska wouldn't let a little thing like death stop her from getting even. 
HOLO-JANEWAY: Tuvok. Tom. In here. 
PARIS: Captain? 
[Holographic Transporter Room]
HOLO-JANEWAY: We're going to have to transport to the cargo bay to free the rest of the prisoners. It's safer than trying to make it on foot. 
PARIS: She's a hologram too? 
TUVOK: Apparently she believes we're here to help her retake the ship from the mutineers. 
PARIS: I say we play along. We could use all the help we can get against Seska. 
TUVOK: You're forgetting it was Seska who rewrote the scenario. For all we know, she's programmed Captain Janeway to betray us. 
PARIS: I suppose you have a better idea? 
TUVOK: The safest course of action is to avoid participation of any kind. Eventually, the real Captain will discover our predicament and shut down the programme from the outside. 
HOLO-JANEWAY: Let's move! 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Hold it right there! 
HOLO-JANEWAY: Back off! 
HOLO-SESKA: Or what? You'll shoot us? Go right ahead. 
HOLO-JANEWAY: Whatever you say. 
(Janeway fires her phaser rifle, but it backfires and kills her.) 
HOLO-SESKA: Poor Kathryn. I guess nobody told her the phaser rifles from storage locker three have been malfunctioning. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You're an incredible woman, Seska. 
(Holo-Chakotay kisses Seska.) 
HOLO-SESKA: You see who's in charge now, don't you? So if I were you, I'd get moving again. The programme's not over. 
TUVOK: We have no intention of participating in this exercise. 
HOLO-SESKA: You don't want to end up like your Captain, do you? 
PARIS: You programmed all this. The malfunctioning phaser, the version of Chakotay who's attracted to you. None of it's real. 
HOLO-SESKA: You hear that? He thinks this is a game. Show him he's wrong. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I've been waiting a long time for this. 
(Holo-Chakotay shoots Paris in the arm.) 
HOLO-SESKA: Next time, you'll believe me when I tell you the safety protocols are off. Now, you've got five seconds to start running again, or you'll end up with more than a flesh wound. 
[Holographic Corridor]
PARIS: So much for not playing along with Seska's programme. 
TUVOK: Are you able to continue? 
PARIS: I'll keep up. The question is, where are we going? 
TUVOK: I have an idea. 
[Holographic Sickbay]
PARIS: What's the point? This isn't the real Sickbay. 
TUVOK: I may be able to use some of this holographic equipment to treat your wound. Besides, it's as good a place as any to hide from Seska. 
HOLO-EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. 
PARIS: No emergency, Doc. I'm fine. 
HOLO-EMH: Nonsense. You have second-degree phaser burns. Please have a seat on biobed one. 
PARIS: That's all right, Doc. I'm telling you, I feel fine. 
HOLO-EMH: You require treatment. Twenty cc's nitric acid. A little proverbial salt in the wound. 
(Paris screams in pain. Tuvok disarms the EMH, who then hits him and starts to strangle him.) 
HOLO-EMH: You're looking well. 
TUVOK: Go! 
PARIS: I'm not going to leave you! 
(Paris tries to hit the EMH, but his hand passes through his head.) 
HOLO-EMH: It was a pleasure treating you. Don't hesitate to call again. 
(The Holo-EMH throws them both out of his Sickbay.) 
[Holographic Corridor]
TUVOK: Are you all right, Mister Paris? 
PARIS: Oh, just great. Maybe we can go to the mess hall now and let the holographic Neelix burn my arm with a frying pan. 
TUVOK: Your feeble attempt at wit notwithstanding, it does appear that Seska has reprogrammed the holographic crew to torture us. I suggest we avoid meeting any more of them. 
HOLO-SESKA [OC]: Seska to Tuvok. I know you can hear me. 
PARIS: Oh, terrific. 
HOLO-SESKA [OC]: I just wanted to remind you that wherever you go, I'll find you. 
PARIS: I say we try the Jefferies tubes. 
TUVOK: I concur. 
[Bridge]
KIM: Captain, you're not going to believe this, but Seska caused these cascade failures. 
JANEWAY: Seska? How? 
TORRES: What she lacked in loyalty she made up for in ingenuity. According to the back-up computer logs, she got into Tuvok's scenario on stardate 48671 about a month before she left the ship. She programmed it to cause all of these shutdowns the next time Tuvok reopened the narrative parameters file, which he didn't do until today. 
JANEWAY: Can we get them out? 
TORRES: Seska laid booby-trapped subroutines everywhere. If we try to open the holodeck doors, the power grid is rigged to explode. 
KIM: And the transporters are still offline. 
JANEWAY: You said the narrative parameters file is open now? 
KIM: Seska's revised programme is playing out as we speak. 
JANEWAY: If Seska can rewrite Tuvok, maybe I can rewrite Seska. 
[Holographic Jefferies tube]
PARIS: So, Tuvok, anything in the Dictates of Poetics about how to escape from a ship full of insane holograms? 
TUVOK: Your attempts at humour are hardly constructive, Mister Paris. 
(He unlocks an internal hatch to reveal a plasma fire.) 
TUVOK: The controls are jammed. I cannot close the hatch. 
(A plasma fire extinguisher appears.) 
PARIS: Tuvok! 
(Paris puts out the fire.) 
PARIS: Where do you suppose this came from? 
TUVOK: That is an intriguing question. 
PARIS: Do you think Seska's toying with us? Taking us to the brink of death again, then letting us live so she can keep torturing us? 
TUVOK: I prefer a more optimistic interpretation. It is possible our shipmates outside the holodeck have learned of our predicament and have found a way to help us by making additions to the programme, such as that plasma extinguisher. 
PARIS: If you want to look on the bright side, I'm certainly not going to argue with you. 
(They go down a ladder.) 
PARIS: If they do know what's going on, why just hand us a plasma extinguisher? Why not shut down the holo-grid, or change the scenario? 
TUVOK: I would imagine Seska has made it very difficult for anyone to implement more than minor changes. 
PARIS: Take a look at this. 
(On Aux Systems Monitor 128 - TRYING TO HELP YOU. GO TO WEAPONS LOCKER.) 
PARIS: You were right. 
TUVOK: We must follow their instructions. 
(But when they try to exit the Jefferies tube system.) 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Hello, boys. 
[Engineering]
HOLO-CHAKOTAY [on monitor]: What do you say we go for a little walk? 
JANEWAY: Where did they come from? 
TORRES: Seska's programme is adding new algorithms to counteract the changes we're making. 
JANEWAY: I need more access to the narrative subroutines. 
TORRES: I can't get in. 
JANEWAY: You'd better find a way, otherwise Tom and Tuvok aren't going to make it out of there alive. It looks like Chakotay's taking them to the holographic cargo bay. 
TORRES: Torres to Kim. How are you coming 
[Bridge]
TORRES [OC]: With those transporters? 
KIM: Seska's programme has completely disabled the relay access ports. 
[Engineering]
KIM [OC]: It's going to take a while to get Tom and Tuvok out of there. 
JANEWAY: I guess that means I keep writing. 
[Holographic Cargo Bay]
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: As you can see, the last of your comrades have been captured. In case anybody had any doubts, it should be obvious by now that this is no longer a Starfleet vessel. 
HOLO-SESKA: Bring Paris and Tuvok over here. You and you, bring your weapons. 
[Engineering]
HOLO-CHAKOTAY on monitor]: What are you doing? 
HOLO-SESKA [on monitor]: What do you think I'm doing? I'm going to execute them right here. 
JANEWAY: I need access to the character algorithms now! 
TORRES: I'm on it. 
[Holographic Cargo Bay]
HOLO-SESKA: Fire on my order. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Belay that. 
HOLO-SESKA: What are you doing? We planned this. 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure it's necessary to kill them. 
TUVOK: If I'm not mistaken, the Chakotay hologram is undergoing some sort of character change. 
PARIS: Do you think they're trying to help us again? 
HOLO-SESKA: These two rodents betrayed us. They deserve to die. 
TUVOK: Don't listen to her, Commander. You've taken the ship. There is no need to add murder to your list of offences. 
HOLO-SESKA: Quiet! 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Lower your weapons. 
[Engineering]
TORRES: It's working. 
JANEWAY: Now, if I can just keep modifying the Chakotay hologram. 
HOLO-SESKA [on monitor]: You're not going to lose your nerve, are you? 
[Holographic Cargo Bay]
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: We have what we want. There's no reason to kill them. 
HOLO-SESKA: Prepare to fire on my order! 
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Seska! I'm in command of this operation. 
[Engineering]
HOLO-SESKA [on monitor]: Not anymore. 
(Holo-Seska kills Holo-Chakotay.) 
TORRES: I don't believe it. The programme is reconfiguring the subprocessors to counter every change we make. No matter what we do, it rewrites itself so that Tom and Tuvok will die. 
JANEWAY: I'm not out of ideas yet. 
[Holographic Cargo Bay]
HOLO-SESKA: Now, is there anyone else who wants to challenge my authority? Isn't their loyalty inspiring? Set your phasers to kill. 
PARIS: Don't listen to her. 
HOLO-SESKA: Fire on my order. 
(Whumph!) 
HOLO-SESKA: What the hell was that? 
(Whumph again! Everyone falls down. Tuvok and Paris grab phasers from Maquis.) 
TUVOK: Don't move, Seska. 
HOLO-CREWWOMAN [OC]: Bridge to Seska. We're under attack by the Rukani. 
HOLO-SESKA: The Rukani? 
PARIS: The people the captain and I were visiting while you were busy taking over the ship. When we realised there was a mutiny in progress, we called them for a little assistance. 
[Engineering]
JANEWAY: Harry, have you got transporters yet? 
KIM [OC]: Still working on it, Captain. 
[Holographic Cargo Bay]
HOLO-SESKA: You're not getting this ship back. 
TUVOK: That is a rather bold statement for someone in your position. 
HOLO-SESKA: Computer, initiate sixty seconds self-destruct sequence, authorisation zeta one. 
COMPUTER: This ship will self-destruct in sixty seconds. 
TUVOK: Computer, belay that order, authorisation Tuvok four seven seven four. 
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Voiceprint not recognised. 
HOLO-SESKA: If you don't hand over that phaser rifle, everyone on this ship is going to be dead in 
COMPUTER: Self-destruct in forty five seconds. 
[Engineering]
TORRES: I don't know how she rigged it, Captain, but when she ordered the self-destruct it initiated an overload in the holodeck power relays. The whole grid is going to blow. 
[Holographic Cargo Bay]
COMPUTER: Self-destruct in thirty seconds. 
HOLO-SESKA: Hand over the weapon, or the ship is going to be destroyed. 
TUVOK: I have set this phaser to kill. If you do not deactivate the self-destruct sequence, I will fire. 
HOLO-SESKA: I'm surprised at you, Tuvok. That's not very logical. If I'm dead, who'll turn off the self-destruct? 
COMPUTER: Fifteen seconds to self-destruct. Thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine 
(Tuvok and Paris hand over their weapons.) 
HOLO-SESKA: Computer, terminate self-destruct sequence, authorisation zeta one. 
COMPUTER: Self-destruct sequence has been terminated. 
HOLO-SESKA: Now call off your Rukani friends. 
TUVOK: Do what she says. 
PARIS: Tuvok 
TUVOK: That's an order, Mister Paris. 
PARIS: Paris to the Rukani vessel. Thank you for your assistance, but everything's under control now. 
HOLO-SESKA: It is, isn't it? I guess if you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself. 
(Seska fires the phaser rifle, and kills herself.) 
PARIS: Not bad. 
TUVOK: Seska's not the only one who knows how to cause a phaser malfunction. 
COMPUTER: The holographic simulation has ended. 
[Engineering]
TORRES: It's over. 
KIM [OC]: Kim to Engineering. I think I can give you transporters now, Captain. 
JANEWAY: That's all right, Harry. No rush. 
[Mess hall]
JANEWAY: Here's to stories with happy endings. 
TUVOK: I must say, Captain. Causing the alien ship to come to our aid was a very effective plot development. 
JANEWAY: Who says deus ex machina is an outdated literary device? 
PARIS: I'm just glad you didn't come down with a case of writer's block. 
TORRES: So, you two are going to have to come up with a new idea for your next literary collaboration. 
JANEWAY: What about doing a Western? 
TORRES: Or a detective story? 
CHAKOTAY: I don't care what kind of story it is, as long as I'm not the bad guy this time. 
NEELIX: I've got a great idea for a holonovel about a daring trader who becomes a cook on a starship. Eventually, he rises 
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, if Mister Paris and I do create another work of holo-fiction, I assure you we will choose a subject much less close to home.
