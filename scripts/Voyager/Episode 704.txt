The Voyager Transcripts - Repression
Repression
Stardate: 54090.4
Original Airdate: 25 October 2000
[Teero's room]
(There is a blueprint of Voyager hanging up. A Bajoran man looks at it then turns to his desk computer.) 
TEERO: The Prophets sing, this is a holy time. B'tanay, the time of awakening. Return to that dark place from which all life springs. A primal energy charges your blood, an energy of rebirth. The mind awakens and focuses on its task. Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. 
(He has the crew manifest of the Val Jean on his screen, a Maquis Raider. Torres, Chakotay, Ann somebody then Tuvok.) 
[Corridor]
Paris and Torres are in casual clothes.)
TORRES: Fresh flowers? An afternoon on the holodeck? It almost feels like we're dating again. 
PARIS: The secret to a lasting marriage. Keep the romance alive. 
TORRES: I'm not complaining. 
[Holodeck - cinema]
(A long room with a screen at one end and rows of seats. There are some people already seated. Paris has acquired a tray with a box of popcorn and some drinks.)
TORRES: Lecture hall? 
PARIS: Guess again. 
TORRES: Opera house? Not another one of the Doctor's performances. 
PARIS: This is a movie house. This is the Old Palace Theatre in Chicago, built in 1932. Look at the detail on that crown moulding. 
TORRES: It doesn't look very functional.
PARIS: This place isn't about function, it's about fantasy. 
(Torres steps on something sticky.) 
PARIS: Chewing gum.
TORRES: There is such a thing as too much authenticity. 
PARIS: Attention to detail. That's what makes it fun. 
(They sit.)
TORRES: Protective lenses?
PARIS: These will make the images on the screen appear three-dimensional. 
TORRES: Let me get this straight. You've gone to all this trouble to programme a three-dimensional environment that projects a two-dimensional image, and now you're asking me to wear these to make it look three-dimensional again?
PARIS: Great, isn't it? 
(The lights go down and film starts - Revenge of the Creature. Paris puts his arm along the back of Torres' seat.) 
TORRES: Crick in your neck? 
PARIS: People didn't go to the movies just for the movies, you know. 
TORRES: Really? What did they go for? 
PARIS: I'll try to demonstrate. 
(They smooch.)
TORRES: I can see why this was so popular. 
WOMAN: Shush!
TORRES: Maybe this would be more fun if we were alone. 
PARIS: Computer, delete audience. 
(One person remains.)
PARIS: Who's that in the front row? Must be a glitch. 
TORRES: No, That's Tabor.
FILM: This is an emergency! The Gill Man has escaped! Please, clear the oceanarium! Get out, everybody! 
(They go to the front row,)
PARIS: You okay?
(Tabor, a Bajoran, is just staring upwards.) 
[Sickbay]
EMH: He appears to be in a coma, but I'm reading unusual synaptic activity. 
CHAKOTAY: What happened to him? 
EMH: I don't know. I'd like to know what he's been doing the last few weeks. Where he's worked, away missions. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll access his duty roster. 
[Holodeck - cinema]
(Meanwhile, the investigation is underway at the crime scene. Tuvok hold up a pair of 3D glasses.)
TUVOK: Was Ensign Tabor wearing these when he was found? 
TORRES: No, they were on the floor next to him. 
PARIS: I don't think they cause comas.
TUVOK: Lights strobing at certain frequencies have been known to induce seizures. We should analyse the optical properties of this movie. When was the last time you spoke with Mister Tabor? 
PARIS: About ten, fifteen minutes before B'Elanna and I got here. He called to say the programme was up and running. 
TORRES: Funny. 
TUVOK: Lieutenant? 
TORRES: When we were in the Maquis together, we used to joke that Tabor must have had his own personal forcefield. He went through a dozen firefights without even getting his clothes dirty. 
TUVOK: He's still alive. Perhaps his forcefield is holding. 
KIM: Commander, I've reviewed the sensor logs for the four hours Tabor was in here. All systems were operating normally,;safeties were online. 
TUVOK: Run a level five diagnostic on the logs. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Tuvok. Report to Sickbay. 
TUVOK: On my way. 
[Sickbay]
EMH: I've found several microfractures in his cranium. They're minor, but the pattern suggests he suffered a trauma of some sort. There's also evidence of subdermal contusions along his right shoulder. 
CHAKOTAY: This man was attacked. 
JANEWAY: It's possible that whoever did this is still on board. Go to Yellow alert. Tuvok, I'm putting you in charge of the investigation. 
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. 
[Outside Tabor's quarters]
TUVOK: Security override Tuvok pi alpha. 
[Tabor's quarters]
(A woman is there.) 
JOR: Commander. 
TUVOK: Crewman Jor. If I'm not mistaken, your quarters are on deck four. 
JOR: I heard what happened to Tabor. I was looking for a book to bring to him. 
TUVOK: I'm afraid he's in no condition to read. 
JOR: I was going to read to him. I've heard it helps sometimes to hear a familiar voice. 
TUVOK: You and Tabor were friends. Do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt him? 
JOR: I can't imagine. 
TUVOK: Could you tell me where you were from oh seven hundred to eleven hundred hours this morning? 
JOR: On duty. In Engineering. You can check with Lieutenant Torres if you like.
TUVOK: That won't be necessary. Thank you, crewman. 
[Ready room]
CHAKOTAY: Harry's found evidence that someone tampered with the holodeck sensor logs. Several files have been deleted. 
JANEWAY: Any signs of an outside intruder? 
CHAKOTAY: No, nothing.
TUVOK: I believe that a member of this crew is responsible. 
JANEWAY: Tabor was well-liked. What's the motive? 
TUVOK: I have one suspect. Crewman Jor. 
CHAKOTAY: I find that hard to believe. I've known her for a long time. She and Tabor were friends. 
TUVOK: Close friends. She had access to his quarters. 
CHAKOTAY: A close relationship is hardly a crime. 
TUVOK: It is my experience that emotional involvements often lead to unpredictable behaviour. 
CHAKOTAY: That's an opinion, not evidence. 
TUVOK: There may be other suspects. I intend to question all crew members who had recent contact with Tabor. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll check the internal sensors. See what else I can find. 
(Chakotay leaves.)
JANEWAY: Commander. You seem awfully convinced that one of the crew was behind this. Now, you can't tell me that's the only logical conclusion, because I can think of a number of others. 
TUVOK: I realise that my assumptions seem premature, but I have a strong instinct about this. You might call it a hunch. 
JANEWAY: I didn't think that Vulcans had hunches. 
TUVOK: I can't explain it, Captain, but I can't ignore it either. Someone on board is responsible and I intend to find out who it is. 
[Engineering]
YOSA: Pressure's fluctuating in one one four. 
(Jor is standing on the upper level.)
JOR: You'd better check the seals. 
[Jeffries tube]
(Josa crawls into the tube and starts scanning. Suddenly the lights go out. 
YOSA: Yosa to Engineering. Engineering. 
(The sound of a hatch opening, then bright lights shine into his eyes.)
YOSA: Hello? 
(Yosa backs out of the tube.)
YOSA: Computer, seal hatch six one three beta. 
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. 
YOSA: Crewman Yosa to Security.
(The lights reach him.) 
[Sickbay]
(Yosa is on a biobed, staring at the ceiling.)
EMH: His neocortical readings are identical to Tabor's, and he has the same microfractures along his right temple. 
TUVOK: Who discovered him? 
JANEWAY: Crewman Jor. 
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Crewman Jor. Jor, respond. 
JANEWAY: Computer, locate Crewman Jor. 
COMPUTER: Crewman Jor is in the mess hall. 
[Mess hall]
(The lights are off, apart from the galley. Tuvok and Chakotay find Jor sitting, staring at the ceiling.)
TUVOK: Crewman Jor. 
[Sickbay]
EMH: If this keeps up, I may have to open a special coma ward. 
CHAKOTAY: Take a look at their names. Tell me if anything strikes you. 
JANEWAY: Former Maquis. 
CHAKOTAY: It's either a coincidence, or they're being singled out. 
JANEWAY: There hasn't been any hostility between the Maquis and the rest of the crew for years. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe someone on your crew couldn't put the past behind them. 
JANEWAY: My crew? 
CHAKOTAY: Our crew. 
JANEWAY: Are you any closer to a diagnosis, Doctor? 
[Doctor's office]
EMH: They all have the same disruptions in their synaptic pathways. The same cranial fractures, contusions. But I still don't know the cause, or how to reverse it. 
JANEWAY: Your investigation? 
TUVOK: Nothing conclusive. 
JANEWAY: Five crewmen in comas and we don't have a single clue? 
TUVOK: The assailant must have access to security protocols. There is no other way he could have escaped detection. 
EMH: You'd better find a way to protect the rest of the Maquis. I'm running out of beds. 
[Mess hall]
(Chakotay gathers the remains of his crew, including the two Bolians.)
CHELL: What is it you expect us to do?
CHAKOTAY: Stay alert. Report anything suspicious to Commander Tuvok. 
CHELL: I'd rather report to you, if it's all the same. 
CREWMAN: He's right. I've never trusted the Vulcan. He's betrayed us before.
TORRES: He was doing his job.
CREWMAN: He didn't care about the Maquis back then. Why should he now? 
TORRES: We're not Maquis anymore. 
CREWMAN: Tell that to our friends in Sickbay. 
TORRES: Oh, come on. We put our differences aside seven years ago. It's ancient history. 
CHELL: Maybe history is repeating itself. 
CHAKOTAY: Look, the truth is, we don't know what we're up against. But the last thing we need right now is an outbreak of paranoia. Now until we get to the bottom of this, I want you all to carry hand phasers. Nobody goes anywhere alone. 
[Holodeck]
PARIS: We thought maybe the intruder left behind some kind of negative image. 
KIM: Displaced photons. Tom figured that if we dampen the photonic ambience and enhance the polarity 
TUVOK: We can applaud Mister Paris' ingenuity later. What have you found? 
(Kim calls up a shadowy figure on the front row.)
TUVOK: Ensign Tabor. 
KIM: Now take a look at this. 
(A second figure appears, bending over Tabor.) 
TUVOK: Impressive. 
KIM: It doesn�t tell us who the attacker was, but we do know someone else was here. 
TUVOK: Can you extrapolate the assailant's height and weight? 
KIM: I�d say between a hundred seventy and a hundred ninety centimetres. Maybe seventy five kilograms. 
PARIS: That describes about half the members of the crew. 
KIM: At least we can rule out Naomi Wildman. 
TUVOK: Is it possible to increase the resolution? 
KIM: We're already working on it. 
TUVOK: Keep me informed. 
(Tuvok stops and turns to gaze at the images.)
PARIS: Commander? 
[Corridor]
(Chell keeps looking behind him.)
TORRES: Stop it. You're making me nervous.
CHELL: It doesn't make sense. This ship, with all its sensors. How could five people be attacked without leaving a trace? 
TORRES: Good question.
CHELL: Maybe it's a conspiracy. Ever since Voyager began sending datastreams back home, Starfleet has known that almost a quarter of the crew is Maquis. 
TORRES: So? 
CHELL: Maybe they think we're still dangerous. Maybe they ordered the Captain to neutralise the threat. 
TORRES: Yes, that's it. She's putting us all into stasis. The comas are just a cover story. 
CHELL: It would be easier than putting us all in the brig. 
[Turbolift]
(Seven exits and Torres enters.) 
CHELL: It could be her.
TORRES: Oh, please. 
[Tuvok's office]
TUVOK: That'll be all, Crewman. Please send in Mister Kim. 
(The crewman leaves. Kim enters.)
KIM: I'm still trying to enhance the photon displacement. 
TUVOK: I appreciate your efforts, Mister Kim, but I called you here for another reason. In the last datastream from Earth, you received a letter from someone named Dennis Kim. 
KIM: My cousin. 
TUVOK: In that letter, he spoke of your mutual friend, Maxwell Saroyan. 
KIM: You read my mail? 
TUVOK: Yes. 
KIM: Isn't that a violation of privacy protocols? 
TUVOK: As the Chief of Security, I have the authority to suspend those protocols under special circumstances. 
KIM: And what is so special about a letter from my cousin? 
TUVOK: The attacks began shortly after we received the last datastream. Your letter was part of that transmission. 
KIM: A lot of people got letters. 
TUVOK: Twenty eight, to be exact, but only six of them matched the physical parameters of the photon displacement. 
KIM: Am I a suspect? 
TUVOK: According to the letter, your friend, Mister Saroyan, was killed by the Maquis a number of years ago. 
KIM: You got me, Tuvok. I confess. I was so distraught after hearing Max's name that I fired my Captain Proton Comatizer at every Maquis I could find. 
TUVOK: Your sarcasm could be viewed as subterfuge. 
KIM: Tuvok, it's me, Harry. Do you really think I'd be capable of this? 
TUVOK: My personal views are irrelevant. 
KIM: I learned about Max's death a long time ago. I was upset, but I don't blame the Maquis, and I certainly don't blame anyone on this ship. If that'll be all?
(Tuvok is lost in thought.)
KIM: Is everything all right? 
TUVOK: This investigation is perplexing. It defies logic. 
KIM: I'll keep you posted on the holodeck analysis. 
EMH [OC]: Doctor to Commander Tuvok. Report to Sickbay immediately. 
TUVOK: On my way. 
[Sickbay]
EMH: I thought you might like to have a few words with Mister Tabor. 
TUVOK: How did you revive him? 
EMH: I didn't. His synaptic pathways stabilised on their own. 
TUVOK: How do you feel? 
TABOR: Fine, sir. Hungry. 
TUVOK: What do you remember? 
TABOR: Not much. I was working in the holodeck, and then I was here. 
TUVOK: Was anyone in the holodeck with you? 
TABOR: No, sir. 
TUVOK: Do you know why anyone would want to hurt you? 
TABOR: No. What's going on? 
TUVOK: Thank you, Ensign. 
[Corridor]
CHAKOTAY: Crewman, I remember ordering everyone to work in pairs. Where's your partner? 
CHELL: Er, she's, er, er. 
CHAKOTAY: Who's your partner? 
CHELL: Lieutenant Torres. I told her we shouldn't split up, sir, but she said she could handle herself. You know how stubborn she can be. 
CHAKOTAY: I have a vague idea. Do you know where she went? 
CHELL: Cargo Bay two, sir.
(Chakotay hands off his Vulcan lady escort to Chell.) 
[Cargo Bay two]
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna? Computer, locate Lieutenant Torres. 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Torres is in Cargo Bay two. 
(Chakotay finds her down the back, behind some containers. He looks up and sees Tuvok standing nearby.)
CHAKOTAY: Help me get her to Sickbay. 
TUVOK: This is a holy time. 
CHAKOTAY: What? 
(Chakotay draws his phaser, but Tuvok hits him, knocking him against the wall.) 
CHAKOTAY: Security to Cargo Bay two. 
(Tuvok pummels Chakotay then initiates a mind meld.)
TUVOK: Let the mind awaken and focus on the task. My mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Chakotay and B'Elanna are the latest victims of our mysterious assailant. I've decided to put the ship on a Level ten security alert. Non-essential personnel are confined to quarters, and security teams have been posted on all decks. 
[Cargo Bay two]
(Tuvok puts some evidence into a case.)
TUVOK: Ensign, run a metallurgical analysis. 
JANEWAY: Two more victims regained consciousness. Crewmen Yosa and Jor. Their bio-readings returned to normal, as if they suffered nothing worse than a good night's sleep. It doesn't make any sense. 
TUVOK: It is, however, a pattern, and a pattern implies purpose. We simply have to uncover it. 
JANEWAY: Any clues here? 
TUVOK: Not yet. 
JANEWAY: I'm beginning to think our perpetrator is a ghost. 
TUVOK: Perhaps we should conduct a s�ance. 
JANEWAY: It couldn't hurt. 
TUVOK: I have worked meticulously, yet he has outwitted me each time. 
JANEWAY: How can you be sure it's a he? 
TUVOK: I can't, but I am. 
JANEWAY: Another hunch? 
TUVOK: I can almost sense his presence. It's as though he's challenging me to find him.
JANEWAY: I'd say you're taking this a little too personally. Maybe you should take a break. 
TUVOK: No. 
JANEWAY: You haven't slept in three days. Get some rest, Meditate. Clear your mind.
TUVOK: My mind is perfectly clear. 
JANEWAY: I don't want to make this an order, Tuvok. I'll go over your scans. Fresh pair of eyes might help. 
TUVOK: Captain. 
[Tuvok's quarters]
(Tuvok lights his meditation lamp and kneels on a big cushion. He has sepia visions of the victims in Sickbay, Tabor in the cinema, Yosa in the Jefferies tube, Chakotay. He abandons the meditation and staggers to the bathroom. He remembers Chakotay hitting him, and lifts his tunic to see the big bruise it left. In the mirror, he sees a Bajoran standing behind him.) 
TEERO: Resist your doubts.
(There is no one there. Tuvok leaves his quarters.) 
[Corridor]
TEERO [OC]: Don't question your mission. 
[Holodeck - cinema]
JANEWAY: Filter out the polarised photons. Anyone you know? Tuvok. 
TUVOK: Computer, isolate the precise time index of this image. 
COMPUTER: Stardate 54090.4. 
TUVOK: Where was Commander Tuvok at that time? 
COMPUTER: Access to that information has been restricted. 
TUVOK: By whom? 
COMPUTER: Access to that information has been restricted. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok, what's going on? 
TUVOK: Computer, override those security restrictions. Authorisation Tuvok pi alpha. 
COMPUTER: Restrictions overridden.
TUVOK: Where was Commander Tuvok at the specified time? 
COMPUTER: Commander Tuvok was in holodeck two. 
TUVOK: Computer, based on the most recent data, can you give me a better estimation of the intruder's height? 
COMPUTER: One hundred eighty two centimetres. 
TUVOK: And what is the height of Lieutenant Commander Tuvok? 
COMPUTER: One hundred eighty two centimetres. 
TUVOK: Captain, I believe I 
(Tuvok sees Teero standing behind Kim and Janeway, and draws his phaser.) 
TEERO: Ignore your doubts.
(Kim draws his weapon but Janeway stays his hand.)
TUVOK: No. 
JANEWAY: Commander, lower your weapon. 
TEERO: Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. 
TUVOK: Who are you? 
(Janeway takes Tuvok's phaser.) 
TUVOK: Captain, it would appear that I am the guilty party. 
JANEWAY: How is that possible? 
TUVOK: I don't know. But for the safety of the crew you must confine me to the brig. 
[Brig]
(Tuvok is meditating while the EMH scans him.)
EMH: He wants to speak with you, but I advise you to remain outside the forcefield. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok, can you hear me? 
TUVOK: I hear you. But there is another voice trying to control me. 
JANEWAY: Another voice? Whose? This is a holy time. What did you mean by that? 
TUVOK: A primal energy charges the blood, an energy of rebirth. 
JANEWAY: That's what the voice is telling you? 
TUVOK: It's a Bajoran incantation. The voice is Bajoran. 
EMH: We need to get you to Sickbay so I can run 
TUVOK: No! No more scans. Leave me alone. 
TEERO: Don't question your mission. 
TUVOK: Get away from me. 
JANEWAY: What do you see, Tuvok? 
TUVOK: The Bajoran. 
(Janeway steps into Tuvok's line of sight.)
JANEWAY: Ignore him. Focus on my voice. Tell me what's happening. 
TUVOK: I believe I've, I've been attacking certain members of the crew. The Maquis. Then investigating the crimes with no memory of what I'd done. 
EMH: Attacking them how? 
TUVOK: Mind melds. 
JANEWAY: Why? 
TUVOK: I don't know. He is responsible. What did you do to me? 
JANEWAY: Commander. Commander. Is he a member of the crew? Then who is he? 
TUVOK: I don't know. 
JANEWAY: The day the first attack occurred, did anything unusual happen to you? 
TUVOK: I was tending to my duties. I received a letter from my son. 
JANEWAY: A letter? This all started right after we received the last datastream. 
TUVOK: I reviewed every letter except my own. 
JANEWAY: Stay with him, Doctor. 
[Sickbay]
(Chakotay sits up in bed.)
CHAKOTAY: How long? 
PARIS: Twenty nine hours. She woke up just before you did. 
JANEWAY: They've all recovered. We don't know why. It's Tuvok. 
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok? 
JANEWAY: He's in the brig. Apparently, he's being manipulated by some form of mind control. Can he leave, Mister Paris? 
PARIS: I don't see why not, but he should wear one of these. 
(The ubiquitous cortical monitor.)
JANEWAY: There's something I want to show you. 
[Astrometrics lab]
(Tuvok's son is a mature teenager.)
SEK [on screen]: Exo-linguistics always seemed a little too theoretical to me. I've decided to study musical composition instead. I would have sent you my latest polytonal construct, but they wouldn't give me enough room in this datastream. Maybe next time, I can. 
CHAKOTAY: A letter from his son. 
JANEWAY: We found another signal embedded in the message. A letter within a letter. 
SEK [on screen]: Hello, Father. We received your last transmission. 
TEERO [on screen]: This is a holy time. B'tanay, the time of awakening. Return to that dark place from which all life springs. 
SEVEN: The signal is calibrated to correspond with Vulcan synaptic frequencies. Tuvok wouldn't have been consciously aware of it. 
CHAKOTAY: Teero. Teero Anaydis. He was a Bajoran Vedek. He worked with the Maquis. 
JANEWAY: Doing what? 
CHAKOTAY: Counter-intelligence. He was thrown out for experimenting with mind control. He thought it was a good way to recruit agents. 
JANEWAY: Well, apparently he was successful at recruiting our Tactical Officer. These incantations and symbols, they must have triggered something in Tuvok. Preconditioned behaviour, instructions. 
CHAKOTAY: I should've known you'd show up again. 
JANEWAY: Commander? 
CHAKOTAY: Teero was a fanatic. He'd go to any extreme for the Maquis. He called the rest of us traitors for rejecting his ideas. Swore he'd fight the war on his own if he had to. 
SEVEN: Why instruct Tuvok to mind meld with Voyager's Maquis thirty five thousand light years from Earth? 
JANEWAY: I'd like Tuvok to take a look at this message. Maybe it'll jog his memory. (to Seven) Try to decode those symbols. 
[Brig]
(Tuvok is looking at a PADD.)
TUVOK: It's him. 
JANEWAY: His name is Teero Anaydis. 
TUVOK: Teero. 
JANEWAY: He worked for Maquis Intelligence. 
TUVOK: Yes, I remember meeting him. I was undercover, doing reconnaissance on a colony near the Badlands. He was a Vedek at the Bajoran temple there. 
JANEWAY: Go on. 
TUVOK: We spoke briefly. He was interested in Vulcan culture. That's all I remember. 
JANEWAY: Maybe that's all he wanted you to remember. He was developing some kind of mind control technique. We think he used it on you seven years ago. 
(Tuvok has a quick sepia vision of himself.)
JANEWAY: What is it?
TUVOK: I, I was restrained. Very frightened. 
JANEWAY: What did he do to you? 
TUVOK: I can't remember. 
JANEWAY: Try. 
TUVOK: I can't! 
(Tuvok curls up in the corner of his cell.)
JANEWAY: Tuvok, if we're going to help you, we need to find out. The last time you meditated, it helped the memories resurface, didn't it? You've helped me meditate. I think I've learned a thing or two about the process. Let me try to guide you. 
(The forcefield is lowered, and Janeway enters the cell. A short time later, Tuvok is kneeling.) 
JANEWAY: Where are you? 
TUVOK: In a laboratory. Underground. 
[Memory - Teero's lab]
(Tuvok is strapped to a table, with blinkies on his forehead.) 
JANEWAY [OC]: Is Teero there? 
TUVOK [OC]: There is someone. It's him. 
JANEWAY [OC]: Describe what's happening. 
TEERO: Lieutenant. 
[Brig]
JANEWAY: Tuvok? Tuvok? 
[Memory - Teero's lab]
TEERO: It is Lieutenant, isn't it? I'm sure your Maquis comrades would be interested to know your Starfleet rank. Don't worry, I don't plan to expose you. 
TUVOK: What do you want? 
TEERO: You. You're the perfect subject. 
TUVOK: For what?
TEERO: I'm a student of the mind. Yours is remarkable. Disciplined, orderly. On the surface, that is. Beneath 
(Teero injects Tuvok.)
TEERO: Boiling emotions, repressed violence. In a sense, you're two different men. One I could never hope to manipulate, but the other
TUVOK: I have been trained to resist mind control. 
TEERO: That's the rational, logical part of you at work, but I want to reach your inner fire. Your spirit. 
TUVOK: Why? Wait. Please, please, don't. 
(Teero jabs a pulsing needle into a device on Tuvok's forehead.)
TEERO: Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. 
[Brig]
(Tuvok leaps up and backs into a corner.)
TUVOK: Stay away from me! 
JANEWAY: Tuvok. 
TEERO: Complete your mission. 
TUVOK: No! 
TEERO: This is a holy time. 
JANEWAY: Commander. 
(Tuvok pushes Janeway across the cell. She holds up her hand to stop the guard from firing his phaser. Against protocol, Tuvok still has his comm. badge.)
TUVOK: Tuvok to Chakotay. 
[Astrometrics lab]
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. 
TUVOK [OC]: Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. 
CHAKOTAY: Understood. 
[Brig]
JANEWAY: Janeway to Chakotay. Commander. Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. What did that mean, Tuvok? Tell me. 
TUVOK: This is a holy time. A time of awakening. 
JANEWAY: This Teero has awakened you to do what? If you can remember, you can fight him. You can resist. What does he want? 
TUVOK: To give us instructions. 
JANEWAY: What kind of instructions? 
TEERO: Focus on your task.
TUVOK: No. 
(Chakotay's cortical monitor is going berserk.) 
[Sickbay]
EMH: It's Chakotay. 
PARIS: What is it? 
EMH: I'm not sure. Sickbay to Commander Chakotay. Computer, locate Chakotay. 
COMPUTER: Commander Chakotay is in sickbay. 
(Only just. Chakotay is entering.)
CHAKOTAY: Computer, deactivate the EMH. 
PARIS: Commander? 
(Chakotay phasers Paris. Torres sits up.)
CHAKOTAY: Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. 
(He rips off his cortical monitor.)
TORRES: I understand. 
(Torres and the other Maquis have armed themselves with phaser rifles. The group splits up in a corridor.) 
[Turbolift]
CHAKOTAY: Deck one. 
[Brig]
JANEWAY: Why were you using mind melds? What did Teero want you to do? 
TUVOK: To awaken the others. 
TEERO: Resist your doubts. 
TUVOK: No! 
JANEWAY: Focus on me. 
TEERO: Complete your mission. Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. 
TUVOK: You don't control me! 
[Bridge]
KIM: Good to see you, Commander. 
CHAKOTAY: It's good to be back. 
(Chakotay shoots Kim. He and his escort shoot the rest of the bridge crew.) 
[Brig]
(Red alert is sounding.)
JANEWAY: Janeway to the bridge. Report.
(Tuvok is sitting very still. The forcefield is lowered and Janeway steps out of the cell. Torres and her group take over Engineering by force.) 
[Corridor]
(A phaser shot hits the security guard from the brig in the back.)
JANEWAY: What the hell are you doing? 
CHAKOTAY: I think it's obvious. I'm taking control of your ship. Within the hour all Starfleet personnel will be locked in their quarters. Step back in the Brig, Kathryn. 
JANEWAY: What's Teero done to you? 
CHAKOTAY: He simply helped us remember who we are. We're Maquis. We've always been Maquis.
JANEWAY: The rebellion ended three years ago. You know that. 
CHAKOTAY: In the Alpha Quadrant, maybe. Not on this ship. 
TORRES [OC]: Torres to Chakotay. 
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. 
TORRES [OC]: Deck eleven is secure. 
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. 
[Brig]
JANEWAY: We're thirty five light years from Earth, Chakotay. No one out here even knows about the Maquis. It doesn't make sense. There's nothing you can accomplish. 
CHAKOTAY: As long as we exist, so does the rebellion. 
JANEWAY: That's Teero talking. He was unstable, you said so yourself. 
CHAKOTAY: We have no intention of hurting any of you. 
(Janeway is put into the cell with Tuvok and the unconscious guard. Tuvok looks at Janeway then turns to Chakotay.)
TUVOK: Your orders, Captain? 
CHAKOTAY: Take your station. 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Captain's log, stardate 54101. Voyager is now under my command. We're en route to an M class planet where we'ill relocate the Starfleet crew. 
[Bridge]
(The Maquis are in their preferred clothes, not uniforms.)
JOR: We're in range.;
TORRES: On screen. Looks like a nice place for a Federation colony. Take us into orbit. 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Tuvok, would you mind joining me in the ready room? 
[Ready room]
TUVOK: You wished to see me, Captain? 
CHAKOTAY: You can drop the formalities. This is a Maquis ship now. Vulcan brandy. I thought we'd have a drink to celebrate. 
TUVOK: A fitting gesture. 
(Ayala is standing guard.)
CHAKOTAY: To awakenings. 
TUVOK: Awakenings. 
CHAKOTAY: There are still twenty three of our former comrades who aren't with us yet. I was hoping you'd be able to help persuade them. 
TUVOK: I'm prepared to mind meld with the remaining Maquis to convey Teero's instructions. 
CHAKOTAY: It'll be nice to have my old crew back. You've been a big help to us, Tuvok, but I can't forget what happened seven years ago. You have a history of betraying the Maquis. 
TUVOK: It won't happen again. 
CHAKOTAY: We have a small crew. I have to be able to trust everyone, especially my tactical officer. 
(He taps his comm. badge.)
CHAKOTAY: Bring her in. 
(Janeway is brought in at gunpoint. Chakotay hands Tuvok his own hand phaser.)
CHAKOTAY: Consider this a test of your loyalty. It's set to kill. 
JANEWAY: You said you wouldn't hurt anyone. (Tuvok sets down his glass.)
JANEWAY: You're in control of your actions. Not Chakotay, not Teero. 
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok?
JANEWAY: Don't do this. 
(Tuvok fires the phaser at Janeway. It stutters.)
TUVOK: This phaser is defective. 
CHAKOTAY: Take her back to the brig. 
(Janeway is escorted out.)
CHAKOTAY: You passed. 
(Ayala leaves them alone.) 
CHAKOTAY: Now, we've got some tactical issues to review. I want to re-route all weapons control to my console. 
(Tuvok neck-pinches him, then does a mind meld.) 
TUVOK: My mind to your mind. My thoughts to your thoughts. 
[Bridge]
(Chakotay returns to the bridge with Tuvok.)
TORRES: Kim and Paris engineered a little breakout on deck six. We've contained them all behind a forcefield. 
JOR: We should begin the evacuation. 
TORRES: Start beaming them down. Begin on deck two, section zero one. 
CHAKOTAY: Belay that order. Tuvok informed me that this planet has an unstable atmosphere. Go to Astrometrics and scan for an alternative. 
TORRES: What are you talking about? There's nothing wrong with the atmosphere. 
CHAKOTAY: We don't have time to debate this. 
TORRES: I can scan from here. Chakotay, what's going on? 
(Torres reaches for her phaser. Everybody draws theirs.)
TUVOK: Stand down. 
[Brig]
TUVOK: Your weapon. 
(The guard gives it up. The cell forcefield is lowered.)
CHAKOTAY: I thought you might like your ship back. 
JANEWAY: No more rebellion?
CHAKOTAY: It took another mind meld with Tuvok, but I'm fine. 
JANEWAY: Tuvok, you're all right. 
TUVOK: I am in control again, Captain. 
CHAKOTAY: Whatever you said to him, it worked. 
JANEWAY: It's good to have you back, Commander. 
[Corridor]
CHAKOTAY: All ready for Attack of the Lobster People? 
TUVOK: I am not familiar with that species. 
CHAKOTAY: You will be, soon enough. 
TUVOK: I haven't completed my security rounds. 
(Chakotay takes his PADD.)
CHAKOTAY: You have now. 
[Holodeck - cinema]
(Neelix offers a choice of popcorn.)
NEELIX: Buttered or unbuttered? 
CHAKOTAY: Thank you, Neelix. 
(Janeway waves to Tuvok.)
JANEWAY: I saved you a seat. 
TUVOK: How long is this entertainment? 
JANEWAY: I'm not sure. Tom said something about a double feature. I've been meaning to ask you. How did you know that phaser wasn't charged? 
TUVOK: Chakotay doubted my loyalty. He wouldn't have given me an active weapon. 
JANEWAY: Not exactly ironclad logic. 
(The lights go down.)
TUVOK: Call it a hunch. 
JANEWAY: Remind me to pay more attention to your hunches. 
TORRES: Shush!
(They put on their 3D glasses.)
