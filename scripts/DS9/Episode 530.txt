The Deep Space Nine Transcripts - Sacrifice of Angels
Sacrifice of Angels
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 3 Nov, 1997
Last time on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.
SISKO: The Dominion won't attack Earth. 
SITAK: How can you be sure? 
SISKO: Because Earth isn't the key to the Alpha Quadrant. The wormhole is. And whoever controls Deep Space Nine controls the wormhole. 
O'BRIEN: Target locked. 
DAX: Fire. 
(KaBOOM) 
KIRA: Execute Rom? 
WEYOUN: He committed an act of terrorism against the Dominion. 
ROM: You've got to finish what I started. The fate of the entire Alpha Quadrant rests in your hands. 
QUARK: What happens if I get caught? 
(Odo and the female shape-shifter Link.) 
ROSS: If those Dominion reinforcements come through the wormhole we'll have lost everything. 
SISKO: We take the ships we have, fight our way to Deep Space Nine and destroy that anti-graviton emitter. It's our only hope. 
KIRA: Dukat is bringing down the minefield, the Federation is about to be overrun by Dominion reinforcements and Weyoun has ordered Rom's execution. 
ODO: I'm sorry. 
KIRA: We are way, way past sorry. 
O'BRIEN: It's a large Dominion fleet. Twelve hundred and fifty four ships. 
BASHIR: They outnumber us two to one. 
SISKO: There's an old saying, fortune favours the bold. Well, I guess we're about to find out. 
And now the conclusion.
[Bridge]
SISKO: Sisko to all ships. Cruiser and Galaxy wings, drop to half impulse. You too, Commander. 
DAX: Half impulse. 
GARAK: I feel sorry for the Klingons. They're going to miss a very interesting fight. 
O'BRIEN: I have a feeling we're going to miss having them. 
SISKO: Forget the Klingons. Our job is to get to Deep Space Nine and prevent the Dominion reinforcements from coming through the wormhole, and that's what we're going to do. Attack fighters, tactical pattern Theta. Concentrate your fire on the Cardassian ships, and then split off into squadrons and run like hell. 
NOG: Why is he only targeting the Cardassian ships? 
GARAK: He's hoping to get them to break formation and so they'll after the Federation fighters. He knows the Jem'Hadar will stand their ground, but the Cardassians just might get angry enough to take the bait. 
NOG: Which would open a hole we can punch through. 
GARAK: You're getting quite an education. 
NOG: Attack fighters in Theta formation. Cruiser and Galaxy wings at half impulse. 
SISKO: Sisko to attack fighters. Prepare to engage on my command. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
O'BRIEN: Cannon to the right of them, cannon to the left of them, cannon in front of them, volley'd and thunder'd. 
BASHIR: Storm'd at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well into the jaws of death. Into the mouth of hell rode the six hundred. 
NOG: Whatever it is you two are reciting, I wish you'd stop. 
O'BRIEN: Steady, Ensign. It's just a poem. 
(
Here's the full text, if you need it
.) 
NOG: It's not the poem that's bothering me. 
O'BRIEN: Stop worrying about those ships. Focus on your work. That's what I do. 
BASHIR: You should listen to him, Ensign. He's a professional. 
SISKO: Attack fighters full impulse. Fire at will. 
(And so it begins. The battle continues during the opening titles.) 
O'BRIEN: They're not taking the bait. 
SISKO: Ensign, send in the second wave. Tell them to keep targeting the Cardassians. 
NOG: Aye, sir. Second wave on its way. Third and fourth waves on hot standby. 
SISKO: Mister O'Brien, have Destroyer units two and six move in closer. They need more cover fire. And tell Captains Diego and Reynolds to stay alert. They may try to outflank us. 
[Ops]
(Dukat and co are watching the battle on the Ops table.) 
DUKAT: It's very clever strategy. But I'd expect nothing less from Captain Sisko. 
WEYOUN: The Captain is a very clever man. 
DUKAT: You do see it, don't you? 
WEYOUN: Of course I do. 
DUKAT: Well then, perhaps you'd like to explain Captain Sisko's strategy to the Founder yourself. 
WEYOUN: I could never hope to match your eloquence. 
DUKAT: True. Sisko is trying to provoke us into opening a hole in our lines. He's determined to get here and stop us from taking down this minefield. Now I plan to give Sisko his opening and then close it on him. 
WEYOUN: What about the minefield? Are we still on schedule? 
DUKAT: We should be able to detonate the mines in eight hours. 
FOUNDER: Good. 
WEYOUN: Eight hours. I'll hold you to that, Dukat. 
(The Founder and Weyoun leave.) 
DAMAR: I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. 
DUKAT: Now, now, Damar, that's no way to talk about our valued allies. Not until this war is over, anyway. 
DAMAR: Sir, there is one other thing. 
DUKAT: Make it brief. 
DAMAR: I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. 
DUKAT: By enemy, I assume you're referring to Rom's associates? 
DAMAR: I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. 
DUKAT: What are you proposing? 
DAMAR: That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. 
DUKAT: It's a wise precaution. But our Bajoran allies might object to an arrest without cause. If anyone asks, we're merely holding them for questioning. And Damar, make sure they're not harmed in any way. Major Kira is important to my daughter. And to me. 
DAMAR: Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. 
DUKAT: For what reason? 
DAMAR: To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. 
DUKAT: Are you accusing my daughter of being a saboteur? 
DAMAR: I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. 
DUKAT: That will be all, Damar. 
DAMAR: She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. 
DUKAT: But she is my daughter. That may mean nothing to you, but it means everything to me. 
[Quark's]
LEETA: I heard the Federation fleet has been ambushed. 
QUARK: I heard two Cardassian soldiers saying the fleet was completely destroyed. 
JAKE: Don't believe everything you hear. 
KIRA: Jake's right. Sisko'll get here. The question is, will he get here soon enough? 
QUARK: He's only got seven hours before they detonate the minefield and start bringing the reinforcements through the wormhole. 
JAKE: We've got to stop them. 
LEETA: How? 
KIRA: What if we cut off the power supply to the main computer? Shut down the whole station. 
QUARK: Oh great. That would put me out of business altogether. 
JAKE: It would also keep them from detonating the mines. 
QUARK: Okay, so we shut down the main computer. How? 
KIRA: A bomb. 
QUARK: A bomb? What kind of bomb? 
KIRA: Leave that to me. It'll be crude, but effective. 
QUARK: The main computer is in the central core. It's too heavily guarded. You'll never be able to smuggle a bomb into there. 
(Quark leaves) 
KIRA: I'll plant the bomb. All we need to do is distract the guards. 
DAMAR [OC]: In here. Secure the doors. 
(Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) 
DAMAR: Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. 
KIRA: I'm off duty, Damar. What do you want? 
DAMAR: I want you to come with us. All three of you. 
KIRA: Where? 
DAMAR: To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. 
JAKE: What kind of questions? 
DAMAR: You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. 
KIRA: Don't worry. It'll be all right. 
DAMAR: Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. 
[Ops]
DAMAR: I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. 
DUKAT: Well, his persistence is about to pay off. Let's give him his reward, shall we? Have a half dozen squadrons break formation and go after those fighters. 
DAMAR: Yes, sir. 
[Bridge]
O'BRIEN: Captain, two squadrons of Cardassian attack ships are breaking formation. They're going after our fighters. 
GARAK: They're taking the bait. We've opened a hole in their lines. 
SISKO: Have we? 
DAX: Sir, do you see those Galor class destroyers? 
SISKO: I see them. 
BASHIR: It's a trap. 
SISKO: It is also an opportunity and we may not get another one. Ensign, have Galaxy wings nine one and nine three engage those destroyers. All other ships, head for that opening. Anyone who gets through doesn't stop until they reach Deep Space Nine. 
(In they go, Galaxy-class firepower helping make the gap wide enough for the Defiant and her companions.) 
GARAK: Congratulations, Captain. You wanted them angry, they're angry. 
SISKO: The Magellan and the Venture are supposed to be protecting our starboard flanks. They're in too tight. Ensign, tell fighter squadrons six, seven and eight to 
NOG: Sir, I can't get through to anybody. Communications are down. 
O'BRIEN: They're jamming our signals by generating a rotating EM pulse. 
SISKO: Can you clear it? 
O'BRIEN: I'm trying. 
[Captain's office]
DUKAT: War is such thirsty work. Don't you agree? 
WEYOUN: Perhaps if you didn't talk so much, your throat wouldn't get so dry. 
DUKAT: Cardassians do like to talk. I suppose it can be a failing at times. 
(Dukat offers Weyoun a glass of kanar.) 
WEYOUN: No. 
DUKAT: To the conquerors of the Federation. 
WEYOUN: Aren't you being a bit premature? 
DUKAT: I don't think so. Not with twenty eight hundred Dominion ships waiting to come through that wormhole. 
WEYOUN: Those ships aren't going to be here for another five hours, and need I remind you a lot can happen in that amount of time. 
DUKAT: Tell me, Weyoun, have you ever been diagnosed as anhedonic? 
WEYOUN: You think I'm incapable of experiencing joy just because I'm cautious? 
DUKAT: We didn't defeat the Federation by being cautious. 
WEYOUN: We haven't defeated it yet. And even if we do, it's only the beginning. Holding on to a prize as vast as the Federation isn't going to be easy. It's going to require an enormous number of ships, a massive occupation army and constant vigilance. 
DUKAT: I look forward to it. 
WEYOUN: I'm sure you also looked forward to occupying Bajor and we all know what a disappointment that was. 
DUKAT: On Bajor I merely implemented policy, I didn't make it. If I had, things would have turned out quite differently. 
WEYOUN: If you ask me, the key to holding the Federation is Earth. If there's going to be an organised resistance against us, its birthplace will be there. 
DUKAT: You could be right. 
WEYOUN: Then our first step is be to eradicate its population. It's the only way. 
DUKAT: You can't do that. 
WEYOUN: Why not? 
DUKAT: Because! A true victory is to make your enemy see they were wrong to oppose you in the first place. To force them to acknowledge your greatness. 
WEYOUN: Then you kill them? 
DUKAT: Only if it's necessary. 
WEYOUN: I had no idea. 
DUKAT: Perhaps the biggest disappointment in my life is that the Bajoran people still refuse to appreciate how lucky they were to have me as their liberator. I protected them in so many ways, cared for them as if they were my own children. But to this day, is there a single statue of me on Bajor? 
WEYOUN: I would guess not. 
DUKAT: And you'd be right. Take Captain Sisko, an otherwise intelligent, perceptive man. Even he refuses to grant me the respect I deserve. 
(Dukat drops the baseball onto the floor.) 
DUKAT: You find that amusing? 
WEYOUN: Not at all. I find it fascinating. 
DUKAT: Laugh all you want. History will prove me right. 
[Odo's quarters]
FOUNDER: I have news, Odo. Our battle with the Federation fleet is going well. 
ODO: There are people out there fighting, dying. People who used to be my friends. 
FOUNDER: They're solids, Odo. You must remember that. 
ODO: I know, but they still mean something to me. 
FOUNDER: The Link means more. 
ODO: That's what I keep telling myself, but somehow I can't quite believe it. 
FOUNDER: You asked me for clarity, Odo. I gave it to you. Now you must accept it. It's Major Kira, isn't it? You still have strong feelings for her. She doesn't deserve your loyalty, Odo. You cannot allow a solid to deny you your rightful place in the Great Link. I couldn't permit it. 
ODO: What are you saying? 
FOUNDER: The Major has been arrested. 
ODO: On what charge? 
FOUNDER: That hardly matters. What matters is she will be found guilty and sentenced to death. 
ODO: No! 
FOUNDER: Her death is be your salvation. Link with me. Embrace the clarity. It is the only thing that will give you peace. 
ODO: No. 
FOUNDER: You cannot help her, Odo. You cannot help any of the solids, no matter how much you may want to. It's too late for them. 
[Bridge]
(Starfleet ships are being ripped apart. Defiant is under constant bombardment.) 
DAX: Sir, we've just lost the Sitak and the Majestic. We're on our own, Ben. 
O'BRIEN: Comm's back online. 
NOG: Four enemy ships directly ahead. 
SISKO: Evasive manoeuvres, pattern Omega. We're going through. 
(Defiant weaves between the big Cardassian ships, pursued by Jem'Hadar fighters.) 
DAX: That's one down. 
SISKO: Can you shake the other three? 
DAX: I'm trying. 
BASHIR: We've lost aft shields. Forward shields are down to fifteen percent. 
GARAK: Wouldn't this be a good time to cloak? 
O'BRIEN: The cloaking system's fried. 
SISKO: Auxiliary power to weapons. We're going to fight our way out of this. 
(KaBOOM, KaBOOM, KaBOOM as the Klingons arrive.) 
NOG: It's the Klingons, sir. They're here. We're being hailed by Commander Worf. 
SISKO: On screen. 
WORF [on viewscreen]: Captain, I am sorry we were late. It was not easy to convince Chancellor Gowron to spare us any ships. 
SISKO: I'm just glad you could join us, Commander. 
O'BRIEN: Captain, the Klingons have broken a hole in the Dominion lines. 
SISKO: Dax, can you get us through? 
DAX: I'd love to try. 
(Their Klingon escort is demolished as Defiant weaves through the enemy to clear space beyond.) 
SISKO: Any other ships make it? 
NOG: No, sir. 
SISKO: We only have three hours before the minefields are detonated. Set a course for Deep Space Nine. Maximum warp. 
[Ops]
DAMAR: The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? 
WEYOUN: At once. 
DUKAT: (fondling the baseball) The Defiant is no match for this station. If Sisko wants to commit suicide, I say we let him. 
[Ziyal's quarters]
(Ziyal enters and is grabbed from behind by Quark.) 
QUARK: Don't scream. I won't going to hurt you. 
(She nods and he releases her.) 
QUARK: I just have one question. 
ZIYAL: What's that? 
QUARK: Do you know how to make hasperat souffl�? 
[Security office]
(Quark and Ziyal enter with tray of food.) 
QUARK: Lunch for Major Kira. 
CARDASSIAN: Major Kira has already been fed. 
QUARK: And I can only imagine the slop you served her. What I have here is hasperat souffl�, just the way the Major likes it. 
CARDASSIAN: This is a jail, not a hotel. The Major will eat what the other prisoners eat. 
ZIYAL: Do you know who I am? 
CARDASSIAN: Gul Dukat's daughter. 
ZIYAL: That's right. Now I suggest you allow us to deliver this food. 
CARDASSIAN: I can't do that. However, I will take the tray to her. After I examine it. 
QUARK: Er, is that really necessary? 
CARDASSIAN: Lift the lid. 
QUARK: If you insist. You see? Hasperat souffl�, just as I said. Stop poking it. It's very delicate. 
(The Cardassian leans in closer and continues spearing the food. Ziyal gives him a hypospray and he lands face down in it.) 
QUARK: Now you've ruined it. 
[Holding area]
(Kira and Leeta in one cell, Rom and Jake in the other. Jem'Hadar are standing guard.) 
ROM: How much longer before they detonate the minefield? 
KIRA: I wish you'd stop asking that. 
ROM: Sorry. 
JAKE: I'd say about ninety minutes. 
ROM: My time grows short. 
LEETA: Don't say that. 
ROM: The only reason they haven't killed me yet is that I'm part of their victory celebration. Seven o'clock, Dukat makes a speech. Eight thirty, cake and raktajino. Eight forty five, execute the Ferengi. 
(Quark enters brandishing disrupters. The Jem'Hadar spread out.) 
QUARK: All right, no one move! 
ROM: Brother! I knew you would come. 
QUARK: It's a surprise to me. Now, just keep calm and stay where you are. Understand? Don't move. You, open the holding cells. I said, open the holding cells. 
ZIYAL: You just told them not to move. 
QUARK: Right. Nobody moves except you. Now open the cells. 
(The Jem'Hadar look at each other then tense up. Quark kills them both in total surprise.) 
KIRA: Quark. 
QUARK: Yes? 
KIRA: Take down the forcefields. 
QUARK: Forcefields? 
(Ziyal takes a disrupter from Quark and blasts the control panel.) 
KIRA: I'd kiss you, Quark, but there isn't time. We have to find a way to shut down the power to the main computer. 
ROM: I can do that. 
LEETA: Oh, Rom. 
ROM: That is, if we can make it to the central computer core without being killed. 
KIRA: Right, Rom, you're with me. The rest of you, find someplace to stay out of sight. 
JAKE: Will do. 
(Quark is still stunned by what he did. Jake drags him out.) 
[Odo's quarters]
FOUNDER: I know you're confused, Odo, but you don't have to be. All the answers you seek are in the Link. 
(Doorbell.) 
ODO: Come in. 
WEYOUN: Forgive the intrusion, but Major Kira, the Ferengi saboteur and the rest of their terrorist group have escaped from the holding cells. For your own protection, I must ask you to come with me. 
FOUNDER: I want them caught. 
WEYOUN: They will be. But in the meantime, you'd both be safer in Ops. 
FOUNDER: Very well. Odo? 
ODO: I'll be fine here. 
FOUNDER: You're sure? 
ODO: Yes. 
[Corridor]
(It's a running battle with barrels providing convenient cover.) 
KIRA: Get out of here. 
[Cargo bay]
(Jem'Hadar come in through the other door. They hide behind crates.) 
ROM: Do you hear that? That's Bajoran phaser fire. 
KIRA: Why would Dominion troops be using Bajoran weapons? 
(There's a final thud, the firing stops and they look out to see dead Jem'Hadar and a live Bajoran security detail.) 
ODO: Never underestimate the element of surprise. 
[Corridor]
ODO: You have less than forty minutes to shut down the main computer. 
ROM: I hope that's enough time. 
KIRA: It'll have to be. Can you keep the Dominion patrols off our backs? 
ODO: I'll head down to Security, create enough false alarms to keep them occupied. Any questions? 
KIRA: I could ask why. 
ODO: I don't think there's time to explain it. Besides, I think you know the answer. 
(Rom heads off down a conduit. Kira starts to climb in too.) 
KIRA: What about the Link? 
ODO: The Link was paradise. But it appears I'm not ready for paradise. Good luck. 
KIRA: You too. 
[Bridge]
SISKO: Dax, what's our ETA? 
DAX: Eleven minutes. 
O'BRIEN: That's cutting it close. 
[Conduit junction]
KIRA: How's it going, Rom? 
ROM: I wish you'd stop asking that. 
KIRA: Sorry, sorry. 
ROM: I'm not going to make it. 
KIRA: All right then, concentrate on cutting off the power to the station's weapons array. Without weapons they won't be able to detonate the minefield. 
ROM: Not for a while anyway. 
[Ops]
DAMAR: Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. 
DUKAT: There's nothing to worry about. In exactly four minutes, thousands of Dominion ships will come pouring through that wormhole. I just hope the Defiant gets here in time for Sisko to see it. 
[Bridge]
DAX: Ben, if I were you, I'd start coming up with a plan B. 
[Conduit junction]
ROM: Almost there. I just need to decouple the ODN relays. 
[Ops]
DAMAR: The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. 
DUKAT: Fire. 
[Conduit]
ROM: Done. 
(The minefield begins to explode.) 
ROM: Uh-oh. 
KIRA: What is it? 
ROM: We were too late. 
[Bridge]
(On the viewscreen is DS9 with a background of flashes of light. Silence.) 
DAX: What do we do now, Captain? 
SISKO: Take us into the wormhole. 
O'BRIEN: What the hell. We're only going to meet a couple of thousand Dominion ships. 
DAX: One ship against an entire fleet? That's a hell of a plan B. 
GARAK: Chief, how does that poem end? 
O'BRIEN: You don't want to know. 
[Ops]
FOUNDER: Send a message to our listening posts in the Gamma Quadrant. Tell the reinforcements that the Alpha Quadrant awaits them. 
DAMAR: Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. 
WEYOUN: Destroy it. 
DUKAT: What's wrong, Damar? 
DAMAR: Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. 
WEYOUN: How can that be? 
DUKAT: Major Kira. 
(WHOOSH) 
[Bridge]
(Inside the wormhole.) 
SISKO: Full stop. Chief, divert all power to forward shields and weapons. 
DAX: Captain, I'm reading multiple warp signatures ahead. 
SISKO: On screen. Maximum magnification. 
(Here comes the enemy fleet, but no more than three abreast in the narrow tunnel.) 
SISKO: Lock phasers. Prepare to launch quantum torpedoes. 
[Limbo]
SISKO: Why have you brought me here? Show yourselves. What do you want? 
[Promenade]
ODO: The Sisko has returned to us. 
[Quark's]
JAKE: He arrives with questions. 
[Ops]
KIRA: There are always questions. 
SISKO: I didn't ask to come here. 
[Captain's office]
DUKAT: You desire to end the game. 
SISKO: What game? I don't understand. 
[Wardroom]
WEYOUN: You seek to shed your corporeal existence. 
[Bridge]
DAMAR: That cannot be allowed. 
[Promenade]
ODO: The game must not end. 
SISKO: The game? You mean my life? Is that what this is about? You don't want me to die? 
[Captain's office]
DUKAT: The game must continue. 
[Wardroom]
WEYOUN: You are the Sisko. 
SISKO: Believe me, I don't want to die, but I have to do everything I can to prevent the Dominion from conquering the Alpha Quadrant. If that means sacrificing my life and the life of my crew, so be it. 
[Quark's]
JAKE: We do not agree. 
KIRA: We find your reasoning flawed. 
ODO: Insufficient. 
SISKO: I'm flattered you feel that way, but it doesn't change anything. Now send me back to my ship. 
[Bridge]
SISKO: This isn't what I meant. I want to return to my reality. 
DAMAR: You are the Sisko. 
SISKO: I am also a Starfleet captain. I have a job to do and I intend to do it. 
WEYOUN: The Sisko is belligerent. 
DUKAT: Aggressive. 
DAMAR: Adversarial. 
SISKO: You're damn right I'm adversarial. You have no right to interfere with my life. 
[Ops]
KIRA: We have every right. 
SISKO: Fine. You want to interfere, then interfere. Do something about those Dominion reinforcements. 
ODO: That is a corporeal matter. 
DUKAT: Corporeal matters do not concern us. 
SISKO: The hell they don't. What about Bajor? You can't tell me Bajor doesn't concern you. You've sent the Bajorans orbs and Emissaries. You've even encouraged them to create an entire religion around you. You even told me once that you were of Bajor. So don't you tell me you're not concerned with corporeal matters. I don't want to see Bajor destroyed. Neither do you. But we all know that's exactly what's going to happen if the Dominion takes over the Alpha Quadrant. You say you don't want me to sacrifice my life? Well, fine, neither do I. You want to be gods, then be gods. I need a miracle. Bajor needs a miracle. Stop those ships. 
WEYOUN: We are of Bajor. 
DAMAR: But what of the Sisko? 
ODO: He is intrusive. 
DUKAT: He tries to control the game. 
JAKE: A penance must be exacted. 
WEYOUN: It is agreed. 
DUKAT: The Sisko is of Bajor, but he will find no rest there. 
KIRA: (touches Sisko's left ear) His pagh will follow another path. 
SISKO: What path is that? 
[Bridge]
(Back to reality.) 
O'BRIEN: Phaser banks fully charged. 
NOG: Forward shields at a hundred percent. 
O'BRIEN: Torpedoes ready. Targets locked. 
DAX: Here they come. 
SISKO: Fire on my command. 
NOG: There must be thousands of them. 
GARAK: And half of them have locked targets on us. 
SISKO: Steady, people. Make every shot count. 
DAX: Benjamin. 
(Energy crackles in the wormhole and the Dominion fleet vanishes.) 
O'BRIEN: They've cloaked. 
DAX: I'm not picking up any neutrino emissions. 
GARAK: Then where did they go? 
SISKO: Wherever they went, I don't think they're coming back. 
(The ultimate Deus ex Machina cop-out.) 
[Ops]
DAMAR: Sir, the wormhole is opening. 
(WHOOSH) 
DAMAR: The Defiant. 
DUKAT: Our reinforcements must be right behind. 
(The wormhole closes.) 
DAMAR: No, sir. There's no sign of them. 
WEYOUN: That's impossible. Check our listening posts in the Gamma Quadrant. 
DAMAR: They're not there either. 
DUKAT: But they entered the wormhole. Where are they? 
DAMAR: I don't know. 
(BOOM) 
DAMAR: The Defiant has opened fire on us. 
WEYOUN: Obviously. 
DUKAT: Can you get our weapons back online? 
DAMAR: Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. 
WEYOUN: Time to start packing. 
FOUNDER: Contact our forces in the Alpha Quadrant. Tell them to fall back to Cardassian territory. It appears this war is going to take longer than expected. 
WEYOUN: We'll meet you at airlock five. 
(The Founder and Weyoun leave. Dukat's jaw is still on the floor.) 
DAMAR: Sir? 
DUKAT: Victory was within our grasp. 
DAMAR: We have to evacuate the station, sir. 
DUKAT: Bajor, the Federation, the Alpha Quadrant, all lost. 
DAMAR: We have to go now, sir. 
DUKAT: Go? 
DAMAR: The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. 
DUKAT: I have to find my daughter. 
DAMAR: I'll send someone for her. 
DUKAT: That won't be necessary. 
DAMAR: You're wasting your time. 
DUKAT: Promenade. 
DAMAR: She won't go with you.

O'BRIEN: Sir, the Dominion forces are leaving the station. 
SISKO: Let them go. We're in no shape to stop them. 
BASHIR: Captain, we're getting a message from the Cortez. The Dominion fleet has broken off the fight. They're in retreat. 
SISKO: Tell the Cortez and the rest of our fleet to rendezvous at Deep Space Nine. 
[Promenade]
(Dukat stumbles along, searching for Ziyal.)

[Airlock]
COMPUTER: This is a first priority order. 
WEYOUN: Out of the way, out of the way. Step aside. Make way for the Founder. What about Odo? Is he coming with us? 
FOUNDER: No. But he will join us one day. It's only a matter of time. 
[Corridor]
ZIYAL: Father! 
DUKAT: Ah, Ziyal. 
ZIYAL: I've been looking for you. I heard about the evacuation. 
DUKAT: You're all I have, all I care about. 
ZIYAL: No matter how much I try to hate you, I can't. 
DUKAT: I couldn't live with myself if you hated me. Come, we'll talk on the way home. 
ZIYAL: Home? 
DUKAT: Cardassia. We have to leave here, Ziyal, before the Federation arrives. 
ZIYAL: I'm not leaving. 
DUKAT: These people are our enemies. 
ZIYAL: They're not my enemies. I'm one of them. 
DUKAT: That's not true. 
ZIYAL: Father, I helped Major Kira and the others escape from the holding cells. 
DUKAT: Do you know what you're saying? 
ZIYAL: Yes, I do. I belong here. Goodbye, Father. I love you. 
(Ziyal is shot.) 
DUKAT: No! 
DAMAR: You heard her. She's a traitor. 
(Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) 
DUKAT: Ziyal, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Ziyal, I forgive you. It's all right. 
DAMAR: We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. 
(Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) 
DUKAT: Ziyal, please hear me. I love you. I love you, Ziyal. 
(Ziyal dies.) 
DUKAT: No! No! Ziyal. 
[Promenade]
(A cheering crowd greets the returning heroes at the airlock.) 
SISKO: Jake-o. 
ODO: Welcome back, Captain. 
SISKO: Good to see you, Constable. It's good to see you all. 
MARTOK: Captain, it would appear I owe you a barrel of bloodwine. 
SISKO: We'll drink it together. 
DAX: Worf! 
WORF: Jadzia. 
DAX: I guess the wedding's still on. 
O'BRIEN: Quark, are the holosuites still working? 
QUARK: Ready and waiting, Chief. 
O'BRIEN: Julian, did you hear that? 
BASHIR: The Battle of Britain. I'll meet you there in an hour. 
ROM: You've been promoted? 
NOG: I'm an engineer. 
ROM: We'll be working together. 
NOG: Actually, you'll be working for me. 
(Garak is looking for someone.) 
JAKE: I really missed you. It's good to have you back, Dad. 
SISKO: So, where's Major Kira? 
JAKE: She's in the Infirmary, with Ziyal. 
[Infirmary]
KIRA: She loved you. 
GARAK: I could never figure out why. I guess I never will. 
[Holding area]
DUKAT: We'll go back to Cardassia, Ziyal. We'll be safe there. You'll live with me. Everything will be fine. 
SISKO: Maybe Doctor Bashir can do something for him. 
DUKAT: We'll both be very happy together. I know you forgive me. After all, I am your father and I forgive you. 
(Odo enters the cell.) 
DUKAT: My precious girl. 
ODO: Easy. Easy now. 
(Odo helps Dukat out of the cell.) 
DUKAT: I forgive you, too. 
(Dukat gives Sisko his baseball back.)
