[San Francisco - Bay Stadium]
(A shuttlepod lands in front of a huge crowd, and Archer with his senior staff are greeted as heroes.) 
FORREST: Well done, Jonathan. 
ARCHER: Thank you, Admiral. 
(the applause dies down, and Archer steps to the rostrum) 
ARCHER: I've been told that people are calling us heroes. When it comes to my crew, you won't get any argument from me. But I think it's important that we remember the heroes who aren't with us. the twenty seven crewmen who didn't make it back. Without their sacrifice, I wouldn't be standing here right now. None of us would. But I'm sure I speak on behalf of my entire crew when I say it's good to be home. 
[Club]
(Archer strolls in, in civvies.) 
ERIKA: Excuse me. 
ARCHER: Scotch.
ERIKA: The bar's reserved for regular customers. Galactic heroes have to sit at a table. 
ARCHER: I heard about your promotion. Congratulations, Captain. 
ERIKA: Thank you. 
ARCHER: Cheers. 
ERIKA: Cheers. So what was it like in the Expanse? 
ARCHER: You'll be at the debriefing tomorrow, won't you? I wouldn't want to spoil any surprises. Besides, I've got more important questions. Seen any good movies while I was gone? 
ERIKA: Another World War III epic. It swept all the awards. But you haven't missed much. Earth's been holding its breath for the past year, wondering if the Xindi were going to come back and finish the job. On the bright side, there've been more weddings and births than ever before. 
ARCHER: I don't see a ring. 
ERIKA: I'm married to Starfleet. Just like you. 
[T'Pol's quarters]
(The door chimes.) 
T'POL: Come in. 
TUCKER: Well, it looks like you're taking enough clothes to last a year. 
T'POL: You wanted something?;
TUCKER: I told the Captain I wanted to stay aboard and supervise the refit, but he suggested I take a break. More like an order, actually. Problem is, I'm not sure where to go. Lizzie's gone, my home town doesn't exist anymore. Guess this is my home now. 
T'POL: You could come with me. 
TUCKER: To Vulcan? 
T'POL: The transport leaves at eleven hundred hours. 
TUCKER: Where would I stay? 
T'POL: There's a guest room in my mother's home. 
TUCKER: Oh, your mom's house, huh? What does she know about me? About us? 
T'POL: I've never mentioned you. 
TUCKER: So you'd introduce me as? 
T'POL: Commander Charles Tucker the third. You've told the Captain that you don't get to see as many alien cultures as you'd like. You've never been to Vulcan. 
TUCKER: Eleven hundred hours, huh? I'd better start packing. 
[NX02 - Columbia - Bridge]
(She is still being fitted out in Spacedock.) 
ERIKA: We've tied these stations directly in the primary EPS junction. 
ARCHER: I hope you don't mind if I steal some of these improvements. 
ERIKA: I won't say anything if you do me a small favour. My senior officer candidates. I'd like to get your opinion. You've served with a few of them. 
(She hands over a data chip. 
Archer refers to the Captain's chair.) 
ARCHER: You might want to talk to someone about installing a lumbar support. You're going to spend a lot of hours in that chair. 
ERIKA: We've improved hull polarisation by twelve percent. We'll be able to hang in a firefight a little longer. 
ARCHER: Ventral and dorsal torpedo launchers, pulsed phase cannons. 
ERIKA: Upgrades you recommended. What is it? 
ARCHER: I had an argument once with Captain Jefferies. He was one of the designers of the NX-Class. 
ERIKA: I'm aware of that. 
ARCHER: I told him I didn't want to be in command of a warship trying to make first contact with new species. Jefferies was right. We needed those weapons, and a hell of a lot more. 
[Starfleet HQ]
(The debriefing session.) 
ARCHER: The asteroids were loaded with trellium ore. We think the Vulcans entered the field in order to mine it. 
WILLIAMS: Trellium? 
ARCHER: It's an alloy that protects against spatial anomalies. Ships in the Expanse used it to insulate their hulls. 
WILLIAMS: Your log reflects that when you boarded the Seleya you found the crew in a delusional, violent state. 
ARCHER: They attacked us the minute we docked. The trellium had a toxic effect on the Vulcans. It damaged their neural pathways. They lost the ability to suppress their emotions. 
SOVAL: According to your log, the entire crew of the Seleya was killed when you triggered a reactor breach. 
ARCHER: The breach was an accident. We were trying to disable their power grid. 
SOVAL: As far as I can determine, you didn't try to save a single Vulcan crewman. 
ARCHER: There was no point. They were too far gone. 
SOVAL: Is that your medical opinion, Captain? 
ARCHER: Phlox made that determination. 
SOVAL: Our specialists have examined the data you sent back. It's far from certain that the neurological damage was irreversible. 
ARCHER: There was nothing we could do for them. 
SOVAL: T'Pol was exposed to the trellium. She recovered. 
ARCHER: I couldn't help them! 
SOVAL: There's no need to get emotional, Captain. You spent several hours in the ship's auxiliary control room. In that time, did you try to access the internal sensors, or download the computer database? 
ARCHER: No. 
SOVAL: So in effect, we don't know what really happened aboard the Seleya. 
ARCHER: What the hell does that mean? 
SOVAL: Because of this oversight, we'll never have a complete picture of the events that led to the ship's destruction. 
ARCHER: I just told you exactly what led to the ship's destruction. 
FORREST: Captain. 
ARCHER: I'm not going to sit here and be accused of murdering those people. 
SOVAL: No one is accusing you of anything, Captain. 
ARCHER: Maybe that crew would still be alive if you'd been a little more helpful. 
SOVAL: I beg your pardon? 
ARCHER: You did everything you could to sabotage our mission. I got more help from the Andorians than I ever got from the High Command. 
FORREST: That's enough, Captain. 
ARCHER: This planet would be a cloud of dust right now if we'd listened to you. 
FORREST: That's enough! 
[Forrest's office]
ARCHER: How can you be taking his side? 
FORREST: I am not taking anyone's side. You were out of line. 
ARCHER: They don't lift a finger to help us and now I have to justify myself to that son of a bitch? 
FORREST: The debriefing's on hold, indefinitely. I want you to take some time off to clear your head. 
ARCHER: With all due respect, Admiral, I don't need a vacation. 
FORREST: That's an order, Captain! 
[Corridor]
(Phlox is overloaded with dufflebags and animal carry-boxes.) 
PHLOX: Lieutenant. If you wouldn't mind. 
(Reed takes some off him.) 
REED: Not exactly travelling light, are you? 
PHLOX: Thank you. Why leave the comforts of home, when you can take it all with you? 
REED: Okay. I trust you'll be taking the proper precautions on the surface. 
PHLOX: What do you mean? 
REED: I'm surprised you haven't heard. An Andorian and two Rigelians were attacked. 
PHLOX: Attacked? Why? 
REED: Apparently the Xindi incident has caused a degree of xenophobia. It's hard to believe in this day and age. I'm told the Vulcans are staying behind the walls of their compound. 
PHLOX: Well, I'm not going to let a few isolated incidents disrupt my vacation plans. I lived on Earth for many years before coming aboard Enterprise. 
REED: I don't think this is the same planet you remember, Doctor. People are looking for someone to blame and they don't care who it is. 
PHLOX: I appreciate your concern, but I'll be fine. Would you? 
(Reed opens the airlock for him.) 
PHLOX: Thank you. 
[By a tranquil lake]
(Archer is checking a length of rope.) 
ARCHER: Mind if I ask what you're doing here? 
ERIKA: You know better than to go climbing without a partner. 
[Vulcan - T'Pol's family home]
(The sky is red, and so is the rock as T'Pol opens the door and they go into a courtyard with oriental overtones including a gnarled small tree and a water feature of a giant urn with trickling water.) 
TUCKER: What about that volcano we saw on the way down, Mount Tar'ana? 
T'POL: Tar'hana. 
TUCKER: It still active? 
T'POL: There are frequent eruptions. We can schedule a tour of the crater, if you're interested. 
TUCKER: Volcanoes, ancient ruins, fire plains. I'm not sure where to start. So, this is where you grew up. It's not like I imagined. 
T'POL: Meaning? 
TUCKER: Well, it's beautiful. 
T'POL: Vulcans appreciate beauty. 
TUCKER: Well, I had no doubt about that. You always were a snazzy dresser. 
T'POL: Commander Tucker, I suggest 
T'LES: You didn't tell me you were bringing a guest. 
T'POL: Mother, you're home. 
T'LES: Obviously. It's agreeable to see you. You appear well. 
TUCKER: I'm Charles Tucker. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. 
(He manages the v-salute, and she responds.) 
T'LES: (to T'Pol, in Vulcan) Why is he here? 
T'POL: (in Vulcan) Commander Tucker is my colleague. He wanted to visit Vulcan. 
T'LES: (in Vulcan) This is the first time you've brought a colleague home with you. 
T'LES: You both must be very tired after your journey. 
(she leads the way into the living room) 
T'LES: The guest room is on the south end of the house. 
(Tucker leaves them.) 
T'POL: It's not yet midday. Why aren't you at the Science Academy? 
T'LES: I'm no longer an instructor there. I wrote you a letter. Didn't Starfleet transmit it to your ship? 
T'POL: We had communication difficulties in the Expanse. 
T'LES: I don't know why you're surprised. This was planned years ago. There's more to life than one's profession. Perhaps you'll learn that one day. It seems that I'm not the only one who knew you were coming. You received this yesterday. 
(She hands over a letter.) 
T'POL: It's from Koss. 
T'LES: Did you believe he had forgotten you? You're going to respond. 
T'POL: I have nothing to say to Koss. 
T'LES: He's your fianc�. 
T'POL: Former fianc�. 
T'LES: That is a matter for debate. It would be wise for you to speak with him. 
[Climbing a rock face]
ERIKA: You probably don't want to hear this, but I got a call from my brother yesterday. They renamed my old high school after you. How many is that, two, three dozen? 
ARCHER: I'm not counting. 
ERIKA: That's just North America. I don't think Zefram Cochrane has that many schools named after him. 
(Further on -) 
ERIKA: So, did you get a chance to look 'em over? 
ARCHER: Look what over? 
ERIKA: My senior officer candidates. Any suggestions for Tactical? 
ARCHER: You may want to find someone with more field experience, a MACO. 
ERIKA: I'm not sure how I feel about a military officer on the Bridge. 
ARCHER: If I were you, I'd talk to General Casey about assigning an entire squad. 
(going up a sheer face, using pitons and ropes) 
ARCHER: Things have changed since Enterprise left Spacedock. You'll spend a lot of your time boldly going into battle. 
ERIKA: Don't you think you're being a little cynical? 
ARCHER: Did you read my reports? 
ERIKA: Yes, Captain, I did. 
(She spots a pad mark.) 
ERIKA: Hey. 
(Archer scans it.) 
ARCHER: Mountain lion. Tracks are a few days old. 
ERIKA: Good thing I have you to protect me. 
[T'Pol's family home - guest room]
(It's still dark when T'Les strikes the gong in the courtyard, and someone knocks at his door.) 
TUCKER: Come in. 
T'POL: Good morning. 
TUCKER: What time is it? 
T'POL: Oh four hundred. 
TUCKER: You're kidding. 
T'POL: We have to prepare the morning meal. As guests, it's expected of us. 
[T'Pol's family home - living room]
(The sun is now up, and the three are settling down to the meal, mostly fruit by the looks of it.) 
T'POL: The nar'ru vines have bloomed early this year. 
T'LES: I've had ample time to attend to them. 
T'POL: It sounds as if you're not enjoying retirement. 
T'LES: You still haven't told me the reason for your visit. 
T'POL: I didn't know one was necessary. 
T'LES: I thought perhaps you'd decided to rejoin the High Command. 
I've been offered a commission with Starfleet. If I accept, it could be several years before I'm able to return home. 
T'LES: The gespar isn't fresh. My stasis unit needs to be replaced. 
TUCKER: Well, I'd be happy to take a look at it. If I can recalibrate a warp reactor, I ought to be able to handle a kitchen appliance. 
T'LES: My daughter's always been fascinated by alien worlds. She was all too eager to finish her schooling and leave Vulcan. 
T'POL: As I recall, you encouraged me to leave. 
T'LES: A mother is expected to push her young out of the nest. At some point, they're supposed to return. I'm told that on Earth a human child chooses their own path in life. They put their own wishes ahead of their family's. 
TUCKER: That's true for the most part. 
T'LES: You've learned much from them, haven't you? 
T'POL: A Starfleet posting is no less important than one with the High Command. I'm sure Father would have approved. 
T'LES: Your father believed that our work should enrich Vulcan society. 
T'POL: Earth is supposed to be our ally. 
T'LES: What's happened to you? 
T'POL: We shouldn't argue in front of a guest. 
[Bar]
(Reed signs an autograph for two young women.) 
REED: Well, thank you, that's very kind of you to say. Unfortunately, we can't actually give tours of the ship. If that policy ever changes, you two will be the first to know. 
TRAVIS: You had to wear that jacket. 
REED: Do you think I wore this jacket to attract attention? 
(It does have the Enterprise patch on the sleeve.) 
MAN: How's your drink? 
PHLOX: Delicious, thank you. 
MAN: Because I'd heard someplace your people didn't like alcohol. 
PHLOX: You may be thinking of Vulcans. 
MAN: You know, you're right. I get your species mixed up all the time. 
REED: Is there something we can help you with? 
MAN: I'm just trying to make sure your friend here is comfortable. Sitting in a bar full of so many strange looking aliens like us. 
PHLOX: I'm quite comfortable. 
MAN: Because if you weren't, if humans make you nervous for some reason, the Vulcan Consulate's on the other side of the bridge. I'll bet there's someplace there where someone like yourself could get a nice, refreshing beverage. 
PHLOX:: Well, perhaps we should be on our way? 
REED: We're not going anywhere, Doctor. 
MAN: If your friend wants to go, you should let him go. 
TRAVIS: You're not chasing anyone out of here. 
MAN: You Starfleet people are the real problem. You fly all around space telling every species you meet where to find Earth. Did it ever occur to you that might not be the smartest thing to do? 
REED: Sir, Why don't you just go back to the bar? 
MAN: Excuse me, Admiral. I don't take orders from you. 
TRAVIS: You heard him. Step away from the table. 
(The man tries to take a swing at Reed, but misses by a mile. A bar brawl instantly ensues.) 
PHLOX: Gentlemen, please! 
(The man is about to hit Phlox, when the Denobulan hold his breath and his face enlarges, with a frill around it. The combatants stare, amazed, then they run for it.) 
REED: Doctor? 
[T'Pol's family home - living room]
(We see that the kitchen is part of the main area, as T'Les comes in. Trip is fixing her stasis unit.) 
TUCKER: I just want to thank you for letting me stay here. 
T'LES: Expressing gratitude is an Earth custom. 
TUCKER: T'Pol says thank you all the time. 
(T'Les washes the vegetables she's brought.) 
T'LES: I've noticed. 
TUCKER: T'Pol's lucky. It's nice to have a place to go home to. 
T'LES: I know that you are romantically involved with my daughter. There's no logic in denying it. How long have you been attracted to her? 
TUCKER: I knew we had some kind of chemistry the first time we got into an argument. I never had fun arguing with anyone before. I got the impression T'Pol wasn't going to say anything to you. 
T'LES: She didn't. I'm her mother. You've repaired it? 
TUCKER: The field generator just needed a little adjustment. As good as new. 
T'LES: If you have the time, perhaps you could repair my food synthesiser. 
(There's a knock at the door.) 
T'LES: Would you mind? 
(Tucker opens the door to a male Vulcan.) 
T'LES: Koss? 
KOSS: I need to speak with T'Pol. 
[T'Pol's family home - courtyard]
KOSS: I want to hear about your life aboard the human ship. You must have many fascinating stories. 
T'POL: Why are you here? 
KOSS: The answer should be obvious. 
T'POL: You've received my letters. You know I'm not interested in marriage. 
KOSS: The decision isn't ours alone. My parents believe in the old traditions. For them, a betrothal cannot simply be dismissed. 
T'POL: You have the option of choosing another mate. 
KOSS: I don't want another mate. 
T'POL: You should be aware I've been ill recently. 
KOSS: Ill? 
T'POL: It could take some time for me to recover, assuming it's even possible. 
KOSS: I can help. My father's a man of influence. I knows the finest doctors in the province. I intend to go through with this. 
T'POL: What if I declare the kal-if-fee? 
KOSS: Is that what you want? A fight to the death? Perhaps your human friend would make a suitable challenger. 
T'POL: You find this amusing. 
KOSS: No. Call a challenger if you wish. I'll do whatever's necessary. 
T'POL: It's best if you leave. 
KOSS: I may be able to help your mother. 
T'POL: What do you mean? 
KOSS: My father could have her reinstated. 
T'POL: She retired. 
KOSS: She was asked to resign. 
T'POL: Why? 
KOSS: I've said more than I should. If we were to marry, you'd only have to live on Vulcan for one year. You could resume your career with Starfleet after that. 
T'POL: Is that what you want, an absent wife? 
KOSS: I'd want you to be happy. 
T'POL: You should go. 
[Sunset in the mountains]
ARCHER: How about that? 
ERIKA: What? 
ARCHER: Just to the left of Polaris. We found our first M-class planet around that star. 
ERIKA: Maybe humans will go back someday, build a colony? 
ARCHER: I doubt it. The air was filled with a psychotropic compound. After breathing it for a few hours, my senior officers nearly killed each other. Maybe the Vulcans were right. Maybe we weren't ready. 
ERIKA: Not ready? How long were we supposed to wait? 
ARCHER: Look what it's gotten us. We almost lost Earth. 
ERIKA: Enterprise saved Earth. 
ARCHER: If we weren't out there stirring up trouble, seven million people might still be alive. 
ERIKA: You weren't stirring up trouble. You were exploring. 
ARCHER: I'm not sure there's much of a difference. 
ERIKA: So what do you suggest? Put our starships in mothballs? 
ARCHER: No, we need them. But look at the Vulcans. They're not explorers. They keep their ships close to home. You never know who's going to come calling. 
ERIKA: That's not the mission either one of us signed up for. 
ARCHER: Well, maybe you'll feel differently after you've delivered a few dozen eulogies. 
[T'Pol's family home - living room]
T'LES: It's difficult to meditate with you standing there. 
T'POL: This retirement wasn't your choice. 
T'LES: That's not entirely accurate. I chose to retire rather than face dismissal. I was under investigation by the Security Ministry. They claimed I had taken restricted data from the Academy archives. 
T'POL: Did you? 
T'LES: No. 
T'POL: I don't understand. 
T'LES: Their accusations were fabricated. I was told that if I left the Academy they would end the inquiry. 
T'POL: Why would the Ministry do this? Because of me. They blamed me for the incident at P'Jem. 
T'LES: After the monastery was destroyed, the First Minister was dismissed. You've made many enemies here. 
T'POL: They couldn't reach me on Enterprise, so they punished you. It's criminal. How could you let them do this? 
T'LES: You've changed. Your emotions were always close to the surface, but you managed to suppress them. It's because of this Commander Tucker, isn't it? He's the reason why you refuse to bond with Koss. Do you really believe that a human and a Vulcan can have a future together? Imagine the shame your children would endure, assuming that the two of you could have children. 
T'POL: That wouldn't be your concern. 
[Night in the mountains]
(The pair are in their sleeping bags, but Archer can't sleep. The nocturnal noises prompt him to get a phase pistol from his rucksack and go scouting. He is jumped by a pair of Xindi reptilians who throw him off a cliff, and he wakes up screaming.) 
ERIKA: You all right? 
ARCHER: I'm not even sure what all right means anymore. 
ERIKA: Want to talk about it? There's an old code among climbers. Anything that happens on the mountain stays there. 
ARCHER: You want to know why I'm out here? I figured this is the last place I'd run into anyone who'd want to shake my hand or take my picture or tell me I'm an inspiration to their children. If they knew what I'd done. 
ERIKA: You did what any captain would have done. 
ARCHER: Does that include torture? Or marooning a ship full of innocent people? Because I don't remember reading those chapters in the handbook. 
ERIKA: Where are you going, Jon? Are you going to go climbing in the middle of the night? 
ARCHER: Why not? 
ERIKA: It'd be a shame if you lost your footing. It's a long way down. But at least you wouldn't have to deal with these feelings anymore. 
ARCHER: Are you telling me I have some kind of a death wish? 
ERIKA: You tell me. 
All I'm trying to do is get away from you. I look at you, and I see the person I was three years ago. The explorer that my father wanted me to be. I lost something out there, and I don't know how to get it back. 
(Erika leans over and kisses him, long and gentle.) 
ARCHER: What was that? 
ERIKA: Something I haven't done in a while. Whatever you lost, maybe I could help you find it. 
[Vulcan]
(T'Pol takes Tucker sightseeing to a place with lots of giant statues.) 
TUCKER: You know, if we have time when we get back to Earth, I'd like to show you some sights, return the favour. Everything okay? 
T'POL: There's something I need to tell you. I've decided to marry Koss. 
TUCKER: Marry him? 
T'POL: If I join his family, my mother will regain her position at the Academy. His father is a senior Minister with a great deal of influence. 
TUCKER: I don't get it. Are they forcing you to do this? 
T'POL: The decision was mine. My mother resigned because of my actions. 
TUCKER: You told me three years ago you didn't even love this guy. So you're just going to leave Starfleet, move back to Vulcan? 
T'POL: I've been negotiating with Koss's family. 
TUCKER: Negotiating? 
T'POL: They've agreed we won't have to reside together, not right away. I'll remain on Enterprise for the time being. 
TUCKER: That's real generous of them. 
T'POL: Trip, I have to do this for many reasons. 
TUCKER: And how am I supposed to take this? 
T'POL: I'm sorry. 
TUCKER: You're sorry. You brought me sixteen light years just to watch you get married to someone you barely know. 
[Daytime in the mountains]
ERIKA: We should have brought a camera. 
ARCHER: You remember that planet I told you about? There was a mountain range on the southern continent. The view was almost as amazing as this. 
ERIKA: That's a good day's climb we've got ahead of us. We can reach the summit by nightfall, but we should get moving. 
ARCHER: I think the view is fine from here. I'm glad you tagged along. 
ERIKA: You know, there's still something I'm not quite clear about. 
ARCHER: What's that? 
ERIKA: Why did we stop seeing each other? 
ARCHER: Well, I was your superior officer. It wasn't appropriate. 
ERIKA: You're not my superior anymore. (they kiss) I wonder if Starfleet would approve? The captains of the only two warp five ships? 
ARCHER: You're forgetting the climber's code. 
[Sickbay]
(In Spacedock, the external repairs to Enterprise are almost complete.) 
HOSHI: So, what's the verdict? Am I going to live? 
PHLOX: Your parasite count is almost negligible. This should dispose of the rest of them. 
HOSHI: I hope you're going to make it tonight. 
PHLOX: Hmm? 
HOSHI: Madame Chang's. Don't tell me that you forgot. 
PHLOX: My osmotic eel is under the weather. I should stay aboard until she's feeling better. 
HOSHI: Wait. No, you've been talking about the egg-drop soup at this place for as long as I've known you. 
PHLOX: I'm sure you and Ensign Mayweather will enjoy it. 
HOSHI: I spoke with Travis. What happened to you the other night? 
PHLOX: Oh, you must mean the, er ((holding breath gesture). Nothing more than an instinctive defensive response. 
HOSHI: So you're going to stay aboard the ship because of some loudmouth in a bar? 
PHLOX: My presence could provoke another incident. Someone could get hurt. 
HOSHI: This isn't the way to deal with prejudice. The best thing is to show your face and remind people that there are aliens who don't want to blow up the planet. 
PHLOX: I can't blame those men for the way they reacted. Earth has survived a horrific attack. It will take time for the trauma to heal. Besides, I have friends to keep me company. Now, if it's not too much trouble? 
HOSHI: I'll bring you some take-out. 
[Starfleet HQ]
WILLIAMS: The details of this debriefing will remain classified, as ordered by the Command Council. 
FORREST: If there are no further questions? 
(Everyone rises and leaves the room, except Archer and Soval.) 
ARCHER: Ambassador. I want to apologise for what I said to you the other day. I was out of line. 
SOVAL: Yes, you were. 
ARCHER: I'm glad we can finally agree on something. 
SOVAL: Captain. Your actions, while being morally questionable, were necessary. I opposed your appointment as captain of Enterprise, but it's obvious now that I was wrong. T'Pol has told me that the Expanse would have someday encompassed hundreds of systems, including Vulcan. You've done a great service for both our worlds. 
(He holds out his hand.) 
SOVAL: Thank you.
(They shake.) 
[T'Pol's family home -;guest room]
TUCKER: Come in. 
T'LES: Koss and his family are waiting. 
TUCKER: I'll be there as soon as I can. Know any good tailors? 
(T'Les does up his collar for him.) 
T'LES: These clothes belonged to my husband. They fit you well. 
TUCKER: Aren't you bothered by the fact that T'Pol doesn't even care for this guy? 
T'LES: She's fulfilling her family obligation. I met my husband only once before we were joined. In time, we developed a deep connection to each other. 
T'POL: Yeah. Well, maybe she'd rather make a connection with someone else. 
T'LES: Have you informed T'Pol? 
TUCKER: Informed her of what? 
T'LES: You're in love with her. Vulcans may not express their emotions, but we are sensitive to them. 
TUCKER: I don't think I knew it until we were standing over that lava field and she told me she was going to marry Koss. That's when it hit me. I was going to lose her. I wanted to tell her right there, but I couldn't. 
T'LES: There's still time. 
TUCKER: I thought you didn't approve. 
T'LES: I may not condone your relationship, but it's important for her to have all the facts. 
TUCKER: If I say anything, T'Pol might call off the wedding. Or worse, not call it off. She's got enough pressure on her as it is. I don't want to make things any more complicated. 
[T'Pol's family home -; living room]
(Koss is striking the gong to summon everyone.)
