In A Mirror, Darkly - part 1
Original Airdate: 22 Apr, 2005
[Bozeman, Montana. April 5, 2063]
(A bunch of ragged humans watch a sleek alien ship land at their rough and ready camp. It's the movie 'First Contact', basically, as Zephram Cochrane comes forward to meet their Vulcan visitors) 
VULCAN: Live long and prosper. 
(Zephram tries to mimic his salute, then (in close up) we see his hand go into his coat and pull out a big gun with which he shoots the Vulcan dead. This is a cue for the rest of the group.) 
MAN: Board that ship! Take everything you can! 
(And they do, leading us into opening credits with unfamiliar music, that start the same and then become very different with images of conflict instead of exploration, and a final logo of Earth with a sword through it. Anyone else old enough to recognise it?) 
Captain's Starlog, January 13, 2155. We've left Gorlan Station and have set a course to rendezvous with our assault fleet. Major Reed and the doctor have asked for a few minutes to show me their latest project. 
[Agony Booth]
(A Tellarite in a Starfleet uniform is suffering.) 
REED: (in MACO uniform) The Booth will be far more effective than our previous disciplinary methods. 
PHLOX: It can stimulate the pain centre of virtually any humanoid. A synaptic scan calibrates it for each species. 
ARCHER: They call this progress. 
FORREST: There's something to be said for a good, old-fashioned flogging. 
REED: Well, that's what's so exceptional about this device. Traditional forms of punishment can overwhelm the nervous system. After a time, the brain ceases to feel anything. 
PHLOX: These sensors continually shift the stimulation from one nerve cluster to another, keeping the subject in a constant state of agony. 
FORREST: I think you enjoy your work too much, Doctor. 
ARCHER: What exactly did Mister Terev do? 
REED: I'm not certain. I suspect he was late for his duty shift. Aren't all Tellarites guilty of something? 
(Forrest leaves, and Archer scurries after him.) 
[Corridor]
ARCHER: Did you get a chance to look over my proposal? 
FORREST: I read it. 
ARCHER: And? 
FORREST: We're going to rendezvous with the fleet as ordered. I'm not going into Tholian space based on data from some anonymous source. Maybe you haven't heard, but we have a rebellion to put down. The Tholians aren't part of it. 
ARCHER: You saw the data. This technology would give us a tactical advantage. We could end the war tomorrow. 
FORREST: You see this as your big chance, don't you? 
ARCHER: Sir? 
FORREST: You bring that ship home, and you'll be a hero. The Emperor pins a medal on your chest. You might even get that command you've always wanted. 
ARCHER: My only concern is saving the Empire. 
FORREST: Resume your station. 
ARCHER: Captain, you're making a mistake. 
FORREST: You can either go back to the Bridge or take the place of that Tellarite. Which do you prefer? 
ARCHER: Understood. 
[Forrest's quarters]
(They seem somewhat larger than we're used to.) 
HOSHI: (in flimsy black negligee) What do you think you're doing? 
FORREST: Reviewing status reports. 
HOSHI: This is supposed to be your sanctuary. A place to get away from status reports. 
(She turns off the monitor and kisses him.) 
FORREST: You're the one person on this ship that I don't mind giving in to. 
HOSHI: And probably the only one who doesn't want to slip a knife in your back. I heard the battle went well at Tau Ceti. 
FORREST: Is that what you heard? 
HOSHI: Word on the ship is the war may be over soon. I'll go back to Brazil, start teaching again. You'll accept a comfortable desk job at Headquarters. We'll have the weekends. 
FORREST: You've been listening to propaganda. Things went badly at Tau Ceti. Very badly. We lost twelve ships. Keep this to yourself. If the crew learns what really happened 
HOSHI: Forget about the war. This is our time. 
[Outside Turbolift]
(Forrest's bodyguard opens the door to reveal Reed and a female MACO. The Bodyguard is shot, Forrest reaches for his weapon but Archer and MACO Travis (complete with earring) comes from behind and take it off him.) 
ARCHER: Don't! 
FORREST: You'll hang for this. 
ARCHER: Lock him in the Brig. 
REED: Sir, let me take him down to the Cargo bay. I'll finish him quickly, quietly. 
ARCHER: I want him alive. 
REED: Still, it'd be tragic if there was an accident on the way to the Brig. 
(Archer slams Reed against the bulkhead.) 
ARCHER: If anything happens to Forrest, I'll shoot you myself. Are we clear, Major? 
REED: Perfectly, sir. 
[Bridge]
(T'Pol is slouched in the Captain's chair, naked midriff fully on display and hair down below her shoulders.) 
ARCHER: Stand aside, Commander. 
T'POL: Where's Captain Forrest? (to Tactical) Contact Security. 
(Travis shoots him.) 
ARCHER: This is First Officer Archer. In accordance with Starfleet orders this date 
[Forrest's quarters]
(Hoshi is lying in bed, reading.) 
ARCHER [OC]: I've relieved Captain Forrest of duty and assumed command of Enterprise. My orders are to 
[Sickbay]
(Phlox is doing a spot of recreational vivisection.) 
ARCHER [OC]: Take the ship into Tholian space for a mission of vital importance to the Empire. I can't reveal the details of our assignment, but I can tell you this. 
[Engineering]
(Tucker has similar scarring to Captain Pike in Menagerie.) 
ARCHER [OC]: If we're successful, Starfleet will crush the rebellion once and for all. 
[Bridge]
ARCHER: No crew in Starfleet has been tested more in battle. I know I can count on each of you to perform your duty to the best of your ability. Nothing will impede our march toward victory. Long live the Empire. 
CREW: Long live the Empire. 
T'POL: (in his ear) We've received no such communiqu�s from Starfleet Command. 
ARCHER: It was sent on a private channel. 
T'POL: I'd like to see those orders. 
ARCHER: All in good time. Alter our heading. Two one five mark thirteen. Maximum warp. 
HELM: Yes, Captain. 
ARCHER: (to the female MACO) Corporal, escort Commander T'Pol to Cargo bay two. You'll find a Suliban cloaking device there. Bring it to Engineering and help Tucker install it. We're going to need the cloak to complete this mission. 
Enterprise Starlog, Captain Jonathan Archer. The crew has accepted the change of command without incident. Chief Engineer Tucker reports we'll have cloaking capability within six hours. 
[Ready room]
(Where the pictures of various Enterprises used to hang, there are now racks of historic weaponry.) 
T'POL: These orders appear to be authentic. 
ARCHER: Appear? All I require from you is your loyalty. Do I have it? 
T'POL: You are in command. 
ARCHER: I'm glad we can agree on something. Do you recognise this? (holds up a gun) It belonged to Zefram Cochrane. He used it to kill the first Vulcan who stepped onto Terran soil. I wonder how history would have played out if Cochrane hadn't turned the tables on your invasion force. Humans might be your slaves instead of the other way around. 
T'POL: I'm not a slave. 
ARCHER: You're Vulcan. Never forget that. How long until we cross into Tholian space? 
T'POL: It's likely we already have. They frequently annex systems outside their core territory. 
ARCHER: There's a warp signature encoded on this. Notify me the moment you find it. 
T'POL: If there's nothing further. 
ARCHER: There is. I'm promoting you to First Officer. 
T'POL: Major Reed's next in line. He won't be pleased. 
ARCHER: Reed is a capable soldier, but he has trouble following orders. And I know he has ambitions of his own. 
T'POL: You've made it clear you don't approve of Vulcans. 
ARCHER: Maybe this is my way of saying thank you to you and your people. Without Vulcan technology, the Empire wouldn't be where it is today. Dismissed. 
[Archer's quarters]
ARCHER: Serving as my personal guard will have its privileges. You'll have your own quarters, better food. You'll accept orders from me and me alone, is that clear? 
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. And Captain, if I may? I'd like to be the first to congratulate you on a brilliant strategy. I'm certain that in years to come. 
ARCHER: You already have the job, Sergeant. Don't talk yourself out of it. (A Rottweiler growls) Don't mind Porthos. He hasn't had his dinner yet. (Doorbell chimes) Come in. 
(Hoshi is escorted in.) 
ARCHER: That'll be all. 
(Travis leaves.) 
HOSHI: You didn't receive a communiqu� from Starfleet. I would have known if something came through. A mutiny. Didn't think you had it in you. 
ARCHER: I'll take that as a compliment. 
HOSHI: Where's Captain Forrest? 
ARCHER: He's safe. 
HOSHI: How do I know that you didn't push him out of an airlock? 
(He shows her Forrest in the Brig, on his desk monitor.) 
HOSHI: I want to talk to him. 
ARCHER: Not right now. He'll remain alive as long as you don't cause any trouble. No hidden distress signals to Starfleet. I need you and your expertise. 
HOSHI: Is that all you need? You've never forgiven me for leaving. I'm sorry if I hurt you. 
ARCHER: You saw an opportunity for advancement, and you took it. 
HOSHI: Just as you did. You should've been Captain from the moment we left Spacedock. You've always known that. If it hadn't been for all those Admirals conspiring behind your back, Enterprise would have been yours. Tradition says that whatever belonged to the previous Captain is yours for the taking. 
ARCHER: I've never been one to argue with tradition. 
(They kiss, and she pulls a knife from the back of her bodice and he takes it off her, all the time with their lips glued together.) 
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer. 
ARCHER: Maybe we should keep our relationship on a professional level. 
T'POL [OC]: Captain Archer, please respond. 
ARCHER: Go ahead. 
T'POL [OC]: We're approaching the warp signature. 
ARCHER: On my way. I expect you to be in a better mood when I get back. 
[Bridge]
REED: Captain on the Bridge. 
T'POL: We're closing on target. Twenty thousand kilometres. 
REED: There's one biosign aboard. Tholian. 
ARCHER: Power the tractor emitters. 
REED: He's seen us. He's arming weapons. 
ARCHER: Disable his ship. I don't want the pilot injured. 
(A barrage of torpedoes hit the blue dart ship.) 
REED: Done. 
T'POL: There's an overload building in his reactor. 
ARCHER: Major! 
REED: It wasn't my doing, sir. I targeted his weapons only. 
T'POL: I believe the pilot may be attempting to destroy his own ship. 
ARCHER: Lock on the transporter. Beam him into the Decon Chamber. 
REED: Captain. 
(The Tholian ship explodes.)
T'POL: We have the pilot. 
ARCHER: Archer to Sickbay. We beamed a Tholian into Decon. 
[Sickbay]
ARCHER [OC]: Modify the atmosphere in there. 
(Phlox leaves his latest primate subject.) 
PHLOX: It may take a moment. Tholians have rather extreme life support requirements. Increasing temperature to four hundred and eighty Kelvin. 
(Noises come over the Decon intercom.) 
PHLOX: If you're angry now, just wait. 
[Outside Decon]
ARCHER: How is he? 
PHLOX: How is it would be more accurate. Tholians possess both male and female characteristics. Its biosigns, such as they are, appear to be stable. 
ARCHER: Will it understand me? 
(Hoshi nods, and Archer peers into the Decon Chamber. He sees nothing, then suddenly a very red hot alien jumps up into view, startling everyone.) 
ARCHER: I'm Captain Archer. You're on board the Terran flagship, Enterprise. Answer my questions, or you will be harmed. 
HOSHI: It's demanding to be released. 
ARCHER: I want to know where you're holding the Terran vessel you captured. 
HOSHI: My people will find your ship and destroy it. 
PHLOX: A minor adjustment to life support should make it more co-operative. Decreasing temperature fifty degrees. 
ARCHER: Tell me what I want to know. 
HOSHI: Something about your maternal ancestor. 
ARCHER: Take it down another fifty. 
PHLOX: Its exoskeleton is beginning to fracture. 
HOSHI: I agree. I agree. 
(Archer gestures for the temperature to go up again.) 
ARCHER: Go on. 
HOSHI: The ship is in the Vintaak system at a facility orbiting the gas giant. 
(A strange noise starts up.) 
ARCHER: What the hell is that? 
T'POL: A short-range transmission. 
REED: A distress signal. You think it has a comm. device in there? 
T'POL: Its crystalline structure may act as a natural transmitter. 
REED: Sir, I recommend we beam it into space immediately. 
ARCHER: No. I need to keep it alive for now, until I can verify what it's told us. Find some way to knock that thing out. 
PHLOX: Yes, Captain. 
[Engineering]
(Thick cables lead from the warp drive to the cloaking device.) 
TUCKER: You forget something? Biggs! Get the commander a radiation meter. You don't want to end up like me, do you? I've absorbed enough delta rays to guarantee my grandchildren glow in the dark. 
T'POL: Flux coupler. 
TUCKER: They say for every year you spend next to one of these things, you lose a decade off your life expectancy. Which means I'll probably be dead by the end of the week. 
T'POL: You should speak to Captain Archer about a promotion. 
TUCKER: Well, you're his First Officer. You could talk to him for me. 
T'POL: Why would I do that? 
TUCKER: I did you a favour once. 
T'POL: We agreed never to discuss that. 
TUCKER: And I haven't. 
T'POL: I'd hardly call it a favour. You enjoyed yourself. 
TUCKER: Several times, as I recall. So, how many years is it until your Pon farr comes around again? 
(A strange noise starts up.) 
TUCKER: Where the hell's that coming from? 
(An energy pulse goes along a cable to the cloak.) 
TUCKER: Pull the matrix converters! 
(Too late, it goes bang and throws him to the floor.; A short time later, (Phlox is treating Trip's injuries.) 
ARCHER: Can you repair the cloak? 
TUCKER: It'll take at least a day. 
ARCHER: You have six hours. 
REED: There are dozens of EPS feeds on this deck, and the only one that overloads is the one connected to the cloaking device. 
TUCKER: The power surge disabled other systems. Internal sensors are down, we've lost grav-plating on G deck. 
ARCHER: The cloak's your first priority. (to Reed) Someone's responsible for what happened. Find out who. 
TUCKER: My people can investigate this. I don't need his kind crawling around, pulling relays. 
ARCHER: Get the cloak online. 
[Brig]
ARCHER: Who sabotaged the cloak? 
FORREST: Was something damaged? 
ARCHER: I know Admiral Black has an agent on Enterprise. I want the name. 
FORREST: You really think that the Admiral would plant a spy on my ship and then tell me who it is? 
ARCHER: (to Travis) Go to his quarters, search his personal files. Look for messages from Starfleet. 
FORREST: Follow his orders, and you'll be executed as a co-conspirator. 
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain. 
(But to who,, we're not sure.)
(Travis leaves.) 
FORREST: This isn't like you, Jonathan. You never lusted for power and glory. That's why I trusted you at my side for all these years, because you have no ambition. 
(Archer opens the door and walks in, punches him in the kidneys and throws him against the walls.) 
ARCHER: If that's right, then why are you in the Brig? 
FORREST: (in a strangle hold) Release me and I promise your death will be quick. You won't get that guarantee from the Admiral. Kill me and she'll never forgive you. 
[Situation room]
REED: The saboteur entered this junction and deliberately overloaded this EPS waveguide. 
ARCHER: That junction's supposed to be off-limits. 
REED: The intruder alarms were disabled. 
ARCHER: How? 
REED: There's only one way I know of. By running a high-level diagnostic scan. Commander Tucker initiated a scan thirty minutes before the overload. 
[Agony booth]
ARCHER: Who ordered you to sabotage the cloak? 
TUCKER: I didn't! 
(Reed is at the controls and enjoying himself.) 
TUCKER: Reed, I'll kill you when I get out of this! 
REED: I'd like to see you try. 
ARCHER: I checked the records. Admiral Black recommended you for Chief Engineer. He insisted Forrest replace his own man with you. You're working for the Admiral, aren't you? What have you told him? 
TUCKER: Captain, you've got it all wrong. It wasn't me! 
ARCHER: What have you told him? 
TUCKER: Please, Captain. I've always been loyal to you! 
ARCHER: Break him. 
[Archer's quarters]
(Hoshi and Archer are in bed together.) 
HOSHI: It hasn't been that good in a long time. The things a girl will give up for her career. 
ARCHER: The data I gave you. Did you transmit it to the Fleet Admiral? 
HOSHI: Of course. What was it? 
ARCHER: Insurance policy. 
(He sits up.) 
HOSHI: What's wrong? 
ARCHER: Tucker's a competent engineer. If he wanted to damage the cloak, he could have done a much better job. 
HOSHI: Well, it couldn't have been easy with T'Pol looking over his shoulder. 
ARCHER: Computer, locate Commander T'Pol. 
COMPUTER: (male) Unable to comply. Internal sensors are offline. 
ARCHER: The sensors were damaged by the overload. 
HOSHI: What's going on? 
ARCHER: Stay here. 
[Brig]
(T'Pol and her Vulcan allies stage a jail break just as Archer gets there. There's a gunfight in the corridor, then Archer ducks into a turbolift.) 
FORREST: I wondered what was keeping you. 
T'POL: I needed time to find help. 
FORREST: No alarm? 
T'POL: I've disabled the internal sensors and the comm. system. 
FORREST: We'll take the Bridge first. 
[Bridge]
(They shoot the duty officer and the helm officer.) 
FORREST: Set a course out of Tholian space, maximum warp. 
T'POL: I can't alter our heading. 
FORREST: Full stop! 
T'POL: The helm's not responding. 
(The turbolift door opens, and Archer is there, empty-handed.) 
ARCHER: Having trouble? 
FORREST: You did this. 
ARCHER: Autonavigation can't be released until we've reach the coordinates I've set. 
FORREST: Restore the controls now. 
ARCHER: I can't. They've been encrypted with a random code. 
FORREST: Can you override the helm? 
T'POL: It'll take several days to break the encryption. 
ARCHER: We'll arrive at the co-ordinates long before then. (sarcastically) The Bridge is yours, Captain. 
[Agony booth]
PHLOX: Ten hours in the Booth. Impressive. 
FORREST: Get him out of there. 
(Archer falls out of the perspex tube.) 
FORREST: Bring Major Reed. I want him to spend some time in this invention of his. 
ARCHER: You going to shoot me now or wait for court-martial? 
FORREST: Fleet Admiral Gardner's ordered you released. He received the data you sent him. The Admiral finds your suggestion intriguing. Since you've already locked us on this course, I've been ordered to investigate your mystery ship. You betrayed me. Don't think for one moment I'm going to forget that. Get cleaned up. You're briefing the senior staff in an hour. 
[Conference room]
T'POL: A parallel universe? The Science Directorate has examined all of these theories. They've found no evidence of alternate realities. 
ARCHER: The Tholians are a little more open-minded than your people. They detonated a tricobalt warhead here, inside the gravity well of a dead star. The explosion created an interphasic rift. A doorway into another universe. 
TUCKER: A doorway. 
ARCHER: The rift was unstable. It was too dangerous to send one of their own ships through, so they transmitted a distress call into the opening, hoping to lure a ship from the other side. Their plan worked brilliantly. 
HOSHI: How did you learn all this? 
ARCHER: The Tholians rely on outside labourers. Humanoids. Some of them can be bought for the right price. 
TUCKER: I hope you didn't pay too much. 
ARCHER: My contact transmitted these images before his signal was jammed. 
TUCKER: You can barely see anything. 
ARCHER: Computer, enhance grid three alpha. 
(Just sticking out of the moon is the saucer section of NCC1764.) 
FORREST: An Earth ship? 
ARCHER: According to some theories, everything that exists in our universe should also exist there. 
HOSHI: Another Terran Empire? Another Starfleet? 
TUCKER: So what? How does this help us? 
ARCHER: The Tholians quantum-dated a piece of the hull. This ship is not only from another universe, it's from another time. About a hundred years into the future. Imagine the technology we can find on that ship. New tactical systems, advanced bio-weapons. Engines that can reach speeds we can only dream of. All of it ours for the taking! 
T'POL: This is ludicrous, Captain. Someone has fabricated this evidence to lure us here. Commander Archer is guilty of assault and mutiny. 
FORREST: That's enough, Commander. 
T'POL: Sir, I believe we should send 
FORREST: I said shut up! We're investigating this. Get that cloaking device working. 
[Engineering]
T'POL: The Captain wants a progress report. 
TUCKER: I'll need another minute to calibrate the field converters. I spent four hours in the Booth because of you. 
T'POL: Perhaps you should direct your anger at Commander Archer. 
TUCKER: You disabled the alarms in that junction and made it look like I did it. 
T'POL: You're mistaken. 
TUCKER: The hell I am! I think I'd remember if I had sabotaged the ship! 
T'POL: Not necessarily. 
TUCKER: What did you do to me? 
T'POL: I lured you away from Engineering with the promise of a sexual encounter. 
[T'Pol's quarters - memory]
T'POL: My mind to your mind. 
T'POL [OC]: Once we were alone in my quarters, I implanted a telepathic suggestion. 
T'POL: My thoughts to your thoughts. 
T'POL [OC]: I compelled you to sabotage the power grid. 
[Engineering]
T'POL: After you completed the assignment, we melded again. I altered your memory of what had happened. It was my duty to help Captain Forrest regain command. 
TUCKER: You're going to regret what you did. 
T'POL: Threats are illogical. 
TUCKER: Engineering to Bridge! 
FORREST [OC]: Go ahead. 
TUCKER: We're ready. 
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: I'm going to have to channel everything except auxiliary power. 
FORREST: Engage the cloak. 
(Enterprise shimmers out of sight and continues on its journey.) 
T'POL: We've reached the coordinates. Autonavigation has disengaged. 
FORREST: Let's see where we are. 
(It's an aqua-coloured gas giant with rings and moons.) 
ARCHER: Magnify the moon on the far right. 
(There's the ship from the briefing - TOS era design, USS Defiant.) 
[Situation room]
T'POL: Primary systems are offline, including life support. We're reading thirteen biosigns, all alien. One of them appears to be reptilian. They're clustered in this section. 
(She indicates the area where the nacelles join the lower decks.) 
ARCHER: Any sign of the crew? 
T'POL: We've detected no human signatures. 
REED: It's likely the crew was executed. 
TUCKER: Look at the size of those coils. I'll bet that thing could do warp seven. 
FORREST: We'll send an assault team aboard. You brought us here, you lead it. Download whatever you can from the database, then destroy the ship. 
ARCHER: Destroy it? We have to take the ship with us. 
FORREST: It's too dangerous. We are deep in Tholian space. 
ARCHER: Sir, you can't do this. 
FORREST: You have your orders! Dismissed. 
(Archer, Reed and Tucker leave.) 
FORREST: (to T'Pol) Go with him. I don't want Archer to return from this mission. Do I make myself clear, Commander? 
[USS Defiant]
(Five figures in EV suits beam aboard.) 
T'POL: Someone's removed these components. 
ARCHER: They're gutting the ship. 
(They come across a figure in a red shirt lying on a corridor floor.) 
T'POL: Human. 
(Archer rolls him over. Ensign Ricky has a big hole in his chest. Archer picks up his phaser.) 
REED: If you'd like, sir, I could hold that for you. 
(So Archer puts it in his belt.) 
[Decon Chamber]
(The Tholian has started making noises again.) 
PHLOX: Nap time isn't over yet. 
(But this time he can't stop the signal.) 
[Bridge]
HOSHI: I'm picking up a transmission. It's coming from Decon. 
FORREST: Bridge to Phlox. 
[Decon Chamber]
FORREST [OC]: What's happening down there? 
PHLOX: The sedative is no longer working. 
FORREST [OC]: Well then kill it, now! 
PHLOX: With pleasure. 
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Three ships are moving toward our position. 
FORREST: Doctor? 
[Decon chamber]
PHLOX: A few more seconds, Captain. Will you kindly die? 
(The six legged Tholian finally explodes.) 
PHLOX: Phlox to Bridge. 
[Bridge]
PHLOX [OC]: You won't be having any further trouble from our guest. 
HOSHI: One of the Tholian ships is hailing us. 
[USS Defiant - Bridge]
ARCHER: This must be the Captain. 
T'POL: His neck's broken. 
TUCKER: (at the science station) We should be able to overload the reactor from here. 
ARCHER: Get started. 
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Four more ships. 
FORREST: Contact Archer. Tell him to abort the mission. Lay in a course out of here. 
HOSHI: They're jamming us. 
(The Tholian ships start to create their web around Enterprise.) 
FORREST: Target the nearest ship. Fire! 
HOSHI: No damage. 
FORREST: Torpedo launchers, fire when ready. 
(The torpedoes light up the web, and Enterprise becomes visible. The Tholians start firing at them.) 
HOSHI: They can see us. 
(Things start to go bang) 
FORREST: Get us out of here. Engineering, disengage the cloak and transfer all power to engines. 
CREWMAN [OC]: The cloak's not responding, sir. 
[USS Defiant - Bridge]
ARCHER: How much longer? 
TUCKER: Maybe you'd like to take a stab at it. 
T'POL: I can activate their systems. 
ARCHER: Stand aside, Commander. 
TUCKER: Almost there. 
(Lights come on, panels activate, and from outside we see the nacelles start to spin up.) 
T'POL: Enterprise is under attack. 
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Hull plating's down. We've lost power on decks C, D and E. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering to Bridge. The containment fields are failing. 
FORREST: Can you vent the antimatter? 
CREWMAN [OC]: Negative. Reactor breach in three minutes. 
FORREST: This is the Captain. All hands to escape pods. Abandon ship. You heard my order! 
HOSHI: What do you think you're doing? 
FORREST: I'll buy you as much time as I can. Get out of here, now. 
[USS Defiant - Bridge]
(The away team have taken their helmets off.) 
T'POL: Enterprise is taking heavy damage. 
ARCHER: Can you bring weapons and engines online? 
TUCKER: I'll see what I can do. 
ARCHER: (referring to the bodies on the floor) Give me a hand with them! 
(Meanwhile, the Enterprise escape pods are being picked off one by one. Forrest is at helm, the doing a Janeway impression.) 
T'POL: Commander. 
(They all look at the viewscreen, as Enterprise explodes inside the Tholian Web.) 
To Be Continued...
